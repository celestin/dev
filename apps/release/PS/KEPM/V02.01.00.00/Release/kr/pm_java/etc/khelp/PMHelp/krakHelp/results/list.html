<p align="left">The Symbol List displays the symbols in your project. At a given time the
Symbol List displays the names of the symbols corresponding to the tab that has been
selected (ie File/Class etc).</p>

<p align="left">The List allows you to sort and select symbols, helping you to quickly
highlight symbols with high metric values or to select only the symbols that you are
currently interested in.</p>
