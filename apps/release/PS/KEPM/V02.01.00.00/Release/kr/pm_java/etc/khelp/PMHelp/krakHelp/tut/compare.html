<p align="left">To compare projects follow the steps in the project creation section of
the tutorial and create two projects (Usually two version of the same project).</p>

<p align="left">By using the "Select Directory" method of project creation Krakatau automatically
sets the "Base Directory" for your projects. The concept of a base directory will be explained fully
in a later section of the online help.</p>

the Metrics\Compare Projects command.</li>
