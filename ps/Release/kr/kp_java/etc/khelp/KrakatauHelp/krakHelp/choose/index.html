<h1 align="center">Choosing Metrics</h1>

<p align="left">In many instances not all of the metrics are needed, therefore, Krakatau
allows the ability to choose which metrics are displayed. As well as this it is possible
to set upper and lower bounds for the metrics. By setting these bounds it can be quickly
ascertained which symbols have values which may be causing problems.</p>
