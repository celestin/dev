<h1 align="center">Class Metrics</h1>

<h3>CSA - Class Size in Attributes</h3>

<p>CSA measures class size by counting the number of attributes of a class (not including
inherited attributes).&nbsp; If a class has a high number of attributes, it may be wise to
consider whether it would be appropriate to divide the class into subclasses. </p>

<h3>CSO - Class Size in Operations</h3>

<p>CSO measures class size by counting the number of operations (methods) in a class (not
including inherited methods).&nbsp; If a class has a high number of methods, it may be
wise to consider whether it would be appropriate to divide the class into subclasses. </p>

<h3>CSAO - Class Size in Attributes and Operations</h3>

<p>CSAO is the sum of CSA and CSO.&nbsp; Results should be interpreted as for the
individual CSA and CSO metrics. </p>

<h3>PPPC - Percentage of Package, Public and Protected members in a Class</h3>

<p>Members which have package level protection are visible to other classes in the same
package.&nbsp; Public members are available to classes in all packages and protected
members are available to subclasses.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; extensive use of such members
violates the encapsulation principle.&nbsp; This metric allows us to see the proportion of
'vulnerable' members in a class.&nbsp; A large proportion of such members means that the
class has high potential to be affected by external classes and means that increased
effort will be needed to test such a class thoroughly. </p>

<h3>NOCC - Number Of Child Classes</h3>

<p>This metric counts the number of classes which inherit from a particular class (i.e.
the number of classes in the inheritance tree down from a class).&nbsp; As this value
increases, it is obvious that the particlar class is being re-used well.&nbsp; However, it
is also important to consider that where there are many child classes, are they all
genuinely appropriate members of the parent class?&nbsp; In this case, the abstraction of
the class may be poor.&nbsp; It is also true that as NOCC increases, the amount of testing
required for each child class will increase. </p>

<h3>DIT - Depth in Class Inheritance Tree</h3>

<p>This metric reports how deeply a class resides in the class inheritance tree.&nbsp;
High values imply that a class is quite specialised. </p>

<h3>RFC - Response For a Class</h3>

<p>This metric measures the number of methods that can be invoked in response to a message
to an object of a class.&nbsp; For larger values of RFC, it is obvious that required
testing effort becomes greater as does the overall design complexity of the class. </p>

<h3>CBO - Coupling Between Object classes</h3>

<p>The value for CBO is the number of classes which a particular class refers to.&nbsp;
This is a measure of how cohesive (and therefore reusable) a particular class is likely to
be.&nbsp; References can be uses of classes as member types, parameter types, method local
variable types or casts. </p>

<h3>LOCM - Lack Of Cohesion of Methods</h3>

<p>LOCM measures the percentage of methods that do not access a specific attribute
averaged over all attributes in the class.&nbsp; A low percentage indicates high coupling
between methods which indicates high testing effort (since many methods can affect the
same attributes) and potentially low reusability. </p>

<h3>NOOC - Number of Operations Overridden by a Class</h3>

<p>NOOC measures the number of inherited operations which a class overrides.&nbsp; High
values for NOOC tend to indicate design problems; subclasses 'should' generally add to and
extend the functionality of the parent classes rather than overriding them. </p>

<h3>NOAC - Number of Operations Added by a Class</h3>

<p>This metric measures the number of operations added by a class (inherited operations
are not counted).&nbsp; As this value becomes larger for a class, the functionality of
that class becomes increasingly distinct from that of the parent classes.&nbsp; In this
case, it should be considered whether this class should genuinely be inheriting from the
parent or if it could be broken down into several, smaller classes. </p>

<h3>WMC - Weighted Methods per Class</h3>

<p>WMC is a count of the methods in a class (weighted according to complexity).&nbsp; The
value of WMC can indicate whether this class is likely to be suitable for re-use. </p>

<h3>CSI - Class Specialisation Index</h3>

<p>CSI provides a measure of specialisation for a class.&nbsp; The higher value for CSI,
the more likely that a particular class does not conform to the abstraction of it's
superclasses. </p>

<h3>OSavg - Average Operation Size</h3>

<p>This metric provides a measure of the average size of the operations (methods) for a
particular class.&nbsp; Any conventional functional metric can be used to determine
operation `size' but the standard cyclomatic complexity metric (and variations of this)
will yield `realistic' results.&nbsp; In OO development, it is desirable to have small,
fine-grained methods, so high&nbsp; values for OSavg are a warning that it may help
improve code quality if some methods in the class were broken down. </p>

<h3>NPavgC - Average Number of Parameters for methods in a Class </h3>

<p>Methods with a high number of parameters generally require considerable testing (as
their input can be highly varied).&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; large numbers of parameters lead to
more complex, less maintainable code.&nbsp; This metric provides an average number of
parameters for methods in a class (not including inherited methods). </p>

<h3>AC - Attribute Complexity</h3>

<p>Attribute Complexity is defined as the sum of R(i) where R(i) is the value of each
attribute in the class evaluated from the table below.&nbsp; Summing R(i)&nbsp;for a class
gives this metric value.&nbsp; AC is from the work of Chen &amp;&nbsp;Lu. <br>

<h3>OpCom - Operation Complexity</h3>

<p>The definition for operation complexity is the sum of O(i) where O(i) is operation i's
complex value as McCabe complexity&nbsp;V(g).&nbsp; Summing the O(i) for each operation in
the class gives this metric value. </p>

<h3>LOC - Lines Of Code comprising a Class</h3>

<p>LOC is a primitive metric to measure the size of a class.&nbsp; It is included for
traditional reasons. <br>
