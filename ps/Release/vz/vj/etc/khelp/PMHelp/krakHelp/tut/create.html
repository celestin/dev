<p align="left">To create a project click on the &quot;New Project&quot; command in the File menu.
You will then be presented with a dialog box, guiding you through the steps of creating a
Krakatau Project.  There are three steps to creating a project in Krakatau.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Create a directory for your project.</b> The first stage of this dialog is to give a name to the project that you
are creating, to do this you must select a directory from the entry box. Click on the
&quot;Browse&quot; button and navigate until you have the desired directory chosen, then
click on &quot;Open&quot;. You then must decide on a name for you project. Once you have
input this information click on the &quot;Next&quot; button of the dialog.
You now have a directory prepared for your project.</li>

<li><b>Choose a project creation method.</b>  With the directory prepared, you can now
choose the type of project creation that you wish to use. Krakatau offers three
methods of project creation: select individual files, a whole directory, or import
directly from a Visual Studio workspace (called "Import Project").
For this tutorial choose the &quot;Select Directory&quot; option and click the &quot;Next&quot;
button of the dialog. The other methods of project creation will be duscussed elsewhere in
the online help.</li>

<li><b>Select the directory you want to use.</b> You will now be presented with a view that allows
you to enter the directory you wish to use. Click on the "Browse" button and choose a directory which
contains source code and click "OK". </li>
</ol>

<p align="left">Once you have completed these steps click on the &quot;Finish&quot; button
of the dialog.</p>
