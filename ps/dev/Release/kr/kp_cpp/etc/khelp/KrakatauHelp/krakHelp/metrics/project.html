<h1 align="center">Project Metrics</h1>

<h3>DPIT - Depth of Project class Inheritance Tree</h3>

<p>This metric measures the maximum depth of the class inheritance tree for the whole
project.&nbsp; Large values for DPIT tend to indicate that leaf classes will be inheriting
many methods and members from parent classes making their behaviour difficult to
predict.&nbsp; Of course, deep inheritance also indicates that classes are less
specialised and so increases possibilities for reuse. </p>

<h3>NORC - Number Of Root Classes</h3>

<p>This measures the number of discrete class hierarchies present in the project.&nbsp; A
large value for NORC will suggest that a large amount of effort for testing will be
required (since test cases for each hierarchy will need to be developed).&nbsp; This
metric must be interpreted carefully where (for example) all classes inherit from the
`Object' class; technically there is only one class hierarchy but notionally and
practically there could be more. </p>

<h3>LOC - Lines Of Code</h3>

<p>Lines Of Code is the traditional measure of size for a project.&nbsp; LOC includes
source code lines, whitespace lines and comment lines and so is a more primitive measure
than SLOC. </p>

<h3>SLOC - Source Lines Of Code</h3>

<p>SLOC measures the number of lines containing actual program source code.&nbsp; SLOC is
LOC minus whitespace lines and comment lines.&nbsp; Because SLOC measures only source code
lines, some consider it a better guide to actual project size than LOC. </p>

<h3>NFILES - Number of Files</h3>

<p>NFILES&nbsp;measures the number of files in a project.&nbsp; This metric is a primitive
measure of project size. </p>

<h3>MHF - Method Hiding Factor</h3>

<p><img SRC="MHF.gif" HEIGHT="230" WIDTH="447"> </p>

<p>MHF is a metric from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite.&nbsp;
MHF is calculated as a fraction.&nbsp; The numerator is the sum of the invisibilities of
all methods defined in all classes.&nbsp; The invisibility of a method is the percentage
of the total classes from which this method is not visible.&nbsp; The MHF denominator is
the total number of methods defined in the project. </p>

<h3>AHF - Attribute Hiding Factor</h3>

<p><img SRC="AHF.gif" HEIGHT="222" WIDTH="480"> </p>

<p>AHF is a metric from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite.&nbsp;
AHF is calculated as a fraction.&nbsp; The numerator is the sum of the invisibilities of
all attributes defined in all classes.&nbsp; The invisibility of an attribute is the
percentage of the total classes from which this method is not visible.&nbsp; The AHF
denominator is the total number of attributes defined in the project. </p>

<h3>MIF - Method Inheritance Factor</h3>

<p><img SRC="MIF.gif" HEIGHT="136" WIDTH="215"> </p>

<p>MIF is a metric from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite and is
calculated as a fraction.&nbsp; The MIF denominator is the sum of inherited methods in all
classes in the project.&nbsp; The MIF denominator is the total number of available methods
(locally defined plus inherited) for all classes. </p>

<h3>AIF - Attribute Inheritance Factor</h3>

<p><img SRC="AIF.gif" HEIGHT="144" WIDTH="223"> </p>

<p>AIF is a metric from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite and is
calculated as a fraction.&nbsp; The AIF numerator is the sum of inherited attributes in
all classes in the project.&nbsp; The AIF denominator is the total number of available
attributes (locally defined plus inherited) for all classes. </p>

<h3>POF - Polymorphism Factor</h3>

<p><img SRC="POF.gif" HEIGHT="154" WIDTH="571"> </p>

<p>POF is a metric from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite and is
calculated as a fraction.&nbsp; The POF numerator is the sum of overriding methods in all
classes.&nbsp; This is the actual number of possible different polymorphic
situations.&nbsp; Indeed, a given message sent to a class can be bound, statically or
dynamically, to a named method implementation.&nbsp; The latter can have as many shapes
(morphos) as the number of times this same method is overridden (in that class's
descendants).&nbsp; The POF denominator represents the maximum number of possible distinct
polymorphic situations for that class as the sum for each class of the number of new
methods multiplied by the number of descendants.&nbsp; This maximum would be the case
where all new methods defined in each class would be overridden in all of their derived
classes. </p>

<h3>COF - Coupling Factor</h3>

<p><img SRC="COF.gif" HEIGHT="119" WIDTH="408"> </p>

<p>COF is a metric from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite and is
calculated as a fraction.&nbsp; The COF denominator stands for the maximum possible number
of couplings in a system with TC classes.&nbsp; The client-supplier relation (represented
by C<sub>c </sub>=&gt; C<sub>s</sub>) means that C<sub>c</sub>(client class) contains at
least one non-inheritance reference to a feature (method or attribute) of class C<sub>s</sub>
(supplier class).&nbsp; The COF numerator then represents the actual number of couplings
not imputable to inheritance. </p>

<h3>AVCALLS - Average number of calls</h3>

<p>The metric measures the average number of calls made by methods and functions in the
call tree. </p>

<h3>AVPATHS - Average Paths</h3>

<p>The average number of paths in the call tree.&nbsp; As the value of this metric
increases, the testing and debugging becomes more difficult.&nbsp; This measures the
difficulty of testing.&nbsp; Applications with large values of component levels may
contain a large number of untested paths that tend to be unexpectedly executed.&nbsp; This
problem can plague client/server applications. </p>

<h3>COM_LOC - Comment Lines of Code</h3>

<p>This metric measures the total number of lines of code in the project which contain
comments. </p>

<h3>COM_RAT - Comment Ratio</h3>

<p>This metric measures the ratio of comment lines of code (COM_LOC) to total lines of
code including whitespace and comments (LOC). </p>

<h3>TCOM_RAT - True Comment Ratio</h3>

<p>This metric measures the ratio of comment lines of code (COM_LOC) to source lines of
code (excluding whitespace and comments (SLOC). </p>
