This metric quantifies how much intercourse the methods of a class have <br>with the member variables of that class.  <br><br>LOCM is calculated by building a list of member variables and a count <br>of the number of references to each variable (usage) in all methods <br>of this class.  <br><br>Then, a sum of the ratios of usage / TotalMethods is calculated.  <br><br>Finally, LOCM is returned as this SumOfRatios / TotalAttributes.<br><br>This is not the original calculation proposed by Chidamber &amp;amp; Kemerer [CHI94], <br>but a revised version by Henderson-Sellers [HEN96].  <br>See <a href="http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~renaat/ca421/LCOM.html">http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~renaat/ca421/LCOM.html</a> for more information.</body>
