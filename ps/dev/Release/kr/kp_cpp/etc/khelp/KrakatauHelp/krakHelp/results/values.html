<p align="left">The Result Viewer initially shows all metric information for a single
symbol. To view the metric information for a particular symbol, select it from the
Symbol List.  If you have entered bound* values for metrics, this view will also
show which symbols are violating those bounds.  When a value violates an upper
bound, the metric is highlighted in red.  When a value violates a lower bound,
the metric is highlighted in blue.  The selected metric is displayed in bold type
in the Metric Code column.  The metric that the symbols are currently being sorted
by is shown in bold.</p>

<p>*For further information on bounds, please see the
<i>Metric Preferences</i> section, under Choosing Metrics.</p>
