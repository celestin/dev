<p align="left">The &quot;Bound Editor&quot; is used to specify bound values for metrics.
Below is a screenshot of the Bounds Editor:</p>

<p>The tabs at the top left allow you to view the metrics for the available types of
symbols. To set bounds locate the metric that you wish to set a bound for, then type in
the value in the entry box. The bound also has to be selected (by clicking on the check
box next to the bound).</p>

<p>The metric bounds can be saved and loaded. Note: there is an example bound file (called
example.kbf) in the Krakatau directory. This can be used both to view the way that
Krakatau displays violating metrics and also as a guide for bounds.</p>
