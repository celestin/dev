<h1 align="center">Giving your Project a Name</h1>

<p align="left">The first stage of creating a project within Krakatau is to give the
project a name.</p>

<p align="left">The first step is to select the destination directory for your project -
this is the directory where Krakatau will place the project file. To do this click on the
&quot;Browse&quot; button below the &quot;Destination Directory&quot; entry. You can then
navigate to the directory where you wish this project to be created. Note: if you know the path
for the directory you can type it directly into the entry box.</p>

<p align="left">You must then give your project a name - this can be anything. The extension
for a Krakatau project is &quot;.prj&quot; this will be appended to the name given to the
project (unless you add it manually).</p>
