<body><h2><b>WMC</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Weighted Methods in Class</h2>
WMC is the sum of the Cyclomatic complexity for all methods in the class.  <br>This number reflects the complexity of the class, and will be affected not <br>only by the V(g) of each method but also the number of methods.  <br><br>Classes with WMC larger than <b>100</b> should perhaps be redesigned.</body>
