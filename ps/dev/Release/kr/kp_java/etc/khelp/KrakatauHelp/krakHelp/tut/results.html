<p align="left">When the metrics have been calculated Krakatau displays a window with the
results. This window contains most of the features of Krakatau - - this tutorial
considers only the main aspects of the Result Viewer.</p>

<p align="left">This tutorial covers two ways of viewing the metric results.
First, the results as they are shown initially, giving the actual value of each
metric for all symbols in your project. Second, the Histogram view is explained -
the histogram gives a method of comparing metric values for different symbols.</p>
