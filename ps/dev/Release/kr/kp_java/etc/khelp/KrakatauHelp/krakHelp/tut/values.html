<h1 align="center">Metric Values</h1>

<p align="left">Initially, the Result Viewer will display Values for your project.
These are the metric values for the symbols in your project. For each symbol, values are
shown for all metrics that correspond with that symbol. The metrics that are shown depend
on the type of symbol that is being examined, for example if you have a file selected then
file metric information will be shown - similarly if you are looking at the metric
information for a method then method metrics will be displayed.</p>

<p align="left">To navigate within your project in this view click on a symbol in
the symbol list (to the left of the user interface). The metric
values for that symbol will then be shown in the result pane (to the right of the user
interface). The tabs at the top left of the interface can be selected to show list of
corresponding symbols. Therefore to look at method metrics for your
project click on the Method tab. This will show a list of methods in the symbol
list. You can then select a method and view metric information.</p>
