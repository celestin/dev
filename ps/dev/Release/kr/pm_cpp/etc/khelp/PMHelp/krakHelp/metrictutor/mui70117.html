<body><h2><b>V(G)</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Cyclomatic Complexity</h2>
Cyclomatic Complexity (v(G)) is a measure of the complexity of the method's decision<br>structure. It is the number of linearly independent paths and therefore, the minimum <br>number of paths that should be tested.<br><br>A v(G) value greater than 7 may indicate an overly complex method.</body>
