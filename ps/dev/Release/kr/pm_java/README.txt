Licenses
========

Krakatau PM V2.0 requires a license to run. A 7-day evalutaion license can be obtained
contacting Power Software.

FLEXlm
------

Krakatau uses FLEXlm as a license manager and gives three types of licenses:

Evaluation
----------

These allow you to use most of the functionality of Krakatau for a specified period
of time (7 days).

Host-Locked
-----------

This type of license gives access to the full functionality of the tool but is
restricted to a specific computer (by the computer's hostname).

Floating
--------

Floating Licenses are the most flexible licenses - these licenses are controlled
by a license server and allows user at different computers to have access to the
licenses when they are not being used.

To install a floating license you must download and install a license server for
FLEXlm for the platform that you will be running the server.

Instructions can be found at http://www.globetrotter.com/.
