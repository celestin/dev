    <td><img src="../../images/symbols/sgl_right.gif" width="23" height="23"></td>
    <td>Add the highlighted file or directory from the left list to the right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../../images/symbols/dbl_right.gif" width="23" height="23"></td>
    <td>Recursively add all files from the current directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../../images/symbols/sgl_left.gif" width="23" height="23"></td>
