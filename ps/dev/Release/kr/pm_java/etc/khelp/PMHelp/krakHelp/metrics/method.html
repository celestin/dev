<h1 align="center">Method Metrics</h1>

<h3>NP - Number of Parameters</h3>

<p>NP is simply a measure of the number of parameters that a method accepts.&nbsp; High
values for NP can mean that a metric will require extensive testing (since the range of
possible inputs may be greater).&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, methods with many parameters
also tend to be more specialised and so are less likely to be reusable. </p>

<h3>V(G) - Cyclomatic Complexity</h3>

<p>Cyclomatic Complexity measures the number of possible paths through an algorithm by
counting the number of distinct regions on a flowgraph. This represents the cognitive
complexity of the method. </p>

<h3>V'(G) - Enhanced Cyclomatic Complexity</h3>

<p>V'(G) brings together the notions of cyclomatic and operational complexity (by dividing
OC by V(G)).&nbsp; This provides the average operational complexity for decision points in
a method and is a strong indicator of the overall cognitive complexity of the method. </p>

<h3>eV(G) - Essential Complexity</h3>

<p>eV(G) is a measure of the structure of testable paths in a component.&nbsp; Values
exceeding the threshold (7) usually signal an unstructured implementation of control
logic.&nbsp; To calculate, we develop a directed graph to represent the control structure
of the logical unit.&nbsp; This graph should contain only the four basic and simple
structured constructs: sequence, selection, iteration and case.&nbsp; We only keep
structures which contain occurences of unstructured constructs (break, continue, goto) and
recalculate complexity on this graph.&nbsp; This measures the difficulty and feasibility
of the testing as the presence of unstructured constructs increases effort of testing as
well as future code modifications. </p>

<h3>LOC - Method Lines Of Code</h3>

<p>LOC is a primitive metric to measure the size of a method.&nbsp; It is included for
traditional reasons. </p>

<h3>OC - Operational Complexity</h3>

<p>This metric assigns weights to operations which can occur in expressions.&nbsp; The
values of weights for all the expressions in a method are summed to provide a value for
OC.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; complementary to V(G) since it looks at the complexity of the
expressions which are being evaluated rather than the number of decision points in the
method. </p>

<h3>RLOC - Relative Lines Of Code</h3>

<p>This metric measures the lines of code in a method relative to the containing
class.&nbsp; This is a primitive means to measure the proportional significance of a
method. </p>

<h3>NEST - Maximum Number of Levels</h3>

<p>Since the 1950's, cognitive sciences studies have shown that groups that contain more
than seven pieces of information are increasingly harder for people to understand in
problem solving.&nbsp; To measure this, we count the number of If...Then or
If...Then...Elses in a nest.&nbsp; Logical units with a large number of nested levels may
need implementation simplification and process improvement. </p>

<h3>N1 - Total Number of Operators</h3>

<p>N1 is the total number of operators used in a file.&nbsp; This is used as an input to
the Halstead Software Science metrics. </p>

<h3>N2 - Total Number of Operands</h3>

<p>N2 is the total number of operands used in a file.&nbsp; This is used as an input to
the Halstead Software Science metrics. </p>

<h3>n1 - Number of Unique Operators</h3>

<p>n1 is the number of unique operators used in a file.&nbsp; This is used as an input to
the Halstead Software Science metrics. </p>

<h3>n2 - Number of Unique Operands</h3>

<p>n2 is the number of unique operands used in a file.&nbsp; This is used as an input to
the Halstead Software Science metrics. </p>

<h3>N - Halstead Program Length</h3>

<p>N is calculated as N1+N2 and is a general measure of program length for a given file. </p>

<h3>n - Halstead Program Vocabulary</h3>

<p>n is calculated as n1+n2 and is a measure of the number of unique operands and
operators used in a particular file.&nbsp; This can provide an impression <br>
of comprehensibility/complexity for that file. </p>

<h3>V - Halstead Program Volume</h3>

<p>V is the program volume metric from the Halstead Software Science metrics.&nbsp; This
is calculated as V=N*(LOG2 n). </p>

<h3>D - Halstead Difficulty</h3>

<p>D is the difficulty metric from the Halstead Software Science metrics.&nbsp; This is
calculated as D=(n1/n2)*(N2/n2). </p>

<h3>E - Halstead Effort</h3>

<p>E is the effort metric from the Halstead Software Science metrics.&nbsp; This is
calculated as E=D*V. </p>

<h3>CALLS - Number of Calls</h3>

<p>CALLS is the number of calls from a method/function to subordinate logical units
(methods/functions).&nbsp; This is a measure of the degree of FAN-OUT. </p>

<h3>BRANCH - Number of Branching Nodes</h3>

<p>Higher values indicate possible use of &quot;gotos&quot; and/or abnormal exits from
control structures such as loops.&nbsp; This problem is an indicator of unstructured
design and increases the testing difficulty.&nbsp; For components written in C, a higher
value may be permitted due to the legitimate use of C &quot;breaks&quot; in a
&quot;switch&quot; statement. </p>

<h3>OAC - Operation Argument Complexity</h3>

<p>OAC is defined as the sum of P(i) where P(i) is the value of each argument i in each
operation in the class evaluated from the table below. <br>

<h3>ANION - Adjusted Number of Input/Output Nodes</h3>

<p>ANION is an adjusted measure of the number of input/output nodes in a given
method/function.&nbsp; Programming practices today state that there should be one way into
a module and one way out.&nbsp; This measures the difficulty of testing the control logic
of the software.&nbsp; Logical units with a large number of input/output nodes may need
implementation simplification and process imrovement.&nbsp;&nbsp; ANION is adjusted to
behave intelligently where redundant &quot;return&quot; statements exist. </p>

<h3>NION - Number of Input/Output Nodes</h3>

<p>NION is a measure of the number of input/output nodes in a given method/function.&nbsp;
Programming practices today state that there should be one way into a module and one way
out.&nbsp; This measures the difficulty of testing the control logic of the
software.&nbsp; Logical units with a large number of input/output nodes may need
implementation simplification and process imrovement.&nbsp;&nbsp; ANION is adjusted to
behave intelligently where redundant &quot;return&quot; statements exist. </p>

<h3>CONTROL - Number of control statements</h3>

<p>This is a measure of the number of control statements (selection, iteration) in a
method/function. </p>

<h3>EXEC - Number of executable statement</h3>

<p>This is a measure of the number of executable statements in a method/function. </p>

<h3>NSTAT - Number of statements</h3>

<p>NSTAT is a measure of the total number of statements in a method/function.&nbsp; This
is calculated as CONTROL+EXEC. </p>

<h3>CDENS - Control Density</h3>

<p>This is a measure of the &quot;richness&quot; of decision nodes in a module.&nbsp; A
high density module will be more difficult to maintain than a less dense one.&nbsp; We
count the number of control statements and the number of complex executable
statements.&nbsp; Control density is the ratio of control statements to the total number
of statements. </p>

<h3>QCP_MAINT - Quality Criteria Profile (Maintainability)</h3>

<p>MAINTAINABILITY=3 * Halstead Length + Number of statements + Maximum levels + 2 *
Cyclomatic Number + Number of Branching Nodes </p>

<h3>QCP_CRCT - Quality Criteria Profile (Correctness)</h3>

<p>CORRECTNESS=Halstead Difficulty + Number of statements + 2 * Cyclomatic Number </p>
