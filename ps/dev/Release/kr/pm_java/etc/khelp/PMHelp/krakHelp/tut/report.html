created by Krakatau.</p>

<p align="left">To do this, in the Result Viewer window, click on the HTML Report command
in the Reports menu. You will then be presented with a file dialog box. Navigate to the
directory where you wish the Report to be created and click &quot;Open&quot;.</p>

project there may be many HTML files created in the directory that you choose - therefore
