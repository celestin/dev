<!--See more of your Java code Visual i ze t! Creating projects in Vizualizeit! is very straightforward. Firstly, Browse for a destination directory for the project file, and specify the project file name. Create Project Browse for the directory containing your source.  If required, sub-folders can be recursed so that you spend the minimum amount fo time including source files. Once you have created a project, select it then click on the "Parse Project" button.  Parsing the project allows Vizualizeit! to build a database of relationships and dependancies. Parse Java Source During parsing, Vizualizeit! will display a progress bar showing progress through the current phase (top) and overall progress (bottom). The Symbol Properties Rollup shows information about the currently selected  symbol.  Here, a package has been selected.   The "Info" tab is always available, and other tabs are shown depending on  the symbol's type.  Here "Contents" is also shown: listing the files within  the package. Symbol Info The Symbol Properties Rollup changes as you select different  symbols in the project tree, and within the source viewer  and graphs. The current symbol is also shown at the bottom right of  the window. For a Class, "Contents" and "Heirarchy" are available. The "Contents" tab for a Class shows Methods and Classes within the Class. These Methods and Classes may be dragged from the Rollup onto graph and source viewer windows. The "Heirarchy" tab for a Class shows its Superclass (if appropriate) and any Subclasses. The Symbol Properties Rollup alone can help you become familiar with your source code. Right-clicking on a symbol in the project tree, provides you with a Popup menu.  From the Popup you can open the symbol in the source viewer, 2D and 3D graphs. Here, a 3D Containment graph has been opened for a package. 3D Graph This 3D Graph  is similar to the previous shot, except that full names are displayed.  Names can be toggled on and off for greater clarity. 3D Containment graphs can help you visualize where code  is located and how it is organised.  The above file contains  one class that has four methods.  Larger files, with more classes will become easier to comprehend with a 3D Containment graph.  In this example, most of the file relates to the MacButtonUI (as the name suggests), but a listener has been coded here too. Hide names to get a clearer view of the structure of larger files, packages, classes or interfaces. Rotate, zoom and pan a 3D graph to virtually "play" with  the structure. A 3D graph starts with the symbol you selected, and it's children... Double-clicking on a symbol expands it's children... Right-clicking on a symbol displays a Popup menu.   In this case, we will View Source for the "FocusBorder" class. View Java Source The View Source window opens the relevant file and moves the  cursor to the first line of the symbol's source. The source is keyword-highlighted as you click on different symbols within the source, the Symbol Properties Rollup to reflect the current symbol. The Find Rollup allows you to search for symbols within the database. You can specify the usual Find options, and also the type of the symbol for which you are searching.  Results are returned in a list with Name and symbol Type. Find Symbol From the results you can right-click on any symbol, and expect to see a Popup menu offering the options. The "Locate in Tree" feature is particularly usual here.  When clicked, the project tree is expanded so that the symbol you  requested is selected... ...notice how the "createDirectoryComboBoxModel" method has been selected, and it's siblings and parent are easily identifiable. The 2D Containment graph shows a symbol's children in an orderly way.  Double-clicking on a child symbol expands it to show further children. 2D Graph Quickly identify methods within a class in this easy-to-understand traditional view. The 2D Cross-Reference Graph allows you to quickly visualize all references to and from a method.  Any references that are not resolved to source within the project remain in white boxes.
