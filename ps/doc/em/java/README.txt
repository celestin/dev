Essential Metrics (Java)
========================

Thank you for installing Essential Metrics.

Essential Metrics is a command line tool which will allow
you to get metric information from your Java source code.

To run Essential Metrics run emetrics at the command line
this will display the available options for Essential
Metrics.

Note: A file containing the list of files (one file per
line) in your project is required to run Essential
Metrics. One can obtain such a list by running the 'dir'
command as follows:

dir /s /b

Would list all of the files in the current directory
and all its subdirectories. To obtain only certain files
the follow command could be executed:

dir /s /b *.java *.jav

Would give only files with 'java' and 'jav' extensions
extension.

To create the filelist you can use the above command and
direct the output to a file as follows:

dir /s /b *.java *.jav > flist.txt

Which would give a filelist called flist.txt in the
correct format.
