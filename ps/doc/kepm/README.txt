
Krakatau Essential Project Manager (KEPM)
=========================================

Please read the UserGuideKEPM.pdf to learn how to operate KEPM.

KEPM supports multiple parser language types.  By default these are:
 * ADA (files ending .a, .ada, .adb, .ads)
 * ASP (files ending .asp, .aspx)
 * C# as before (files ending .cs)
 * IDL (files ending .idl)
 * Java (files ending .java)
 * PHP (files ending .php)
 * PL/SQL (files ending .sql, .ora)
 * Perl (files ending .pl)
 * VB6/VB.NET (files ending .vb, .frm, .cls, .bas)
 * VHDL (files ending .vhdl)
 * C/C++ (all other file extensions)

Please consult UserGuide.pdf for detailed information regarding
the EPM XML Configuration file that can be used to modify how
EPM parses your files, based on your naming conventions.

Simply include the files together in any order and EPM will
automatically differentiate for you!
