<h1>Krakatau Online Help</h1>

<p>The help is split into several sections. The first section runs through a brief
tutorial covering the main aspects of Krakatau use. The tutorial should be the first reference point
for new users. It shows the basic features and gives the user a feel for the Krakatau
tool. The remaining sections of the help provide more detail on topics described in the
tutorial as well as introducing the more advanced functionality of the tool. If you encounter
problems please consult the Trouble Shooting section of this help.</p>
