<h1 align="center">Histogram View</h1>

<p>The Histogram view, accessed by clicking on the Histogram tab, compares a value for a
chosen metric over a selection of symbols. This is useful for ascertaining which symbols
have high and low metric values.</p>

<p>To compare several symbols, select them from the Symbol List. These will then be
displayed as a bar graph in the Results Pane.  At the top of the Histogram View is
a pull down list of metrics. You can use this list to select a different metric for
the Histogram View.</p>

<p>Note: when the symbols are sorted in the Symbol List the histogram is updated to
show the symbol that the list is being sorted by.</p>
