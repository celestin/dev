<p align="left">The Kiviat view, which can be accessed by the Kiviat tab, shows the
average for metrics values over selected symbols.</p>

<p align="left">Note: before the Kiviat View can be used bounds have to be set in the
Bound Editor.</p>

<p align="left">The following is an example of a Kiviat:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../images/graph/kiviat.jpg" width="443" height="429"
alt="kiviat.jpg (32380 bytes)"></p>

<p align="left">The inner circle signifies the lower bound for each metric, the outer
circle signifies the upper bound. Therefore, all metrics values which are between the
inner and outer circles (shown green above) are not violating bounds.</p>

<p align="left">If only one symbol (from the Symbol list) is selected then the Kiviat
Diagram shows which values are violating bounds for that symbol. When more than one symbol
is selected then the nodes in the Kiviat Diagram are averages for the selected symbols. </p>
