<!--To create a project within Essential Metrics, you must  provide the tool with a list of files to analyse. You can generate such a list in a two of ways: 1. From a Windows command prompt Change to the directory containing the source code.  If  the code exists in a subdirectory structure, go to the  top-most level. dir /b /s *.cpp *.c *.h >c:\results\files.txt 2. Export from tools like ClearCASE ClearCASE allows you to export a file list to a text file.   All that is required is a list containg the full path to  each file, separated by newlines. Project Creation ; {   } Metrics // * Typing "emetrics" on it's own, or with the -? option shows  the help screen above. emetrics has been run above, specifying files.txt and a CSV  report to results.csv. Command-line options Essential Metrics  offers a number of reporting options  to enable you do the most with your metrics results. CSV Reporting  is a straight-forward, single file report,  for import into other applications such as Database or  Spreadsheet. HTML Reporting  comes in two varieties: Single page - All the results are written to one HTML  file.  This is useful for smaller projects, or where you  wish to search or print all the data. Multi-page - A complete navigation system is provided,  allowing technical staff or management to quickly  navigate through larger project results. XML Reporting  is provided for integration with web- based systems. Reports CSV results can be easily opened using a spreadsheet for  further analysis. If you are using Windows and Excel, you can simply  double-click on a file with .csv extension; this will launch  Excel and allow you to manipulate the data (sort, move,  etc.) or graph... CSV Reports A simple bar chart was created from a group files.  We can  quickly see the relationships between Lines of code (LOC),  Source lines of code (SLOC) and Comment lines of Code  (CLOC). Graph produced from Excel and .csv report file from Essential Metrics This area graph shows SLOC, McCabe complexity [V(G)]  and Number of Semicolons (NSC).   Use a pie chart for more dramatic effect to show the  relationship between Methods. HTML Reporting  comes in two varieties: Single page  - All the results are written to one HTML  file.  This is useful for smaller projects, or where you  wish to search or print all the data. Multi-page  - A complete navigation system is  provided, allowing technical staff or management to  quickly navigate through larger project results. As well as choosing between Single and Multi page  varieties, you may also have Standard or Grid reports:  - Each Symbol is listed with a table beneath  with all it's metrics.  This report fits the width of the  screen and is useful when looking at all the metric  values for one Symbol.  - The report is presented in one grid, with Symbol  names in the first column and metric names in the first  row.  The grid report generally doesn't fit on one page  but is useful when looking at metric values for many  Symbols. HTML Single page - Standard Each symbol is listed with all its metrics in a single  table underneath.  This allows easy examination of  symbols individually.  This report always fits the width  of the screen, making it simple to print. HTML Single page - Grid The grid report shows all symbols of a given type (File,  Class, Method, etc) in a single table.  Normally this page is  wider than the page, but is very useful for comparing  values of a specific metric across a range of symbols. Single page (grid) HTML Multi-page - Standard The multi-page reports feature full navigation, using a  series of indexes and frames.  It is very quick and easy  to navigate your way through any size of project. HTML Multi-page - Standard Clicking on links, opens up the related HTML file and  moves to the correct point in the file. HTML Multi-page - Grid As before, the grid option puts all the information into  one large table.  Combining this with the navigation,  you can grasp metric results at all levels. Multi-page (grid) XML The XML report is designed for customers with a  specific requirement for raw XML data. There are many good reasons to buy  Essential Metrics .
