    <p>We carry an extensive range of injector and pump spares allowing us to carry out
    repairs quickly and efficiently. Our staff of specialist engineers are based
    just a stone's throw from Aberdeen harbour, one of the busiest oil industry service
    ports in the UK.</p>

    <p>We are not limited to the Aberdeen area, however.
    We supply marine fuel injection equipment throughout the UK and abroad,
    to places as diverse as Brazil, Gibraltar and Nigeria.</p>

    <p><span class=am>Airylea Motors</span> can completely overhaul your fuel injection
    systems from top to bottom, testing and replacing all components such as plungers,
    springs, valves and screws. Our Hartridge test benches are of the most modern design
    and are equal to testing almost every size of fuel injector pump.</p>
