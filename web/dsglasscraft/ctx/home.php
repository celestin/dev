  <td class="main"><p>After 23 years as Head Lampworker at Perthshire Paperweights in Crieff,
  I opened my own glass workshop in Perth in March 2002.</p>

  <p>I create these highly detailed and collectable pieces using coloured glass rods
  fused together in a propane/oxygen flame.  No painting involved!</p>

  <p>Because of the nature of the glass and agate, each piece is totally unique, some taking hours to complete.</p></td>

  </tr><tr>

  <td class="main" colspan=2><p>These pictures show examples of my work,
  but as each one is hand made, none of these can be recreated exactly.

  I try to match the glass animal/bird to each individual agate, and vice versa.</p>
