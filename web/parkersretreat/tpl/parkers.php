<td colspan=2>Once a milking parlour and cart shed, which had sadly fallen into tragic disrepair,
rescued by its present owner, now lovingly and sympathetically restored to provide
delightful and elegant living with a contemporary twist.</td>

<td class=tabtop colspan=2>The accommodation split over two levels has a maximum occupancy of six.
The name derived from the owner’s love of Jazz.</td>

<td colspan=2>With its outstanding slightly elevated position
and southerly aspect, Parker’s commands panoramic views across a rural landscape,
to the East the distant spires of Montrose, South across the undulating countryside
to the ancient forest of Montreathmont.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td class=tabtop>Set in its own private grounds a gravel drive leads to the front of the house,
with ample parking at the side. A South facing patio offers uninterrupted views
across the countryside, beyond a small lawn with herbaceous borders.</td>

<td>Following a country lane leads to Parker’s secluded orchard.
Enter by crossing its own private bridge. A delightful haven filled with apple,
pear and plum trees, a small stream passes through an idyllic spot to
laze in the heat of the summer afternoons to recline in a hammock,
listen to the bird song and flowing water.</td>

<td colspan=2>The owner lives nearby in Greenden Farmhouse, which dates back to 1750.
She is there to welcome you on arrival and will offer suggestions for
excursions depending on whether you wish a relaxed holiday by the beach or,
possibly to visit one of the County’s stunning private gardens which are open
to the public, wildlife watching on one of the many nearby reserves or for the
more energetic venturing into the nearby Cairngorm National park for some
elusive Munro bagging.</td>
