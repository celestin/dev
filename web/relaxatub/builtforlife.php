      <h3>Structure Built to Last</h3>

      <p id="builttolast">A Beachcomber 750 hot tub filled with water can weigh as much as your car... that is a lot of water held by this vessel and
        it needs to be built correctly. That is why we back every Beachcomber Hot Tub with 7 to 10 coats
        of liquid fibreglass, with our own formulation of Glassloc 2000 bonding material between the shell
        and the fibreglass. These layers are immediately hand rolled right after application to ensure an
        air tight, sealed bond. Once the curing process is complete in our factory assembly line, the
        structure of the hot tub is built to last. With contoured, rounded seating, structural integrity is
        maximised to last a lifetime.</p>

      <h3>Wide Rolled Lip Design for Ease and Safety</h3>

      <p id="builttolast">Our trademark Wide Rolled Lip design is well made, unique and completely functional.
      With integrated body molded hand grips, it looks beautiful and allows you to enjoy your hot tub with ease and safety.
      Our lip design enhances proper structure and at the same time maximizes usability and space inside for people. When it rains,
      our lip design repels water away from the cabinetry to run down the vertical slats in our tongue and groove
      Enviroskirt and away from the hot tub.</p>

      <h3>I-Beam Seat Support</h3>

      <p id="builttolast">Many manufacturers cut corners in production to save costs, increase profits and build more quickly.
      Beachcomber has the slowest production line found anywhere. Why? Because we truly believe that a hot tub should be built to last.
      We know that when our hot tub arrives at your home, the true test of our engineering begins. We want your experience to be the
      best, so that you will refer your friends. Our I-Beam Supports beneath each seat proves our commitment to quality of structure,
      because you deserve the best.</p>
