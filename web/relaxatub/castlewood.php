    ourselves of what we are buying.  When buying a new car you would book a test drive it to see
    how it handles and how comfortable your passengers are.</p>

    <p class="desc">Why should buying a <b>Beachcomber Hot Tub</b> be any different?</p>

    <p class="desc">Book a short break away at the luxurious but affordably-priced
    <a href="http://www.castlewoodleisure.com/lodges.htm">Castlewood Leisure &amp; Holiday Park</a>,
    where most of the lodges include a Beachcomber Hot Tub supplied by us.</p>

    <p class="desc">Imagine starting each day in the heart of Royal Deeside massaged by the invigorating jets of a hot tub.
    Relax in the evening as you soak in its warm water.  We can't think of a better way to try it for yourself!</p>
