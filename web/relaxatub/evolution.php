  <td class="hte3" valign=top>Hippies in the late 60's understood the value of freedom
  and improving their quality of life.  They shared free love and free speech
  while enjoying soaking in hot water outdoors.  This marked the start of the
  evolution of hot tubs.</td>
  <td class="hte3a" valign=top>Boat makers in southern climates began building fiberglass
  gelcoat spas.  They made spa shells for in-ground installation that a handyman
  could piece together.  It was a lot of work, but well worth the effort for
  the soaking they provided.</td>
  <td class="hte3" valign=top>The spa industry grew slowly as it gradually developed a
  complete, integrated spa unit that made buying and using a hot tub a whole lot
  easier.  Small, regional manufacturers sprang up all over North America to supply
  the needs of this new market.  Building an energy efficient spa was not
  important.</td>
  <td class="hte3a" valign=top rowspan=2>Hot tubs gained wider appeal among home owners interested
  in improving the home.  They began to accept hot tubsas an appliance - a self-contained
  unit that happened to be outdoors.  With the pace of daily life increasing rapidly,
  reducing stress became a big attraction.  Beachcomber focused on hydrotherapy
  and energy efficiency as part of building a better hot tub.</td>
  <td class="hte3" valign=top rowspan=2>Beachcomber's breakthrough engineering creates the world's
  most comfortable hot tub without sacrificing energy efficiency.  Our cab forward
  design made more interior room inside the hot tub while making it possible to
  insulate all four walls, just like the most energy efficient home.  The design also
  gives you an extra outside step for safety entering and leaving your hot tub.</td>

  <td class="hte3a" valign=top rowspan=2>Keith Scott has made it his personal mission to provide Beachcomber
  owners with continual improvements, to give them the best quality, performance,
  reliability and simplicity in every hot tub we build.  Beachcomber has
  built its business on continuing to improve their product daily, to give
  their customers at time of sale the latest technology at no extra cost.</td>
