    style="float:right;padding:0 10px 5px 15px"/>Decking is a superb way to enhance any home or garden.
    If you are thinking about a hot tub, adding decking will finish that area of your
    garden and attractively complement your tub.<br><br>

    A natural product in harmony with the environment, decking lends itself to a tremendous variety of
    forms and styles - all of which bring added beauty and value to any building or landscape.
    Timber decking is highly flexible - and provides extra social space that&#039;s ideal for children playing,
    dining, entertaining, or just simply relaxing in your tub. Whatever the reasons for creating a deck, it&#039;s one of the
    most attractive additions that can be made to a home.</p>

    <p class="desc">At Relaxatub we have our own small team of craftsmen who can design and build decking to complement your
    garden and hot tub.</p>
