    <p class="desc2">Hot Tubs are great fun but evidence shows they are also very good for the Human body.</p>

    <p class="desc2">Immersion in hot swirling water has been known for centuries for its medicinal benefits.</p>

    <p class="desc2">At water temperatures of 35 degrees C there is an increase in cardiac output of up
    to 35% and these changes are magnified with the increasing temperatures, so that at 37 degrees C the
    cardiac output is increased 100%.  The body is exercised as much by using a Hot Tub as it would be
    jogging.  The Haemoglobin or red blood cells count drop in the first half hour and indicates that
    a movement of fluid in the body is taking place.  It appears that fluid in the joints returns
    to the blood and toxins are neutralised.  Haemodilation, therefore is probably an important
    factor in the benefit brought suffers of rheumatism and arthritis when using a hot tub.</p>

    <p class="desc2">The moving water provides a general massage, which increases circulation
    and the pulsating action of the jets is ideal for treating lower back pain.  Hot water is a great
    way to treat brusing as it allows the body to re-absorb the haemoglobin products by opening up
    circulation channels so allowing greater ease of absorption.  The kind of water therapy has been
    found to aid mental relaxation and concentration.</p>

    <p class="desc2">As time goes by more and more evidence comes forward to prover that
    hyrdotherapy is not only fun, its very beneficial for you too!</p>
