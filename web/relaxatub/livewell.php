        Why go half way around the world cooped up with sneezing, coughing strangers?
        <b>For the cost of just one two-week traditional holiday for a family of four, you could be relaxing in a Beachcomber Hot Tub for many years to come</b>.
        That's what we take holidays for: to get away from it all.  So why do we feel like we need a holiday when we get home?
        With a Beachcomber Hot Tub, you can get that holiday feeling right in the privacy of your own home, every time you feel you
        need it.  Long after the expensive tans would have faded, you would still be enjoying your Beachcomber escape; relieving stress,
        relaxing and improving your health with family and friends.</p>

          <p id="block1"><b>The benefits of hydrotherapy</b> have been known for thousands of yeras &mdash; it's one of the safest and most natural
          ways to treat common ailments.  Hydrotherapy uses three of nature's powerful pain relief agents: heat, water and air to
          invigorate and gently massage the body to ease away aches and pains, and relieve stress.</p>

          <p id="block2"><b>Vacations are about relaxing,</b> rejuvenating and reconnecting with yourself and your family.  Hot tubs bring these
          elements of prized holidays to your garden year round.  A hot tub can bring you a slice of holiday every day without leaving home.</p>

          <p id="block1"><b>Soak your way to better health.</b> The health benefits of a hot tub go beyond relieving the pain of sore and achy muscles.
          Hot tubs can help prevent and manage chronic health conditions by lowering blood pressure, improving circulation, opening pores,
          helping rid your body of toxins, and more.</p>

        <p>The human body is a superb machine &mdash; but like all machines, it needs regular maintenance!  Water is the
        traditional source of healing for aches and pains, even before the Romans who made the public 'baths' famous.
        Sinking deep into warm, massaging water bring physical relaxation, releasing the strain on sore joints.
        Flowing, warm water with deep seating helps you to completely relax tense muscle fibres, sore joints and ligaments.</p>

        <p id="temperature">Increasing the body's temperature to 103&deg;F / 39.4&deg;C increases the number of virus and bacteria
        fighting white blood cells three-fold.  Most flu and cold viruses don't multiply above 101.6&deg;F / 38.6&deg;C.  The
        warmed blood enlarges blood vessels, and releases and unclogs nasal passages.  Your circulation adjusts to the change with a slight
        increase in blood pressure, penetrating through to deeper tissue, and allows the blood to carry more oxygen and nutrients.
        Your increased heart rate and respiration increases, helping to eliminate metabolic waste that collects in muscle tissue.
        Your immune system is stimulated, antibody production increases and pain melts away.</p>

        <p>Recent studies show that everyday life produces anxiety, pain, fatigue, poor energy levels, motion problems,
        lack of sleep and more.  Medication with side effects, expensive therapy and strenuous exercise are ways to deal with stress.
        But you can also control and relieve daily stress and tension by soaking in a Beachomber for just 15 minutes every other day.</p>
