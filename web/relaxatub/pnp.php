    <h3>The Barcelona</h3>

    <p><span class="feature">Attractive design.</span>
    The Barcelona's attractive octagonal design gives it flexibility for most situations, from personal use for two people, to a sociable party tub,
    that can easily accomodate multiple bathers.</p>

    <p><span class="feature">Powerful experience.</span>
    A robust 14 jet system creates a powerful massage experience that will be trouble-free for years to come.</p>

    <p><span class="feature">Digital temperature control</span>
    will allow you to precisely adjust the water temperature right up to 40 degrees Celcius.  This gives you
    the flexibility to use your hot tub all year round including colder winter months.</p>

    <p><span class="feature">Multicoloured light</span>
    gives a soft glow of single colour or a rainbow of colours rotating through the water.</p>

  <div id="sttropez">
    <img border=0 src="img/pnp/sttropez1.png" alt="Relaxatub Plug'n'play St Tropez Hot Tub" />

    <h3>The St Tropez</h3>

    <p><span class="feature">Elegant design.</span>
    Its clever versatile design accomodates four people in a variety of relaxation zones, from an extra deep corner to a dual-person
    recliner with calf and thigh massage jets, helping to massage away the troubles of your day.</p>

    <p><span class="feature">Powerful experience.</span>
    A two-speed pump and 18 jets, adjustable for direction and pressure, allow precise control of your massage experience.</p>

    <p><span class="feature">Digital temperature control</span>
    will allow you to precisely adjust the water temperature right up to 40 degrees Celcius.  This gives you
    the flexibility to use your hot tub all year round including colder winter months.</p>

    <p><span class="feature">Lighting system.</span>
    A full spectrum coloured lighting system will add to your experience at night, illuminating the water as rays of light refract
    through the lens and bounce off the contours of the tub.</p>
