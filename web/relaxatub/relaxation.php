    <p class="desc">Every year we try and spend away from the trials and tribulations of daily
    life with a holiday.  For months we plan and look forward to the pampering and relaxation
    we hope to find.  If it all turns out according to plan we return with a lot less money,
    memories, a fading sun-tan, and start dreaming about getting away again.</p>

    <p class="desc">With a Beachcomber Hot Tub that year-round dream could easily become
    a reality with no timezones, crowds, flight-delays, taxis, etc.  Just the magic of warm
    massaging water, music, lights and fragrances in a totally peaceful outdoor setting
    right outside your back door.</p>

    <p class="desc">Recreate the Family gathering place so often missed in today's busy
    lifestyle.</p>
