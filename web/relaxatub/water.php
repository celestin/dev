    <h3>Maximised Jetting Power</h3>

    <p id="maximise">The biggest difference you will notice with Beachcomber is the incredible AllActive Seating jetting massage therapy.
    What does this mean?  At the simple touch of a button, all seats in a Beachcomber can be activated at the same time.
    Most manufacturers today can not make this happen and break up their spas into zones of '3 or 4 massaging seats only' running at the
    same time thus under-delivering jet massageing for their users.  We took a different approach with our AllActive Seating engineering,
    and made sure that every person in each of the seats can have the maximum jetting massage power at the same time.</p>

    <h3>Customisation of Jetting Massage</h3>

    <p>Beachcomber's Jetting massage is fully adjustable, providing you with the exact type of massage you need
    with a simple twist of the jet face.  Whether you are looking for a powerful, invigorating massage or a deep relaxation,
    with our exclusive massage insert technology you can choose the width of spray, intensity and direction of massage.
    Our interchangeable flexible massage inserts let you select the exact number of jet you want, from 46 jets in our lowest
    price model 321, up to 168 jets available in our executive 750 model.  How many jets do you want?  What sort of massage do you
    want?  What type of water pressure do you like?  With Beachcomber's 30 day in home "Customer Promise", you have the ability
    to try your hot tub at home for 30 days and then exchange or pick the jet numbers and type of massage you want for free.</p>

    <h3>How ClearTech&trade; Works</h3>

    <p>As the hot tub water passes through the stainless steel unit, the water is exposed to a
    specialized, intense UV Lamp. On the beach, UV light can burn your skin; but in this chamber, directed high intensity UV light
    eliminates 99.9 % of bacteria, viruses and pathogens on contact within one to three seconds. As the water passes through, harmful organisms
    exposed to the lamp are sterilized. This powerful UV light also destroys chloramines, which creates the familiar, unpleasant odour and smell often
    found in swimming pools and hot tubs.</p>
