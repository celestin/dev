    <p class="desc">The practise of soaking in warm water is centuries old.
    Many cultures including the Romans used the many benefits
    of warm water to heal body and mind.  It provided the
    setting for communication and reflection.</p>

    <p class="desc">In ancient Babylon the word for <i>Doctor</i> was &quot;<i>one who knows water</i>&quot;.</p>

    <p class="desc">Like the oceans with daily tides up and down, we also have our daily up and downs,
    called <b>stress</b> and <b>relaxation</b>.</p>

    <p class="desc">Change your daily rhythm from stress to relaxation.  Sink into sensory heaven.</p>
