      <a name="T0000001"><b>A -</b> Alpha, the first letter of
      the Greek alphabet, as Omega is the last. These letters
      occur in the text of Rev. 1:8,11; 21:6; 22:13, and are
      represented by &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Omega&quot;
      respectively (omitted in R.V., 1:11). They mean &quot;the
      first and last.&quot; (Comp. Heb. 12:2; Isa. 41:4; 44:6;
      Rev. 1:11,17; 2:8.) In the symbols of the early Christian
      Church these two letters are frequently combined with the
      cross or with Christ&#39;s monogram to denote his
      divinity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000002"><b>Aaron -</b> the eldest son of Amram
      and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi (Ex. 6:20). Some explain
      the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of
      strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years
      before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his
      sister Miriam (2:1,4; 7:7). He married Elisheba, the
      daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (6:23; 1 Chr.
      2:10), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar
      and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael
      out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God (Ex. 4:14,27-30)
      to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate
      with him in all that they were required to do in bringing
      about the Exodus. He was to be the &quot;mouth&quot; or
      &quot;prophet&quot; of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him,
      because he was a man of a ready utterance (7:1,2,9,10,19).
      He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his
      interviews with Pharaoh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with
      Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the
      scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his
      outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by
      Aaron and Hur, his sister&#39;s husband, who held up his
      wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel
      gained the victory (17:8-13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at
      the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables
      of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along
      with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to
      accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the
      manifestation of the glory of Israel&#39;s God (Ex. 19:24;
      24:9-11). While Moses remained on the mountain with God,
      Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear,
      or ignorance, or instability of character, to their
      clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an
      object of worship (Ex. 32:4; Ps. 106:19). On the return of
      Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the
      part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him
      before God, who forgave his sin (Deut. 9:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the
      system of worship which was to be set up among the people;
      and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were
      consecrated to the priest&#39;s office (Lev. 8; 9). Aaron,
      as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place
      appertaining to that office.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in &quot;the wilderness
      of Paran,&quot; Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in
      murmuring against Moses, &quot;because of the Ethiopian
      woman whom he had married,&quot; probably after the death
      of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and
      punished Miriam with leprosy (Num. 12). Aaron acknowledged
      his own and his sister&#39;s guilt, and at the intercession
      of Moses they were forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were
      encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and
      Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful
      judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed,
      and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a
      fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by
      the interposition of Aaron (Num. 16). That there might be
      further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the
      priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each
      required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of
      his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the
      tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle,
      and in the morning it was found that while the other rods
      remained unchanged, that of Aaron &quot;for the house of
      Levi&quot; budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds (Num.
      17:1-10). This rod was afterwards preserved in the
      tabernacle (Heb. 9:4) as a memorial of the divine
      attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah
      (Num. 20:8-13), and on that account was not permitted to
      enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount
      Hor, &quot;in the edge of the land of Edom,&quot; at the
      command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the
      top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There
      he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them
      upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount,
      being 123 years old (Num. 20:23-29. Comp. Deut. 10:6;
      32:50), and was &quot;gathered unto his people.&quot; The
      people, &quot;even all the house of Israel,&quot; mourned
      for him thirty days. Of Aaron&#39;s sons two survived him,
      Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the
      time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with
      Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon.
      Aaron&#39;s other two sons had been struck dead (Lev.
      10:1,2) for the daring impiety of offering &quot;strange
      fire&quot; on the alter of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site
      of Aaron&#39;s grave on one of the two summits of Mount
      Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is
      mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings
      of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first anointed priest. His descendants,
      &quot;the house of Aaron,&quot; constituted the priesthood
      in general. In the time of David they were very numerous (1
      Chr. 12:27). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held
      subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office.
      Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the
      high priest. His priesthood was a &quot;shadow of heavenly
      things,&quot; and was intended to lead the people of Israel
      to look forward to the time when &quot;another priest&quot;
      would arise &quot;after the order of Melchizedek&quot;
      (Heb. 6:20). (See <a href=

      MOSES</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000003"><b>Aaronites -</b> the descendants of
      Aaron, and therefore priests. Jehoiada, the father of
      Benaiah, led 3,700 Aaronites as &quot;fighting men&quot; to
      the support of David at Hebron (1 Chr. 12:27). Eleazar
      (Num. 3:32), and at a later period Zadok (1 Chr. 27:17),
      was their chief.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000004"><b>Abaddon -</b> destruction, the Hebrew
      name (equivalent to the Greek Apollyon, i.e., destroyer) of
      &quot;the angel of the bottomless pit&quot; (Rev. 9:11). It
      is rendered &quot;destruction&quot; in Job 28:22; 31:12;
      26:6; Prov. 15:11; 27:20. In the last three of these
      passages the Revised Version retains the word
      &quot;Abaddon.&quot; We may regard this word as a
      personification of the idea of destruction, or as sheol,
      the realm of the dead.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000005"><b>Abagtha -</b> one of the seven
      eunuchs in Ahasuerus&#39;s court (Esther 1:10; 2:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000006"><b>Abana -</b> stony (Heb. marg.
      &quot;Amanah,&quot; perennial), the chief river of Damascus
      (2 Kings 5:12). Its modern name is Barada, the
      Chrysorrhoas, or &quot;golden stream,&quot; of the Greeks.
      It rises in a cleft of the Anti-Lebanon range, about 23
      miles north-west of Damascus, and after flowing southward
      for a little way parts into three smaller streams, the
      central one flowing through Damascus, and the other two on
      each side of the city, diffusing beauty and fertility where
      otherwise there would be barrenness.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000007"><b>Abarim -</b> regions beyond; i.e., on
      the east of Jordan, a mountain, or rather a mountain-chain,
      over against Jericho, to the east and south-east of the
      Dead Sea, in the land of Moab. From &quot;the top of
      Pisgah&quot;, i.e., Mount Nebo (q.v.), one of its summits,
      Moses surveyed the Promised Land (Deut. 3:27; 32:49), and
      there he died (34:1,5). The Israelites had one of their
      encampments in the mountains of Abarim (Num. 33:47,48)
      after crossing the Arnon.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000008"><b>Abba -</b> This Syriac or Chaldee
      word is found three times in the New Testament (Mark 14:36;
      Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6), and in each case is followed by its
      Greek equivalent, which is translated &quot;father.&quot;
      It is a term expressing warm affection and filial
      confidence. It has no perfect equivalent in our language.
      It has passed into European languages as an ecclesiastical
      term, &quot;abbot.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000009"><b>Abda -</b> servant. (1.) The father
      of Adoniram, whom Solomon set over the tribute (1 Kings
      4:6); i.e., the forced labour (R.V., &quot;levy&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite of the family of Jeduthun (Neh. 11:17), also
      called Obadiah (1 Chr. 9:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000010"><b>Abdeel -</b> servant of God, (Jer.
      36:26), the father of Shelemiah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000011"><b>Abdi -</b> my servant. (1.) 1 Chr.
      6:44. (2.) 2 Chr. 29:12. (3.) Ezra 10:26.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000012"><b>Abdiel -</b> servant of God, (1 Chr.
      5:15), a Gadite chief.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000013"><b>Abdon -</b> servile. (1.) The son of
      Hillel, a Pirathonite, the tenth judge of Israel (Judg.
      12:13-15). He is probably the Bedan of 1 Sam. 12:11.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The first-born of Gibeon of the tribe of Benjamin (1
      Chr. 8:30; 9:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The son of Micah, one of those whom Josiah sent to the
      prophetess Huldah to ascertain from her the meaning of the
      recently discovered book of the law (2 Chr. 34:20). He is
      called Achbor in 2 Kings 22:12.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) One of the &quot;sons&quot; of Shashak (1 Chr. 8:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the name also of a Levitical town of the
      Gershonites, in the tribe of Asher (Josh. 21:30; 1 Chr.
      6:74). The ruins of Abdeh, some 8 miles north-east of
      Accho, probably mark its site.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000014"><b>Abednego -</b> servant of Nego=Nebo,
      the Chaldee name given to Azariah, one of Daniel&#39;s
      three companions (Dan. 2:49). With Shadrach and Meshach, he
      was delivered from the burning fiery furnace (3:12-30).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000015"><b>Abel -</b> (Heb. Hebhel), a breath,
      or vanity, the second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to
      death by his brother Cain (Gen. 4:1-16). Guided by the
      instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained
      in the duty of worshipping God. &quot;And in process of
      time&quot; (marg. &quot;at the end of days&quot;, i.e., on
      the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the
      first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered
      the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the
      firstlings of his flock. &quot;The Lord had respect unto
      Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he
      had not respect&quot; (Gen. 4:3-5). On this account Cain
      was angry with his brother, and formed the design of
      putting him to death; a design which he at length found an
      opportunity of carrying into effect (Gen. 4:8,9. Comp. 1
      John 3:12). There are several references to Abel in the New
      Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as
      &quot;righteous&quot; (Matt. 23:35). &quot;The blood of
      sprinkling&quot; is said to speak &quot;better things than
      that of Abel&quot; (Heb. 12:24); i.e., the blood of Jesus
      is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by
      Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the
      sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and
      not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the
      blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has
      sometimes been supposed. It is also said (Heb. 11:4) that
      &quot;Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
      Cain.&quot; This sacrifice was made &quot;by faith;&quot;
      this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the
      God of providence, but especially in God as the great
      Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices
      which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered
      from the days of Adam downward. On account of that
      &quot;faith&quot; which looked forward to the great atoning
      sacrifice, Abel&#39;s offering was accepted of God.
      Cain&#39;s offering had no such reference, and therefore
      was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the
      first of our race to die.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel (Heb. &#39;abhel), lamentation (1 Sam. 6:18), the name
      given to the great stone in Joshua&#39;s field whereon the
      ark was &quot;set down.&quot; The Revised Version, however,
      following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text
      <i>&#39;ebhen</i> (= a stone), and accordingly translates
      &quot;unto the great stone, whereon they set down the
      ark.&quot; This reading is to be preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel (Heb. &#39;abhel), a grassy place, a meadow. This word
      enters into the composition of the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000016"><b>Abel-beth-maachah -</b> meadow of the
      house of Maachah, a city in the north of Palestine, in the
      neighbourhood of Dan and Ijon, in the tribe of Naphtali. It
      was a place of considerable strength and importance. It is
      called a &quot;mother in Israel&quot;, i.e., a metropolis
      (2 Sam. 20:19). It was besieged by Joab (2 Sam. 20:14), by
      Benhadad (1 Kings 15:20), and by Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings
      15:29) about B.C. 734. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim,
      meadow of the waters, (2 Chr. 16:4). Its site is occupied
      by the modern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to
      the east of the brook Derdarah, which flows through the
      plain of Huleh into the Jordan, about 6 miles to the
      west-north-west of Dan.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000017"><b>Abel-cheramim -</b> (Judg. 11:33,
      R.V.; A. V., &quot;plain of the vineyards&quot;), a village
      of the Ammonites, whither Jephthah pursued their
      forces.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000018"><b>Abel-meholah -</b> meadow of dancing,
      or the dancing-meadow, the birth-place and residence of the
      prophet Elisha, not far from Beth-shean (1 Kings 4:12), in
      the tribe of Issachar, near where the Wady el-Maleh emerges
      into the valley of the Jordan, &quot;the rich meadow-land
      which extends about 4 miles south of Beth-shean; moist and
      luxuriant.&quot; Here Elisha was found at his plough by
      Elijah on his return up the Jordan valley from Horeb (1
      Kings 19:16). It is now called &#39;Ain Helweh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000019"><b>Abel-mizraim -</b> meadow of Egypt,
      or mourning of Egypt, a place &quot;beyond,&quot; i.e., on
      the west of Jordan, at the &quot;threshing-floor of
      Atad.&quot; Here the Egyptians mourned seventy days for
      Jacob (Gen. 50:4-11). Its site is unknown.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000020"><b>Abel-shittim -</b> meadow of the
      acacias, frequently called simply &quot;Shittim&quot; (Num.
      25:1; Josh. 2:1; Micah 6:5), a place on the east of Jordan,
      in the plain of Moab, nearly opposite Jericho. It was the
      forty-second encampment of the Israelites, their last
      resting-place before they crossed the Jordan (Num. 33:49;
      22:1; 26:3; 31:12; comp. 25:1; 31:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000021"><b>Abez -</b> tin, or white, a town in

      <a name="T0000025"><b>Abiathar -</b> father of abundance,
      or my father excels, the son of Ahimelech the high priest.
      He was the tenth high priest, and the fourth in descent
      from Eli. When his father was slain with the priests of
      Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joined
      David, who was then in the cave of Adullam (1 Sam.
      22:20-23; 23:6). He remained with David, and became priest
      of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). When
      David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed
      high priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the
      &quot;king&#39;s companion&quot; (1 Chr. 27:34). Meanwhile
      Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest.
      These appointments continued in force till the end of
      David&#39;s reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the
      sole historical instance of the deposition of a high
      priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon,
      because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to
      the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of
      Ithamar (1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). Zadok now
      became sole high priest. In Mark 2:26, reference is made to
      an occurrence in &quot;the days of Abiathar the high
      priest.&quot; But from 1 Sam. 22, we learn explicitly that
      this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of
      Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is
      satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark
      as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the
      term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not
      implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time
      referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves
      belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time (Lev. 24:9) a
      priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or
      persuaded his father to give them.</a>

      year. It began about the time of the vernal equinox, on
      21st March. It was called Nisan, after the Captivity (Neh.
      2:1). On the fifteenth day of the month, harvest was begun

      and delicate management at a critical period of her
      husband&#39;s life. She was &quot;a woman of good
      understanding, and of a beautiful countenance.&quot; After
      Nabal&#39;s death she became the wife of David (1 Sam.

      his three brothers he was consecrated to the priest&#39;s
      office (Ex. 28:1). With his father and elder brother he
      accompanied the seventy elders part of the way up the mount
      with Moses (Ex. 24:1,9). On one occasion he and Nadab his
      brother offered incense in their censers filled with
      &quot;strange&quot; (i.e., common) fire, i.e., not with
      fire taken from the great brazen altar (Lev. 6:9, etc.),
      and for this offence they were struck dead, and were taken
      out and buried without the camp (Lev. 10:1-11; comp. Num.
      3:4; 26:61; 1 Chr. 24:2). It is probable that when they
      committed this offence they were intoxicated, for
      immediately after is given the law prohibiting the use of

    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The second son of Samuel (1 Sam. 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28).
      His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in
      Beer-sheba, to which office his father had appointed him,
      led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the
      people to demand a royal form of government.

    <p>
      (4.) A descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, a chief of
      one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was
      divided by David (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah was
      one of those which did not return from the Captivity (Ezra
      2:36-39; Neh. 7:39-42; 12:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The son of Rehoboam, whom he succeeded on the throne
      of Judah (1 Chr. 3:10). He is also called Abijam (1 Kings
      14:31; 15:1-8). He began his three years&#39; reign (2 Chr.
      12:16; 13:1,2) with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort to
      bring back the ten tribes to their allegiance. His address
      to &quot;Jeroboam and all Israel,&quot; before encountering
      them in battle, is worthy of being specially noticed (2
      Chr. 13:5-12). It was a very bloody battle, no fewer than
      500,000 of the army of Israel having perished on the field.
      He is described as having walked &quot;in all the sins of
      his father&quot; (1 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 11:20-22). It is
      said in 1 Kings 15:2 that &quot;his mother&#39;s name was
      Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom;&quot; but in 2 Chr.
      13:2 we read, &quot;his mother&#39;s name was Michaiah, the
      daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.&quot; The explanation is that
      Maachah is just a variation of the name Michaiah, and that
      Abishalom is probably the same as Absalom, the son of
      David. It is probable that &quot;Uriel of Gibeah&quot;
      married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom (2 Sam. 14:27), and
      by her had Maachah. The word &quot;daughter&quot; in 1
      Kings 15:2 will thus, as it frequently elsewhere does, mean
      grand-daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) A son of Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. On
      account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent
      his wife to consult the prophet Ahijah regarding his
      recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the
      wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a
      divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in
      Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found
      &quot;some good thing toward the Lord,&quot; he only would
      come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the
      threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and
      &quot;all Israel mourned for him&quot; (1 Kings 14:1-18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) The daughter of Zechariah (2 Chr. 29:1; comp. Isa.

      in the Suk Wady Barada, between Heliopolis (Baalbec) and

      father of a king, a common name of the Philistine kings, as
      &quot;Pharaoh&quot; was of the Egyptian kings. (1.) The
      Philistine king of Gerar in the time of Abraham (Gen.
      20:1-18). By an interposition of Providence, Sarah was
      delivered from his harem, and was restored to her husband
      Abraham. As a mark of respect he gave to Abraham valuable
      gifts, and offered him a settlement in any part of his
      country; while at the same time he delicately and yet
      severely rebuked him for having practised a deception upon
      him in pretending that Sarah was only his sister. Among the
      gifts presented by the king were a thousand pieces of
      silver as a &quot;covering of the eyes&quot; for Sarah;
      i.e., either as an atoning gift and a testimony of her
      innocence in the sight of all, or rather for the purpose of
      procuring a veil for Sarah to conceal her beauty, and thus
      as a reproof to her for not having worn a veil which, as a
      married woman, she ought to have done. A few years after
      this Abimelech visited Abraham, who had removed southward
      beyond his territory, and there entered into a league of
      peace and friendship with him. This league was the first of
      which we have any record. It was confirmed by a mutual oath
      at Beer-sheba (Gen. 21:22-34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A king of Gerar in the time of Isaac, probably the son
      of the preceeding (Gen. 26:1-22). Isaac sought refuge in
      his territory during a famine, and there he acted a part
      with reference to his wife Rebekah similar to that of his
      father Abraham with reference to Sarah. Abimelech rebuked
      him for the deception, which he accidentally discovered.
      Isaac settled for a while here, and prospered. Abimelech
      desired him, however, to leave his territory, which Isaac
      did. Abimelech afterwards visited him when he was encamped
      at Beer-sheba, and expressed a desire to renew the covenant
      which had been entered into between their fathers (Gen.
      26:26-31).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A son of Gideon (Judg. 9:1), who was proclaimed king
      after the death of his father (Judg. 8:33-9:6). One of his
      first acts was to murder his brothers, seventy in number,
      &quot;on one stone,&quot; at Ophrah. Only one named Jotham
      escaped. He was an unprincipled, ambitious ruler, often
      engaged in war with his own subjects. When engaged in
      reducing the town of Thebez, which had revolted, he was
      struck mortally on his head by a mill-stone, thrown by the
      hand of a woman from the wall above. Perceiving that the
      wound was mortal, he desired his armour-bearer to thrust
      him through with his sword, that it might not be said he
      had perished by the hand of a woman (Judg. 9:50-57).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The son of Abiathar, and high priest in the time of
      David (1 Chr. 18:16). In the parallel passage, 2 Sam. 8:17,
      we have the name Ahimelech, and Abiathar, the son of
      Ahimelech. This most authorities consider the more correct
      reading. (5.) Achish, king of Gath, in the title of Ps. 34.

      <a name="T0000051"><b>Ablution -</b> or washing, was
      practised, (1.) When a person was initiated into a higher
      state: e.g., when Aaron and his sons were set apart to the
      priest&#39;s office, they were washed with water previous
      to their investiture with the priestly robes (Lev.
      8:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Before the priests approached the altar of God, they
      were required, on pain of death, to wash their hands and
      their feet to cleanse them from the soil of common life
      (Ex. 30:17-21). To this practice the Psalmist alludes, Ps.
      26:6.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) There were washings prescribed for the purpose of
      cleansing from positive defilement contracted by particular
      acts. Of such washings eleven different species are
      prescribed in the Levitical law (Lev. 12-15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A fourth class of ablutions is mentioned, by which a
      person purified or absolved himself from the guilt of some
      particular act. For example, the elders of the nearest
      village where some murder was committed were required, when
      the murderer was unknown, to wash their hands over the
      expiatory heifer which was beheaded, and in doing so to
      say, &quot;Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have
      our eyes seen it&quot; (Deut. 21:1-9). So also Pilate
      declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus by washing
      his hands (Matt. 27:24). This act of Pilate may not,
      however, have been borrowed from the custom of the Jews.
      The same practice was common among the Greeks and Romans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pharisees carried the practice of ablution to great
      excess, thereby claiming extraordinary purity (Matt.
      23:25). Mark (7:1-5) refers to the ceremonial ablutions.
      The Pharisees washed their hands &quot;oft,&quot; more
      correctly, &quot;with the fist&quot; (R.V.,
      &quot;diligently&quot;), or as an old father, Theophylact,
      explains it, &quot;up to the elbow.&quot; (Compare also

      <a name="T0000052"><b>Abner -</b> father of light; i.e.,
      &quot;enlightening&quot;, the son of Ner and uncle of Saul.
      He was commander-in-chief of Saul&#39;s army (1 Sam. 14:50;
      17:55; 20:25). He first introduced David to the court of
      Saul after the victory over Goliath (1 Sam. 17:57). After
      the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and
      reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a
      feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of
      Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the
      house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be
      proclaimed king (2 Sam. 2:8). A state of war existed
      between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was
      the leader of Ish-boseth&#39;s army, was fought with
      David&#39;s army under Joab at Gibeon (2 Sam. 2:12). Abner,
      escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was
      &quot;light of foot as a wild roe,&quot; the brother of
      Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke
      of his spear (2 Sam. 2: 18-32).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking
      to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he
      found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom
      he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign
      over all Israel. David received him favourably, and
      promised that he would have command of the armies. At this
      time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he
      found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but
      Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the
      gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his
      sword (2 Sam. 3:27, 31-39; 4:12. Comp. 1 Kings 2:5, 32).
      David lamented in pathetic words the death of Abner,
      &quot;Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man
      fallen this day in Israel?&quot; (2 Sam. 3:33-38.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000053"><b>Abomination -</b> This word is used,
      (1.) To express the idea that the Egyptians considered
      themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers (Gen.
      43:32). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice,
      holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners (John
      18:28; Acts 10:28; 11:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Every shepherd was &quot;an abomination&quot; unto the
      Egyptians (Gen. 46:34). This aversion to shepherds, such as
      the Hebrews, arose probably from the fact that Lower and
      Middle Egypt had formerly been held in oppressive
      subjection by a tribe of nomad shepherds (the Hyksos), who
      had only recently been expelled, and partly also perhaps
      from this other fact that the Egyptians detested the
      lawless habits of these wandering shepherds.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Pharaoh was so moved by the fourth plague, that while
      he refused the demand of Moses, he offered a compromise,
      granting to the Israelites permission to hold their
      festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This
      permission could not be accepted, because Moses said they
      would have to sacrifice &quot;the abomination of the
      Egyptians&quot; (Ex. 8:26); i.e., the cow or ox, which all
      the Egyptians held as sacred, and which they regarded it as
      sacrilegious to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Daniel (11:31), in that section of his prophecies
      which is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful
      calamities that were to fall on the Jews in the time of
      Antiochus Epiphanes, says, &quot;And they shall place the
      abomination that maketh desolate.&quot; Antiochus Epiphanes
      caused an altar to be erected on the altar of
      burnt-offering, on which sacrifices were offered to Jupiter
      Olympus. (Comp. 1 Macc. 1:57). This was the abomination of
      the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language is employed
      in Dan. 9:27 (comp. Matt. 24:15), where the reference is
      probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans
      set up at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to
      which they paid idolatrous honours. &quot;Almost the entire
      religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the
      ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the
      ensign before all other gods.&quot; These ensigns were an
      &quot;abomination&quot; to the Jews, the &quot;abomination
      of desolation.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is also used symbolically of sin in general (Isa.
      66:3); an idol (44:19); the ceremonies of the apostate
      Church of Rome (Rev. 17:4); a detestable act (Ezek. 22:11).

      <a name="T0000054"><b>Abraham -</b> father of a multitude,
      son of Terah, named (Gen. 11:27) before his older brothers
      Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises.
      Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred
      in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father
      and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in
      which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north
      to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his
      migration was a call from God (Acts 7:2-4). There is no
      mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is
      implied, however, in Gen. 12. While they tarried at Haran,
      Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a
      second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise
      from God (Gen. 12:1,2); whereupon he took his departure,
      taking his nephew Lot with him, &quot;not knowing whither
      he went&quot; (Heb. 11:8). He trusted implicitly to the
      guidance of Him who had called him.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand
      souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents.
      Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of
      Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem (Gen.
      12:6), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on
      the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the
      great promise, &quot;I will make of thee a great
      nation,&quot; etc. (Gen. 12:2,3,7). This promise
      comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual
      blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of
      the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago
      predicted (Gen. 3:15). Soon after this, for some reason not
      mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district
      between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two
      miles apart, where he built an altar to
      &quot;Jehovah.&quot; He again moved into the southern tract
      of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at
      length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into
      Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic
      race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred
      that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed
      him to the rebuke of Pharaoh (Gen. 12:18). Sarai was
      restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents,
      recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned
      to Canaan richer than when he left it, &quot;in cattle, in
      silver, and in gold&quot; (Gen. 12:8; 13:2. Comp. Ps.
      105:13, 14). The whole party then moved northward, and
      returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here
      disputes arose between Lot&#39;s shepherds and those of
      Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot
      his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp. 1 Cor. 6:7.) He
      chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated,
      and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were
      separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a
      repetition of the promises already made to him, and then
      removed to the plain or &quot;oak-grove&quot; of Mamre,
      which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his
      tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called &quot;the
      oak of Mamre&quot; (Gen. 13:18). This was his third
      resting-place in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in
      Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King
      of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities
      in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was
      felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy
      burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought
      upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league
      with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country,
      plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as
      slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the
      disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately
      gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men,
      and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and
      Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him
      near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed
      his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as
      far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing
      back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning
      by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place,
      Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To
      him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition
      of his character as a priest of the most high God (Gen.
      14:18-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the
      grandfather of Amraphel (Gen. 14:1), one of the witnesses
      is called &quot;the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,&quot; or
      Abram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already
      made to him by God were repeated and enlarged (Gen. 13:14).
      &quot;The word of the Lord&quot; (an expression occurring
      here for the first time) &quot;came to him&quot; (15:1). He
      now understood better the future that lay before the nation
      that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years
      old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her
      Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever
      child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael
      was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the
      heir of these promises (Gen. 16). When Ishmael was thirteen
      years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully
      his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment
      of that purpose the patriarch&#39;s name was now changed
      from Abram to Abraham (Gen. 17:4,5), and the rite of
      circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It
      was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises
      would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years
      old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At
      the same time, in commemoration of the promises,
      Sarai&#39;s name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable
      day of God&#39;s thus revealing his design, Abraham and his
      son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised
      (Gen. 17). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his
      tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his
      proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree,
      partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One
      of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and
      the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord
      renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who
      was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three
      as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on
      toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with
      Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about
      to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded
      earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten
      righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city
      would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell
      upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of
      the fire that consumed it as the &quot;smoke of a
      furnace&quot; (Gen. 19:1-28).
    </p>
    <p>
      After fifteen years&#39; residence at Mamre, Abraham moved
      southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near
      to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication
      on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King (Gen.
      20). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000000.html&amp;from=T0000040&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      ABIMELECH</a>.) Soon after this event, the patriarch left
      the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley
      about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that
      Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A
      feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar,
      whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as
      Abraham&#39;s heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her
      son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a
      hard trial to Abraham (Gen. 21:12). (See HAGAR
      &macr;T0001583; <a href=

      ISHMAEL</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point there is a blank in the patriarch&#39;s
      history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace
      and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we
      see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command
      that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the
      heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the
      mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test (Heb.
      11:17-19). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating
      obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay
      his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand
      was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was
      entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered
      in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called
      Jehovah-jireh, i.e., &quot;The Lord will provide.&quot; The
      promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was
      the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he
      descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home
      at Beer-sheba (Gen. 22:19), where he resided for some
      years, and then moved northward to Hebron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years
      old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a
      burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the
      owner of it, Ephron the Hittite (Gen. 23); and there he
      buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for
      Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer,
      to Haran (or Charran, Acts 7:2), where his brother Nahor
      and his family resided (Gen. 11:31). The result was that
      Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor&#39;s son Bethuel, became
      the wife of Isaac (Gen. 24). Abraham then himself took to
      wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose
      descendants were afterwards known as the &quot;children of
      the east&quot; (Judg. 6:3), and later as
      &quot;Saracens.&quot; At length all his wanderings came to
      an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had
      first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried
      in the old family burying-place at Machpelah (Gen.
      25:7-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on
      the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in
      the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He
      is called &quot;the friend of God&quot; (James 2:23),
      &quot;faithful Abraham&quot; (Gal. 3:9), &quot;the father
      of us all&quot; (Rom. 4:16).

      &quot;peaceful&quot; David&#39;s son by Maacah (2 Sam. 3:3;
      comp. 1 Kings 1:6). He was noted for his personal beauty
      and for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his
      head (2 Sam. 14:25,26). The first public act of his life
      was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon,
      David&#39;s eldest son, who had basely wronged
      Absalom&#39;s sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at
      the time of the festivities connected with a great
      sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David&#39;s other sons fled
      from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the
      death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences
      of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and
      there abode for three years (2 Sam. 3:3; 13:23-38).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of
      fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a
      woman of Tekoah, Joab received David&#39;s sanction to
      invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly,
      but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into
      his presence (2 Sam. 14:28). Absalom was now probably the
      oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal
      descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to
      aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the
      people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after
      his return from Geshur (2 Sam. 15:7; marg., R.V.) he went
      up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great
      body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The
      revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to
      quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where
      upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of
      the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been
      David&#39;s chief counsellor, deserted him and joined
      Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also
      joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to
      counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage
      David&#39;s cause. He was so far successful that by his
      advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom
      delayed to march an army against his father, who thus
      gained time to prepare for the defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose
      army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the
      borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of
      Absalom&#39;s army were slain in that fatal battle, and the
      rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long
      flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the
      bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab
      came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body
      was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest,
      and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the
      tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David,
      as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was
      told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter
      lamentation: &quot;O my son Absalom, my son, my son
      Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
      my son!&quot; (2 Sam. 18:33. Comp. Ex. 32:32; Rom. 9:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom&#39;s three sons (2 Sam. 14:27; comp. 18:18) had
      all died before him, so that he left only a daughter,
      Tamar, who became the grandmother of Abijah.

      R.V. probably the Acacia seyal (the gum-arabic tree);
      called the &quot;shittah&quot; tree (Isa. 41:19). Its wood
      is called shittim wood (Ex. 26:15,26; 25:10,13,23,28,
      etc.). This species (A. seyal) is like the hawthorn, a
      gnarled and thorny tree. It yields the gum-arabic of
      commerce. It is found in abundance in the Sinaitic
      peninsula.</a>

      <a name="T0000060"><b>Accad -</b> the high land or
      mountains, a city in the land of Shinar. It has been
      identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to
      the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of
      the cities of Nimrod&#39;s kingdom (Ge 10:10). It stood
      close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003200.html&amp;from=T0003277&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      SEPHARVAIM</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also the name of the country of which this city was
      the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The
      Accadians who came from the &quot;mountains of the
      east,&quot; where the ark rested, attained to a high degree
      of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are
      called &quot;the black heads&quot; and &quot;the black
      faces,&quot; in contrast to &quot;the white race&quot; of
      Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in
      pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in
      which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on
      clay. The Semitic Babylonians (&quot;the white race&quot;),
      or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and
      afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded
      and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language
      ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of
      its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the
      educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the
      Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research
      consists of interlinear or parallel translations from
      Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten
      language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the
      class of languages called agglutinative, common to the
      Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words &quot;glued
      together,&quot; without declension of conjugation. These
      tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history.
      Among other notable records, they contain an account of the
      Creation which closely resembles that given in the book of
      Genesis, of the Sabbath as a day of rest, and of the Deluge
      and its cause. (See BABYLON &macr;T0000409; <a href=

      <a name="T0000061"><b>Accho -</b> sultry or sandy, a town
      and harbour of Phoenicia, in the tribe of Asher, but never
      acquired by them (Judg. 1:31). It was known to the ancient
      Greeks and Romans by the name of Ptolemais, from Ptolemy
      the king of Egypt, who rebuilt it about B.C. 100. Here Paul
      landed on his last journey to Jerusalem (Acts 21:7). During
      the crusades of the Middle Ages it was called Acra; and
      subsequently, on account of its being occupied by the
      Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem, it was called St. Jean
      d&#39;Acre, or simply Acre.</a>

      <a name="T0000062"><b>Accuser -</b> Satan is styled the
      &quot;accuser of the brethren&quot; (Rev. 12:10. Comp. Job
      1:6; Zech. 3:1), as seeking to uphold his influence among
      men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the
      view of weakening their influence and injuring the cause
      with which they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews
      as the accuser of men before God, laying to their charge
      the violations of the law of which they were guilty, and
      demanding their punishment. The same Greek word, rendered
      &quot;accuser,&quot; is found in John 8:10 (but omitted in
      the Revised Version); Acts 23:30, 35; 24:8; 25:16, 18, in
      all of which places it is used of one who brings a charge
      against another.</a>

      <a name="T0000063"><b>Aceldama -</b> the name which the
      Jews gave in their proper tongue, i.e., in Aramaic, to the
      field which was purchased with the money which had been
      given to the betrayer of our Lord. The word means
      &quot;field of blood.&quot; It was previously called
      &quot;the potter&#39;s field&quot; (Matt. 27:7, 8; Acts
      1:19), and was appropriated as the burial-place for
      strangers. It lies on a narrow level terrace on the south
      face of the valley of Hinnom. Its modern name is Hak
      ed-damm.</a>

      <a name="T0000064"><b>Achaia -</b> the name originally of a
      narrow strip of territory in Greece, on the north-west of
      the Peloponnesus. Subsequently it was applied by the Romans
      to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the
      south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces
      (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the
      country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this
      latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the
      New Testament (Acts 18:12, 27; 19:21; Rom. 15: 26; 16:5,
      etc.). It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the
      Apostles under the proconsular form of government; hence
      the appropriate title given to Gallio as the
      &quot;deputy,&quot; i.e., proconsul, of Achaia (Acts
      18:12).</a>

      <a name="T0000065"><b>Achaichus -</b> (1 Cor. 16:17), one
      of the members of the church of Corinth who, with
      Fortunatus and Stephanas, visited Paul while he was at
      Ephesus, for the purpose of consulting him on the affairs
      of the church. These three probably were the bearers of the
      letter from Corinth to the apostle to which he alludes in 1
      Cor. 7:1.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000066"><b>Achan -</b> called also Achar, i.e.,
      one who troubles (1 Chr. 2:7), in commemoration of his
      crime, which brought upon him an awful destruction (Josh.
      7:1). On the occasion of the fall of Jericho, he seized,
      contrary to the divine command, an ingot of gold, a
      quantity of silver, and a costly Babylonish garment, which
      he hid in his tent. Joshua was convinced that the defeat
      which the Israelites afterwards sustained before Ai was a
      proof of the divine displeasure on account of some crime,
      and he at once adopted means by the use of the lot for
      discovering the criminal. It was then found that Achan was
      guilty, and he was stoned to death in the valley of Achor.
      He and all that belonged to him were then consumed by fire,
      and a heap of stones was raised over the ashes.</a>

      Edomitish king (Gen. 36:38; 1 Chr. 1:49).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of Josiah&#39;s officers sent to the prophetess
      Huldah to inquire regarding the newly-discovered book of
      the law (2 Kings 22:12, 14). He is also called Abdon (2
      Chr. 34:20).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000068"><b>Achish -</b> angry, perhaps only a
      general title of royalty applicable to the Philistine
      kings. (1.) The king with whom David sought refuge when he
      fled from Saul (1 Sam. 21:10-15). He is called Abimelech in
      the superscription of Ps. 34. It was probably this same
      king to whom David a second time repaired at the head of a
      band of 600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence
      he carried on war against the surrounding tribes (1 Sam.
      27:5-12). Achish had great confidence in the valour and
      fidelity of David (1 Sam. 28:1,2), but at the instigation
      of his courtiers did not permit him to go up to battle
      along with the Philistine hosts (1 Sam. 29:2-11). David
      remained with Achish a year and four months. (2.) Another
      king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing, to whom
      the two servants of Shimei fled. This led Shimei to go to
      Gath in pursuit of them, and the consequence was that
      Solomon put him to death (1 Kings 2:39-46).</a>

      <a name="T0000069"><b>Achmetha -</b> (Ezra 6:2), called
      Ecbatana by classical writers, the capital of northern
      Media. Here was the palace which was the residence of the
      old Median monarchs, and of Cyrus and Cambyses. In the time
      of Ezra, the Persian kings resided usually at Susa of
      Babylon. But Cyrus held his court at Achmetha; and Ezra,
      writing a century after, correctly mentions the place where
      the decree of Cyrus was found.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000070"><b>Achor -</b> trouble, a valley near
      Jericho, so called in consequence of the trouble which the
      sin of Achan caused Israel (Josh. 7:24,26). The expression
      &quot;valley of Achor&quot; probably became proverbial for
      that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (Isa. 65:10)
      refers to it he uses it in this sense: &quot;The valley of
      Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;&quot; i.e., that
      which had been a source of calamity would become a source
      of blessing. Hosea also (Hos. 2:15) uses the expression in
      the same sense: &quot;The valley of Achor for a door of
      hope;&quot; i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair
      into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady
      Kelt.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000071"><b>Achsah -</b> anklet, Caleb&#39;s only
      daughter (1 Chr. 2:49). She was offered in marriage to the
      man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, or
      Kirjath-sepher. This was done by Othniel (q.v.), who
      accordingly obtained her as his wife (Josh. 15:16-19; Judg.
      1:9-15).</a>

      city of the Canaanites, in the north of Palestine (Josh.
      11:1; 12:20; 19:25). It was in the eastern boundary of the
      tribe of Asher, and is identified with the modern ruined
      village of Kesaf or Yasif, N.E. of Accho.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000073"><b>Achzib -</b> falsehood. (1.) A town
      in the Shephelah, or plain country of Judah (Josh. 15:44);
      probably the same as Chezib of Gen. 38:5 = Ain Kezbeh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Phoenician city (the Gr. Ecdippa), always retained
      in their possession though assigned to the tribe of Asher
      (Josh. 19:29; Judg. 1:31). It is identified with the modern
      es-Zib, on the Mediterranean, about 8 miles north of Accho.

    <p>
      <a name="T0000074"><b>Acre -</b> is the translation of a
      word (tse&#39;med), which properly means a yoke, and
      denotes a space of ground that may be ploughed by a yoke of
      oxen in a day. It is about an acre of our measure (Isa.
      5:10; 1 Sam. 14:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000075"><b>Acts of the Apostles -</b> the title
      now given to the fifth and last of the historical books of
      the New Testament. The author styles it a
      &quot;treatise&quot; (1:1). It was early called &quot;The
      Acts,&quot; &quot;The Gospel of the Holy Ghost,&quot; and
      &quot;The Gospel of the Resurrection.&quot; It contains
      properly no account of any of the apostles except Peter and
      Paul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is
      recorded of James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by
      Herod. It is properly therefore not the history of the
      &quot;Acts of the Apostles,&quot; a title which was given
      to the book at a later date, but of &quot;Acts of
      Apostles,&quot; or more correctly, of &quot;Some Acts of
      Certain Apostles.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards its authorship, it was certainly the work of
      Luke, the &quot;beloved physician&quot; (comp. Luke 1:1-4;
      Acts 1:1). This is the uniform tradition of antiquity,
      although the writer nowhere makes mention of himself by
      name. The style and idiom of the Gospel of Luke and of the
      Acts, and the usage of words and phrases common to both,
      strengthen this opinion. The writer first appears in the
      narrative in 16:11, and then disappears till Paul&#39;s
      return to Philippi two years afterwards, when he and Paul
      left that place together (20:6), and the two seem
      henceforth to have been constant companions to the end. He
      was certainly with Paul at Rome (28; Col. 4:14). Thus he
      wrote a great portion of that history from personal
      observation. For what lay beyond his own experience he had
      the instruction of Paul. If, as is very probable, 2 Tim.
      was written during Paul&#39;s second imprisonment at Rome,
      Luke was with him then as his faithful companion to the
      last (2 Tim. 4:11). Of his subsequent history we have no
      certain information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design of Luke&#39;s Gospel was to give an exhibition
      of the character and work of Christ as seen in his history
      till he was taken up from his disciples into heaven; and of
      the Acts, as its sequel, to give an illustration of the
      power and working of the gospel when preached among all
      nations, &quot;beginning at Jerusalem.&quot; The opening
      sentences of the Acts are just an expansion and an
      explanation of the closing words of the Gospel. In this
      book we have just a continuation of the history of the
      church after Christ&#39;s ascension. Luke here carries on
      the history in the same spirit in which he had commenced
      it. It is only a book of beginnings, a history of the
      founding of churches, the initial steps in the formation of
      the Christian society in the different places visited by
      the apostles. It records a cycle of &quot;representative
      events.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the narrative we see the ever-present,
      all-controlling power of the ever-living Saviour. He
      worketh all and in all in spreading abroad his truth among
      men by his Spirit and through the instrumentality of his
      apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of the writing of this history may be gathered
      from the fact that the narrative extends down to the close
      of the second year of Paul&#39;s first imprisonment at
      Rome. It could not therefore have been written earlier than
      A.D. 61 or 62, nor later than about the end of A.D. 63.
      Paul was probably put to death during his second
      imprisonment, about A.D. 64, or, as some think, 66.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place where the book was written was probably Rome, to
      which Luke accompanied Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to the contents of the book is in 1:8, &quot;Ye
      shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all
      Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
      earth.&quot; After referring to what had been recorded in a
      &quot;former treatise&quot; of the sayings and doings of
      Jesus Christ before his ascension, the author proceeds to
      give an account of the circumstances connected with that
      event, and then records the leading facts with reference to
      the spread and triumphs of Christianity over the world
      during a period of about thirty years. The record begins
      with Pentecost (A.D. 33) and ends with Paul&#39;s first
      imprisonment (A.D. 63 or 64). The whole contents of the
      book may be divided into these three parts:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Chaps. 1-12, describing the first twelve years of the
      Christian church. This section has been entitled &quot;From
      Jerusalem to Antioch.&quot; It contains the history of the
      planting and extension of the church among the Jews by the
      ministry of Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Chaps. 13-21, Paul&#39;s missionary journeys, giving
      the history of the extension and planting of the church
      among the Gentiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Chaps. 21-28, Paul at Rome, and the events which led
      to this. Chaps. 13-28 have been entitled &quot;From Antioch
      to Rome.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this book it is worthy of note that no mention is made
      of the writing by Paul of any of his epistles. This may be
      accounted for by the fact that the writer confined himself
      to a history of the planting of the church, and not to that
      of its training or edification. The relation, however,
      between this history and the epistles of Paul is of such a
      kind, i.e., brings to light so many undesigned

      Jubal (Gen. 4:19, 20, 23).</a>

      (2.) The first of Esau&#39;s three wives, the daughter of

      <a name="T0000077"><b>Adam -</b> red, a Babylonian word,
      the generic name for man, having the same meaning in the
      Hebrew and the Assyrian languages. It was the name given to
      the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history
      and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book
      of Moses (Gen. 1:27-ch. 5). &quot;God created man [Heb.,
      Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him;
      male and female created he them.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was
      formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name),
      and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and
      gave him dominion over all the lower creatures (Gen. 1:26;
      2:7). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of
      Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this
      one prohibition: &quot;Of the tree of the knowledge of good
      and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou
      eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the
      beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God
      brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a
      deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious
      state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again;
      and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him
      when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said,
      &quot;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
      she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
      Man.&quot; He called her Eve, because she was the mother of
      all living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to
      eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also
      did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his
      posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression.
      The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great
      promise of a Deliverer (Gen. 3:15), the &quot;first
      gospel&quot; message to man. They were expelled from Eden,
      and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which
      turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life
      (Gen. 3). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere
      conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her
      first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names
      of only three of Adam&#39;s sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and
      Seth, yet it is obvious that he had several sons and
      daughters (Gen. 5:4). He died aged 930 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race.
      Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity
      of the human race. The investigations of science,
      altogether independent of historical evidence, lead to the
      conclusion that God &quot;hath made of one blood all
      nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the
      earth&quot; (Acts 17:26. Comp. Rom. 5:12-12; 1 Cor.
      15:22-49).

      referred to, but corundum or some kind of hard steel. It is
      an emblem of firmness in resisting adversaries of the truth
      (Zech. 7:12), and of hard-heartedness against the truth
      (Jer. 17:1).</a>

      included the days extending from the new moon of our March
      to the new moon of April. The name was first used after the
      Captivity. When the season was backward, and the lambs not
      yet of a paschal size, or the barley not forward enough for

      We have in the New Testament a striking example of this
      (Matt. 26:63; Mark 5:7), where the high priest calls upon
      Christ to avow his true character. It would seem that in
      such a case the person so adjured could not refuse to give
      an answer.

      to Jerusalem, where his thumbs and great toes were cut off.

      heir-apparent to the throne. But Solomon, a younger
      brother, was preferred to him. Adonijah, however, when his
      father was dying, caused himself to be proclaimed king. But
      Nathan and Bathsheba induced David to give orders that
      Solomon should at once be proclaimed and admitted to the
      throne. Adonijah fled and took refuge at the altar, and
      received pardon for his conduct from Solomon on the
      condition that he showed himself &quot;a worthy man&quot;
      (1 Kings 1:5-53). He afterwards made a second attempt to

      <a name="T0000099"><b>Adoni-zedec -</b> lord of justice or
      righteousness, was king in Jerusalem at the time when the
      Israelites invaded Palestine (Josh. 10:1,3). He formed a
      confederacy with the other Canaanitish kings against the
      Israelites, but was utterly routed by Joshua when he was
      engaged in besieging the Gibeonites. The history of this
      victory and of the treatment of the five confederated kings
      is recorded in Josh. 10:1-27. (Comp. Deut. 21:23). Among
      the Tell Amarna tablets (see EGYPT &macr;T0001137) are some
      very interesting letters from Adoni-zedec to the King of
      Egypt. These illustrate in a very remarkable manner the
      history recorded in Josh. 10, and indeed throw light on the
      wars of conquest generally, so that they may be read as a
      kind of commentary on the book of Joshua. Here the
      conquering career of the Abiri (i.e., Hebrews) is
      graphically described: &quot;Behold, I say that the land of
      the king my lord is ruined&quot;, &quot;The wars are mighty
      against me&quot;, &quot;The Hebrew chiefs plunder all the
      king&#39;s lands&quot;, &quot;Behold, I the chief of the
      Amorites am breaking to pieces.&quot; Then he implores the
      king of Egypt to send soldiers to help him, directing that
      the army should come by sea to Ascalon or Gaza, and thence
      march to Wru-sa-lim (Jerusalem) by the valley of Elah. </a>
