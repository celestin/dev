      <a name="T0000100"><b>Adoption -</b> the giving to any one
      the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son
      by birth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Natural. Thus Pharaoh&#39;s daughter adopted Moses
      (Ex. 2:10), and Mordecai Esther (Esther 2:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) National. God adopted Israel (Ex. 4:22; Deut. 7:6;
      Hos. 11:1; Rom. 9:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Spiritual. An act of God&#39;s grace by which he
      brings men into the number of his redeemed family, and
      makes them partakers of all the blessings he has provided
      for them. Adoption represents the new relations into which
      the believer is introduced by justification, and the
      privileges connected therewith, viz., an interest in
      God&#39;s peculiar love (John 17:23; Rom. 5:5-8), a
      spiritual nature (2 Pet. 1:4; John 1:13), the possession of
      a spirit becoming children of God (1 Pet. 1:14; 2 John 4;
      Rom. 8:15-21; Gal. 5:1; Heb. 2:15), present protection,
      consolation, supplies (Luke 12:27-32; John 14:18; 1 Cor.
      3:21-23; 2 Cor. 1:4), fatherly chastisements (Heb.
      12:5-11), and a future glorious inheritance (Rom. 8:17,23;
      James 2:5; Phil. 3:21).

      ADONIRAM</a>.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000102"><b>Adore -</b> to worship; to express
      reverence and homage. The forms of adoration among the Jews
      were putting off the shoes (Ex. 3:5; Josh. 5:15), and
      prostration (Gen. 17:3; Ps. 95:6; Isa. 44:15, 17, 19;
      46:6). To &quot;kiss the Son&quot; in Ps. 2:12 is to adore
      and worship him. (See Dan. 3:5, 6.) The word itself does
      not occur in Scripture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000103"><b>Adrammelech -</b> Adar the king. (1.)
      An idol; a form of the sun-god worshipped by the
      inhabitants of Sepharvaim (2 Kings 17:31), and brought by
      the Sepharvite colonists into Samaria. (2.) A son of
      Sennacherib, king of Assyria (2 Kings 19:37; Isa.
      37:38).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000104"><b>Adramyttium -</b> a city of Asia
      Minor on the coast of Mysia, which in early times was
      called AEolis. The ship in which Paul embarked at Caesarea
      belonged to this city (Acts 27:2). He was conveyed in it
      only to Myra, in Lycia, whence he sailed in an Alexandrian
      ship to Italy. It was a rare thing for a ship to sail from
      any port of Palestine direct for Italy. It still bears the
      name Adramyti, and is a place of some traffic.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000105"><b>Adria -</b> (Acts 27:27; R.V.,
      &quot;the sea of Adria&quot;), the Adriatic Sea, including
      in Paul&#39;s time the whole of the Mediterranean lying
      between Crete and Sicily. It is the modern Gulf of Venice,
      the <i>Mare Superum_ of the Romans, as distinguished from
      the</i> Mare Inferum_ or Tyrrhenian Sea.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000106"><b>Adriel -</b> flock of God, the son of
      Barzillai, the Meholathite, to whom Saul gave in marriage
      his daughter Merab (1 Sam. 18:19). The five sons that
      sprang from this union were put to death by the Gibeonites
      (2 Sam. 21:8, 9. Here it is said that Michal &quot;brought
      up&quot; [R.V., &quot;bare&quot;] these five sons, either
      that she treated them as if she had been their own mother,
      or that for &quot;Michal&quot; we should read
      &quot;Merab,&quot; as in 1 Sam. 18:19).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000107"><b>Adullam -</b> one of the royal cities
      of the Canaanites, now &#39;Aid-el-ma (Josh. 12:15; 15:35).
      It stood on the old Roman road in the valley of Elah
      (q.v.), which was the scene of David&#39;s memorable
      victory over Goliath (1 Sam. 17:2), and not far from Gath.
      It was one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified against
      Egypt (2 Chr. 11:7). It was called &quot;the glory of
      Israel&quot; (Micah 1:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cave of Adullam has been discovered about 2 miles south
      of the scene of David&#39;s triumph, and about 13 miles
      west from Bethlehem. At this place is a hill some 500 feet
      high pierced with numerous caverns, in one of which David
      gathered together &quot;every one that was in distress, and
      every one that was in debt, and every one that was
      discontented&quot; (1 Sam. 22:2). Some of these caverns are
      large enough to hold 200 or 300 men. According to tradition
      this cave was at Wady Khureitun, between Bethlehem and the
      Dead Sea, but this view cannot be well maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000108"><b>Adullamite -</b> an inhabitant of the
      city of Adullam (Gen. 38:1, 12, 20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000109"><b>Adultery -</b> conjugal infidelity.
      An adulterer was a man who had illicit intercourse with a
      married or a betrothed woman, and such a woman was an
      adulteress. Intercourse between a married man and an
      unmarried woman was fornication. Adultery was regarded as a
      great social wrong, as well as a great sin.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mosaic law (Num. 5:11-31) prescribed that the suspected
      wife should be tried by the ordeal of the &quot;water of
      jealousy.&quot; There is, however, no recorded instance of
      the application of this law. In subsequent times the Rabbis
      made various regulations with the view of discovering the
      guilty party, and of bringing about a divorce. It has been
      inferred from John 8:1-11 that this sin became very common
      during the age preceding the destruction of Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idolatry, covetousness, and apostasy are spoken of as
      adultery spiritually (Jer. 3:6, 8, 9; Ezek. 16:32; Hos.
      1:2:3; Rev. 2:22). An apostate church is an adulteress
      (Isa. 1:21; Ezek. 23:4, 7, 37), and the Jews are styled
      &quot;an adulterous generation&quot; (Matt. 12:39). (Comp.
      Rev. 12.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000110"><b>Adummim -</b> the red ones, a place
      apparently on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem,
      &quot;on the south side of the torrent&quot; Wady Kelt,
      looking toward Gilgal, mentioned Josh. 15:7; 18:17. It was
      nearly half-way between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now
      bears the name of Tal-at-ed-Dumm. It is supposed to have
      been the place referred to in the parable of the Good
      Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37). Recently a new carriage-road has
      been completed, and carriages for the first time have come
      along this road from Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000111"><b>Adversary -</b> (Heb. satan), an
      opponent or foe (1 Kings 5:4; 11:14, 23, 25; Luke 13:17);
      one that speaks against another, a complainant (Matt. 5:25;
      Luke 12:58); an enemy (Luke 18:3), and specially the devil
      (1 Pet. 5:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000112"><b>Advocate -</b> (Gr. parakletos), one
      who pleads another&#39;s cause, who helps another by
      defending or comforting him. It is a name given by Christ
      three times to the Holy Ghost (John 14:16; 15:26; 16:7,
      where the Greek word is rendered &quot;Comforter,&quot;
      q.v.). It is applied to Christ in 1 John 2:1, where the
      same Greek word is rendered &quot;Advocate,&quot; the
      rendering which it should have in all the places where it
      occurs. Tertullus &quot;the orator&quot; (Acts 24:1) was a
      Roman advocate whom the Jews employed to accuse Paul before
      Felix.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000113"><b>AEnon -</b> springs, a place near
      Salim where John baptized (John 3:23). It was probably near
      the upper source of the Wady Far&#39;ah, an open valley
      extending from Mount Ebal to the Jordan. It is full of
      springs. A place has been found called &#39;Ainun, four
      miles north of the springs.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000114"><b>Affection -</b> feeling or emotion.
      Mention is made of &quot;vile affections&quot; (Rom. 1:26)
      and &quot;inordinate affection&quot; (Col. 3:5). Christians
      are exhorted to set their affections on things above (Col.
      3:2). There is a distinction between natural and spiritual
      or gracious affections (Ezek. 33:32).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000115"><b>Affinity -</b> relationship by
      alliance (2 Chr. 18:1) or by marriage (1 Kings 3:1).
      Marriages are prohibited within certain degrees of
      affinity, enumerated Lev. 18:6-17. Consanguinity is
      relationship by blood.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000116"><b>Afflictions -</b> common to all (Job
      5:7; 14:1; Ps. 34:19); are for the good of men (James 1:2,
      3, 12; 2 Cor. 12:7) and the glory of God (2 Cor. 12:7-10; 1
      Pet. 4:14), and are to be borne with patience by the
      Lord&#39;s people (Ps. 94:12; Prov. 3:12). They are all
      directed by God (Lam. 3:33), and will result in the
      everlasting good of his people (2 Cor. 4:16-18) in Christ
      Jesus (Rom. 8:35-39).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000117"><b>Agabus -</b> a &quot;prophet,&quot;
      probably one of the seventy disciples of Christ. He
      prophesied at Antioch of an approaching famine (Acts 11:27,
      28). Many years afterwards he met Paul at Caesarea, and
      warned him of the bonds and affliction that awaited him at
      Jerusalem should he persist in going thither (Acts
      21:10-12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000118"><b>Agag -</b> flame, the usual title of
      the Amalekite kings, as &quot;Pharaoh&quot; was of the
      Egyptian. (1.) A king of the Amalekites referred to by
      Balaam (Num. 24:7). He lived at the time of the Exodus.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another king of the Amalekites whom Saul spared
      unlawfully, but whom Samuel on his arrival in the camp of
      Saul ordered, in retributive justice (Judg. 1), to be
      brought out and cut in pieces (1 Sam. 15:8-33. Comp. Ex.
      17:11; Num. 14:45).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000119"><b>Agagite -</b> a name applied to Haman
      and also to his father (Esther 3:1, 10; 8:3, 5). Probably
      it was equivalent to Amalekite.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000120"><b>Agate -</b> (Heb. shebo), a precious
      stone in the breast-plate of the high priest (Ex. 28:19;
      39:12), the second in the third row. This may be the agate
      properly so called, a semi-transparent crystallized quartz,
      probably brought from Sheba, whence its name. In Isa. 54:12
      and Ezek. 27:16, this word is the rendering of the Hebrew
      cadcod, which means &quot;ruddy,&quot; and denotes a
      variety of minutely crystalline silica more or less in
      bands of different tints.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is from the Greek name of a stone found in the
      river Achates in Sicily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000121"><b>Age -</b> used to denote the period
      of a man&#39;s life (Gen. 47:28), the maturity of life
      (John 9:21), the latter end of life (Job 11:17), a
      generation of the human race (Job 8:8), and an indefinite
      period (Eph. 2:7; 3:5, 21; Col. 1:26). Respect to be shown
      to the aged (Lev. 19:32). It is a blessing to communities
      when they have old men among them (Isa. 65:20; Zech. 8:4).
      The aged supposed to excel in understanding (Job 12:20;
      15:10; 32:4, 9; 1 Kings 12:6, 8). A full age the reward of
      piety (Job 5:26; Gen. 15:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000122"><b>Agee -</b> fugitive, the father of
      Shammah, who was one of David&#39;s mighty men (2 Sam.
      23:11)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000123"><b>Agony -</b> contest; wrestling;
      severe struggling with pain and suffering. Anguish is the
      reflection on evil that is already past, while agony is a
      struggle with evil at the time present. It is only used in
      the New Testament by Luke (22:44) to describe our
      Lord&#39;s fearful struggle in Gethsemane.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The verb from which the noun &quot;agony&quot; is derived
      is used to denote an earnest endeavour or striving, as
      &quot;Strive [agonize] to enter&quot; (Luke 13:24);
      &quot;Then would my servants fight&quot; [agonize] (John
      18:36). Comp. 1 Cor. 9:25; Col. 1:29; 4:12; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2
      Tim. 4:7, where the words &quot;striveth,&quot;
      &quot;labour,&quot; &quot;conflict,&quot;
      &quot;fight,&quot; are the renderings of the same Greek
      verb.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000124"><b>Agriculture -</b> Tilling the ground
      (Gen. 2:15; 4:2, 3, 12) and rearing cattle were the chief
      employments in ancient times. The Egyptians excelled in
      agriculture. And after the Israelites entered into the
      possession of the Promised Land, their circumstances
      favoured in the highest degree a remarkable development of
      this art. Agriculture became indeed the basis of the Mosaic
      commonwealth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The year in Palestine was divided into six agricultural
      periods:-
    </p>
    <p>
      I. SOWING TIME. Tisri, latter half (beginning about the
      autumnal equinox.) Marchesvan. Kisleu, former half. Early
      rain due = first showers of autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. UNRIPE TIME. Kisleu, latter half. Tebet. Sebat, former
      half.
    </p>
    <p>
      III. COLD SEASON. Sebat, latter half. Adar. [Veadar.]
      Nisan, former half. Latter rain due (Deut. 11:14; Jer.
      5:24; Hos. 6:3; Zech. 10:1; James 5:7; Job 29:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. HARVEST TIME. Nisan, latter half. (Beginning about
      vernal equinox. Barley green. Passover.) Ijar. Sivan,
      former half., Wheat ripe. Pentecost.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. SUMMER (total absence of rain) Sivan, latter half.
      Tammuz. Ab, former half.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. SULTRY SEASON Ab, latter half. Elul. Tisri, former
      half., Ingathering of fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six months from the middle of Tisri to the middle of
      Nisan were occupied with the work of cultivation, and the
      rest of the year mainly with the gathering in of the
      fruits. The extensive and easily-arranged system of
      irrigation from the rills and streams from the mountains
      made the soil in every part of Palestine richly productive
      (Ps. 1:3; 65:10; Prov. 21:1; Isa. 30:25; 32:2, 20; Hos.
      12:11), and the appliances of careful cultivation and of
      manure increased its fertility to such an extent that in
      the days of Solomon, when there was an abundant population,
      &quot;20,000 measures of wheat year by year&quot; were sent
      to Hiram in exchange for timber (1 Kings 5:11), and in
      large quantities also wheat was sent to the Tyrians for the
      merchandise in which they traded (Ezek. 27:17). The wheat
      sometimes produced an hundredfold (Gen. 26:12; Matt.
      13:23). Figs and pomegranates were very plentiful (Num.
      13:23), and the vine and the olive grew luxuriantly and
      produced abundant fruit (Deut. 33:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest the productiveness of the soil should be exhausted, it
      was enjoined that the whole land should rest every seventh
      year, when all agricultural labour would entirely cease
      (Lev. 25:1-7; Deut. 15:1-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was forbidden to sow a field with divers seeds (Deut.
      22:9). A passer-by was at liberty to eat any quantity of
      corn or grapes, but he was not permitted to carry away any
      (Deut. 23:24, 25; Matt. 12:1). The poor were permitted to
      claim the corners of the fields and the gleanings. A
      forgotten sheaf in the field was to be left also for the
      poor. (See Lev. 19:9, 10; Deut. 24:19.)

      Agricultural implements and operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculptured monuments and painted tombs of Egypt and
      Assyria throw much light on this subject, and on the
      general operations of agriculture. Ploughs of a simple
      construction were known in the time of Moses (Deut. 22:10;
      comp. Job 1:14). They were very light, and required great
      attention to keep them in the ground (Luke 9:62). They were
      drawn by oxen (Job 1:14), cows (1 Sam. 6:7), and asses
      (Isa. 30:24); but an ox and an ass must not be yoked
      together in the same plough (Deut. 22:10). Men sometimes
      followed the plough with a hoe to break the clods (Isa.
      28:24). The oxen were urged on by a &quot;goad,&quot; or
      long staff pointed at the end, so that if occasion arose it
      could be used as a spear also (Judg. 3:31; 1 Sam. 13:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      When the soil was prepared, the seed was sown broadcast
      over the field (Matt. 13:3-8). The &quot;harrow&quot;
      mentioned in Job 39:10 was not used to cover the seeds, but
      to break the clods, being little more than a thick block of
      wood. In highly irrigated spots the seed was trampled in by
      cattle (Isa. 32:20); but doubtless there was some kind of
      harrow also for covering in the seed scattered in the
      furrows of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reaping of the corn was performed either by pulling it
      up by the roots, or cutting it with a species of sickle,
      according to circumstances. The corn when cut was generally
      put up in sheaves (Gen. 37:7; Lev. 23:10-15; Ruth 2:7, 15;
      Job 24:10; Jer. 9:22; Micah 4:12), which were afterwards
      gathered to the threshing-floor or stored in barns (Matt.
      6:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of threshing was performed generally by
      spreading the sheaves on the threshing-floor and causing
      oxen and cattle to tread repeatedly over them (Deut. 25:4;
      Isa. 28:28). On occasions flails or sticks were used for
      this purpose (Ruth 2:17; Isa. 28:27). There was also a
      &quot;threshing instrument&quot; (Isa. 41:15; Amos 1:3)
      which was drawn over the corn. It was called by the Hebrews
      a moreg, a threshing roller or sledge (2 Sam. 24:22; 1 Chr.
      21:23; Isa. 3:15). It was somewhat like the Roman tribulum,
      or threshing instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the grain was threshed, it was winnowed by being
      thrown up against the wind (Jer. 4:11), and afterwards
      tossed with wooden scoops (Isa. 30:24). The shovel and the
      fan for winnowing are mentioned in Ps. 35:5, Job 21:18,
      Isa. 17:13. The refuse of straw and chaff was burned (Isa.
      5:24). Freed from impurities, the grain was then laid up in
      granaries till used (Deut. 28:8; Prov. 3:10; Matt. 6:26;
      13:30; Luke 12:18).

      Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. The
      Roman emperor Caligula made him governor first of the

      with the title of king (&quot;king Herod&quot;), and
      finally of that of Antipas, who was banished, and of
      Samaria and Judea. Thus he became ruler over the whole of
      Palestine. He was a persecutor of the early Christians. He
      slew James, and imprisoned Peter (Acts 12:1-4). He died at
      Caesarea, being &quot;eaten of worms&quot; (Acts 12:23),

      invested him with the office of superintendent of the
      Temple of Jerusalem, and made him governor (A.D. 50) of
      Chalcis. He was afterwards raised to the rank of king, and
      made governor over the tetrarchy of Philip and Lysanias
      (Acts 25:13; 26:2, 7). It was before him that Paul
      delivered (A.D. 59) his speech recorded in Acts 26. His
      private life was very profligate. He died (the last of his

      <a name="T0000131"><b>Ahab -</b> father&#39;s brother. (1.)
      The son of Omri, whom he succeeded as the seventh king of
      Israel. His history is recorded in 1 Kings 16-22. His wife
      was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence
      over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he
      added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by
      Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this
      account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill
      him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II.,
      king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive,
      he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into
      his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of
      his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and
      granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three
      years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war (1 Kings
      22:3) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of
      Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that
      he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who
      encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah
      was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his
      purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might
      if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow
      from a bow &quot;drawn at a venture&quot; pierced him, and
      though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards
      evening, and Elijah&#39;s prophecy (1 Kings 21:19) was
      fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three years. Because of his
      idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred to as
      pre-eminently the type of a wicked king (2 Kings 8:18; 2
      Chr. 22:3; Micah 6:16).</a>

      of whom nothing further is known.

    <p>
      <a name="T0000132"><b>Ahasuerus -</b> There are three kings
      designated by this name in Scripture. (1.) The father of
      Darius the Mede, mentioned in Dan. 9:1. This was probably
      the Cyaxares I. known by this name in profane history, the
      king of Media and the conqueror of Nineveh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The king mentioned in Ezra 4:6, probably the Cambyses
      of profane history, the son and successor of Cyrus (B.C.
      529).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The son of Darius Hystaspes, the king named in the
      Book of Esther. He ruled over the kingdoms of Persia,
      Media, and Babylonia, &quot;from India to Ethiopia.&quot;
      This was in all probability the Xerxes of profane history,
      who succeeded his father Darius (B.C. 485). In the LXX.
      version of the Book of Esther the name Artaxerxes occurs
      for Ahasuerus. He reigned for twenty-one years (B.C.
      486-465). He invaded Greece with an army, it is said, of
      more than 2,000,000 soldiers, only 5,000 of whom returned
      with him. Leonidas, with his famous 300, arrested his
      progress at the Pass of Thermopylae, and then he was
      defeated disastrously by Themistocles at Salamis. It was
      after his return from this invasion that Esther was chosen
      as his queen.

      under Ezra when about to return to Jerusalem from Babylon.
      In all probability this was one of the streams of
      Mesopotamia which flowed into the Euphrates somewhere in
      the north-west of Babylonia. It has, however, been supposed
      to be the name of a place (Ezra 8:15) now called Hit, on
      the Euphrates, east of Damascus.</a>

    <p>
      (2.) The son and successor of Jotham, king of Judah (2
      Kings 16; Isa. 7-9; 2 Chr. 28). He gave himself up to a
      life of wickedness and idolatry. Notwithstanding the
      remonstrances and warnings of Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, he
      appealed for help against Rezin, king of Damascus, and
      Pekah, king of Israel, who threatened Jerusalem, to
      Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, to the great injury
      of his kingdom and his own humilating subjection to the
      Assyrians (2 Kings 16:7, 9; 15:29). He also introduced
      among his people many heathen and idolatrous customs (Isa.
      8:19; 38:8; 2 Kings 23:12). He died at the age of
      thirty-five years, after reigning sixteen years (B.C.
      740-724), and was succeeded by his son Hezekiah. Because of
      his wickedness he was &quot;not brought into the sepulchre

      <a name="T0000135"><b>Ahaziah -</b> held by Jehovah. (1.)
      The son and successor of Ahab. He followed the counsels of
      his mother Jezebel, and imitated in wickedness the ways of
      his father. In his reign the Moabites revolted from under
      his authority (2 Kings 3:5-7). He united with Jehoshaphat
      in an attempt to revive maritime trade by the Red Sea,
      which proved a failure (2 Chr. 20:35-37). His messengers,
      sent to consult the god of Ekron regarding his recovery
      from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his
      palace, were met on the way by Elijah, who sent them back
      to tell the king that he would never rise from his bed (1
      Kings 22:51; 2 Kings 1:18).</a>

    <p>
      (2.) The son of Joram, or Jehoram, and sixth king of Judah.
      Called Jehoahaz (2 Chr. 21:17; 25:23), and Azariah (2 Chr.
      22:6). Guided by his idolatrous mother Athaliah, his reign
      was disastrous (2 Kings 8:24-29; 9:29). He joined his uncle
      Jehoram, king of Israel, in an expedition against Hazael,
      king of Damascus; but was wounded at the pass of Gur when
      attempting to escape, and had strength only to reach
      Megiddo, where he died (2 Kings 9:22-28). He reigned only
      one year.

      brother; the same probably as Ahimelech, who was high
      priest at Nob in the reign of Saul (1 Sam. 22:11). Some,
      however, suppose that Ahimelech was the brother of Ahijah,
      and that they both officiated as high priests, Ahijah at
      Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob.

      announcing the rending of the ten tribes from Solomon; and
      1 Kings 14:6-16, delivered to Jeroboam&#39;s wife,
      foretelling the death of Abijah the king&#39;s son, the
      destruction of Jeroboam&#39;s house, and the captivity of
      Israel &quot;beyond the river.&quot; Jeroboam bears

      Gedaliah, governor of Judea after the destruction of
      Jerusalem by the Babylonians (2 Kings 25:22; Jer. 40:5-16;

      priest (1 Chr. 6:8, 53). On the occasion of the revolt of
      Absalom he remained faithful to David, and was of service
      to him in conveying to him tidings of the proceedings of
      Absalom in Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:24-37; 17:15-21). He was
      swift of foot, and was the first to carry to David tidings
      of the defeat of Absalom, although he refrained, from
      delicacy of feeling, from telling him of his death (2 Sam.

      <a name="T0000143"><b>Ahimelech -</b> brother of the king,
      the son of Ahitub and father of Abiathar (1 Sam. 22:20-23).
      He descended from Eli in the line of Ithamar. In 1 Chr.
      18:16 he is called Abimelech, and is probably the same as
      Ahiah (1 Sam. 14:3, 18). He was the twelfth high priest,
      and officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (to
      whom and his companions he gave five loaves of the
      showbread) when he fled from Saul (1 Sam. 21:1-9). He was
      summoned into Saul&#39;s presence, and accused, on the
      information of Doeg the Edomite, of disloyalty because of
      his kindness to David; whereupon the king commanded that
      he, with the other priests who stood beside him (86 in
      all), should be put to death. This sentence was carried
      into execution by Doeg in the most cruel manner (1 Sam.
      22:9-23). Possibly Abiathar had a son also called
      Ahimelech, or the two names, as some think, may have been
      accidentally transposed in 2 Sam. 8:17; 1 Chr. 18:16,

      the cause of Absalom (2 Sam. 15:12). David sent his old
      friend Hushai back to Absalom, in order that he might
      counteract the counsel of Ahithophel (2 Sam. 15:31-37).
      This end was so far gained that Ahithophel saw he had no
      longer any influence, and accordingly he at once left the
      camp of Absalom and returned to Giloh, his native place,
      where, after arranging his wordly affairs, he hanged
      himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (2
      Sam. 17:1-23). He was the type of Judas (Ps. 41:9).</a>

      Because of her crimes, she was carried away captive, and

      district among the mountains of Edom, probably near Mount

      was the scene of Joshua&#39;s defeat, and afterwards of his
      victory. It was the second Canaanite city taken by Israel
      (Josh. 7:2-5; 8:1-29). It lay rebuilt and inhibited by the
      Benjamites (Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32; 11:31). It lay to the
      east of Bethel, &quot;beside Beth-aven.&quot; The spot
      which is most probably the site of this ancient city is
      Haiyan, 2 miles east from Bethel. It lay up the Wady
      Suweinit, a steep, rugged valley, extending from the Jordan
      valley to Bethel.</a>

      the name of some song or tune to the measure of which the

      name some instrument of music, or an allegorical allusion
      to the subject of the psalm.</a>

      Hebrew <i>ruah</i> (Job 41:16); elsewhere it is the
      rendering of <i>shamaiyim</i>, usually translated
      &quot;heavens.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression &quot;to speak into the air&quot; (1 Cor.
      14:9) is a proverb denoting to speak in vain, as to
      &quot;beat the air&quot; (1 Cor. 9:26) denotes to labour in
      vain.

      <a name="T0000161"><b>Ajalon -</b> and Aij&#39;alon, place
      of deer. (1.) A town and valley originally assigned to the
      tribe of Dan, from which, however, they could not drive the
      Amorites (Judg. 1:35). It was one of the Levitical cities
      given to the Kohathites (1 Chr. 6:69). It was not far from
      Beth-shemesh (2 Chr. 28:18). It was the boundary between
      the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and is frequently
      mentioned in Jewish history (2 Chr. 11:10; 1 Sam. 14:31; 1
      Chr. 8:13). With reference to the valley named after the
      town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, &quot;Sun,
      stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley
      of Ajalon&quot; (Josh. 10:12). It has been identified as
      the modern Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.).
      In the Tell Amarna letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the
      destruction of the &quot;city of Ajalon&quot; by the
      invaders, and describes himself as &quot;afflicted, greatly
      afflicted&quot; by the calamities that had come on the

      the general name given to the ridge containing the pass
      between the south of the Dead Sea and Zin, es-Sufah, by
      which there is an ascent to the level of the land of
      Palestine. Scorpions are said to abound in this whole
      district, and hence the name (Num. 34:4). It is called
      &quot;Maaleh-acrabbim&quot; in Josh. 15:3, and &quot;the
      ascent of Akrabbim&quot; in Num. 34:4.</a>

      <a name="T0000164"><b>Alabaster -</b> occurs only in the
      New Testament in connection with the box of &quot;ointment
      of spikenard very precious,&quot; with the contents of
      which a woman anointed the head of Jesus as he sat at
      supper in the house of Simon the leper (Matt. 26:7; Mark
      14:3; Luke 7:37). These boxes were made from a stone found
      near Alabastron in Egypt, and from this circumstance the
      Greeks gave them the name of the city where they were made.
      The name was then given to the stone of which they were
      made; and finally to all perfume vessels, of whatever
      material they were formed. The woman &quot;broke&quot; the
      vessel; i.e., she broke off, as was usually done, the long
      and narrow neck so as to reach the contents. This stone
      resembles marble, but is softer in its texture, and hence
      very easily wrought into boxes. Mark says (14:5) that this
      box of ointment was worth more than 300 pence, i.e.,
      denarii, each of the value of sevenpence halfpenny of our
      money, and therefore worth about 10 pounds. But if we take
      the denarius as the day&#39;s wage of a labourer (Matt.
      20:2), say two shillings of our money, then the whole would
      be worth about 30 pounds, so costly was Mary&#39;s
      offering.</a>

      (3.) A Jew of Ephesus who took a prominent part in the
      uproar raised there by the preaching of Paul (Acts 19:33).
      The Jews put him forward to plead their cause before the
      mob. It was probably intended that he should show that he
      and the other Jews had no sympathy with Paul any more than
      the Ephesians had. It is possible that this man was the
      same as the following.

    <p>
      (4.) A coppersmith who, with Hymenaeus and others,
      promulgated certain heresies regarding the resurrection (1
      Tim. 1:19; 2 Tim. 4:14), and made shipwreck of faith and of
      a good conscience. Paul excommunicated him (1 Tim. 1:20;

      the leopard and the he-goat (7:6; 11:3,4). He succeeded his
      father Philip, and died at the age of thirty-two from the
      effects of intemperance, B.C. 323. His empire was divided
      among his four generals.</a>

      <a name="T0000170"><b>Alexandria -</b> the ancient
      metropolis of Lower Egypt, so called from its founder,
      Alexander the Great (about B.C. 333). It was for a long
      period the greatest of existing cities, for both Nineveh
      and Babylon had been destroyed, and Rome had not yet risen
      to greatness. It was the residence of the kings of Egypt
      for 200 years. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament,
      and only incidentally in the New. Apollos, eloquent and
      mighty in the Scriptures, was a native of this city (Acts
      18:24). Many Jews from Alexandria were in Jerusalem, where
      they had a synagogue (Acts 6:9), at the time of
      Stephen&#39;s martyrdom. At one time it is said that as
      many as 10,000 Jews resided in this city. It possessed a
      famous library of 700,000 volumes, which was burned by the
      Saracens (A.D. 642). It was here that the Hebrew Bible was
      translated into Greek. This is called the Septuagint
      version, from the tradition that seventy learned men were
      engaged in executing it. It was, however, not all
      translated at one time. It was begun B.C. 280, and finished
      about B.C. 200 or 150. (See <a href=

      (1.) Those who were strangers generally, and who owned no
      landed property.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Strangers dwelling in another country without being
      naturalized (Lev. 22:10; Ps. 39:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of these classes were to enjoy, under certain
      conditions, the same rights as other citizens (Lev. 19:33,
      34; Deut. 10:19). They might be naturalized and permitted
      to enter into the congregation of the Lord by submitting to
      circumcision and abandoning idolatry (Deut. 23:3-8).

    </p>
    <p>
      Every parable is an allegory. Nathan (2 Sam. 12:1-4)
      addresses David in an allegorical narrative. In the
      eightieth Psalm there is a beautiful allegory: &quot;Thou

    <p>
      Abraham formed an alliance with some of the Canaanitish
      princes (Gen. 14:13), also with Abimelech (21:22-32).
      Joshua and the elders of Israel entered into an alliance
      with the Gibeonites (Josh. 9:3-27). When the Israelites
      entered Palestine they were forbidden to enter into
      alliances with the inhabitants of the country (Lev. 18:3,
      4; 20:22, 23).
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon formed a league with Hiram (1 Kings 5:12). This
      &quot;brotherly covenant&quot; is referred to 250 years
      afterwards (Amos 1:9). He also appears to have entered into
      an alliance with Pharaoh (1 Kings 10:28, 29).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the subsequent history of the kingdoms of Judah and
      Israel various alliances were formed between them and also
      with neighbouring nations at different times.
    </p>
    <p>
      From patriarchal times a covenant of alliance was sealed by
      the blood of some sacrificial victim. The animal sacrificed
      was cut in two (except birds), and between these two parts
      the persons contracting the alliance passed (Gen. 15:10).
      There are frequent allusions to this practice (Jer. 34:18).
      Such alliances were called &quot;covenants of salt&quot;
      (Num. 18:19; 2 Chr. 13:5), salt being the symbol of
      perpetuity. A pillar was set up as a memorial of the
      alliance between Laban and Jacob (Gen. 31:52). The Jews
      throughout their whole history attached great importance to
      fidelity to their engagements. Divine wrath fell upon the
      violators of them (Josh. 9:18; 2 Sam. 21:1, 2; Ezek.
      17:16).

      Palestine. In form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the
      peach tree. Its blossoms are of a very pale pink colour,
      and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew name, <i>
      shaked</i>, signifying &quot;wakeful, hastening,&quot; is
      given to it on account of its putting forth its blossoms so
      early, generally in February, and sometimes even in
      January. In Eccl. 12:5, it is referred to as illustrative,
      probably, of the haste with which old age comes. There are
      others, however, who still contend for the old
      interpretation here. &quot;The almond tree bears its
      blossoms in the midst of winter, on a naked, leafless stem,
      and these blossoms (reddish or flesh-coloured in the
      beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly like
      white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very
      fitting symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its
      wintry, dry, barren, unfruitful condition.&quot; In Jer.
      1:11 &quot;I see a rod of an almond tree [shaked]...for I
      will hasten [shaked] my word to perform it&quot; the word
      is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired his sons
      (Gen. 43:11) to take with them into Egypt of the best
      fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph,
      probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt.
      Aaron&#39;s rod yielded almonds (Num. 17:8; Heb. 9:4).
      Moses was directed to make certain parts of the candlestick
      for the ark of carved work &quot;like unto almonds&quot;
      (Ex. 25:33, 34). The Hebrew word <i>luz</i>, translated
      &quot;hazel&quot; in the Authorized Version (Gen. 30:37),
      is rendered in the Revised Version &quot;almond.&quot; It
      is probable that <i>luz</i> denotes the wild almond, while
      <i>shaked</i> denotes the cultivated variety.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000181"><b>Alms -</b> Not found in the Old
      Testament, but repeatedly in the New. The Mosaic
      legislation (Lev. 25:35; Deut. 15:7) tended to promote a
      spirit of charity, and to prevent the occurrence of
      destitution among the people. Such passages as these, Ps.
      41:1; 112:9; Prov. 14:31; Isa. 10:2; Amos 2:7; Jer. 5:28;
      Ezek. 22:29, would also naturally foster the same
      benevolent spirit.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of our Lord begging was common (Mark 10:46;
      Acts 3:2). The Pharisees were very ostentatious in their
      almsgivings (Matt. 6:2). The spirit by which the Christian
      ought to be actuated in this duty is set forth in 1 John
      3:17. A regard to the state of the poor and needy is
      enjoined as a Christian duty (Luke 3:11; 6:30; Matt. 6:1;
      Acts 9:36; 10:2, 4), a duty which was not neglected by the
      early Christians (Luke 14:13; Acts 20:35; Gal. 2:10; Rom.
      15:25-27; 1 Cor. 16:1-4). They cared not only for the poor
      among themselves, but contributed also to the necessities
      of those at a distance (Acts 11:29; 24:17; 2 Cor. 9:12).
      Our Lord and his attendants showed an example also in this
      (John 13:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times the &quot;poor-laws&quot; have introduced
      an element which modifies considerably the form in which we
      may discharge this Christian duty.

    <p>
      <a name="T0000182"><b>Almug -</b> (1 Kings 10:11, 12) =
      algum (2 Chr. 2:8; 9:10, 11), in the Hebrew occurring only
      in the plural <i>almuggim</i> (indicating that the wood was
      brought in planks), the name of a wood brought from Ophir
      to be used in the building of the temple, and for other
      purposes. Some suppose it to have been the white
      sandal-wood of India, the Santalum album of botanists, a
      native of the mountainous parts of the Malabar coasts. It
      is a fragrant wood, and is used in China for incense in
      idol-worship. Others, with some probability, think that it
      was the Indian red sandal-wood, the pterocarpus santalinus,
      a heavy, fine-grained wood, the Sanscrit name of which is
      valguka. It is found on the Coromandel coast and in
      Ceylon.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000183"><b>Aloes -</b> (Heb. &#39;ahalim), a
      fragrant wood (Num. 24:6; Ps. 45:8; Prov. 7:17; Cant.
      4:14), the Aquilaria agallochum of botanists, or, as some
      suppose, the costly gum or perfume extracted from the wood.
      It is found in China, Siam, and Northern India, and grows
      to the height sometimes of 120 feet. This species is of
      great rarity even in India. There is another and more
      common species, called by Indians aghil, whence Europeans
      have given it the name of Lignum aquile, or eagle-wood.
      Aloewood was used by the Egyptians for embalming dead
      bodies. Nicodemus brought it (pounded aloe-wood) to embalm
      the body of Christ (John 19:39); but whether this was the
      same as that mentioned elsewhere is uncertain.</a>
    </p>

      The bitter aloes of the apothecary is the dried juice of
      the leaves Aloe vulgaris.

      <a name="T0000184"><b>Alphaeus -</b> (1.) The father of
      James the Less, the apostle and writer of the epistle
      (Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13), and the
      husband of Mary (John 19:25). The Hebrew form of this name
      is Cleopas, or Clopas (q.v.).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000185"><b>Altar -</b> (Heb. mizbe&#39;ah, from
      a word meaning &quot;to slay&quot;), any structure of earth
      (Ex. 20:24) or unwrought stone (20:25) on which sacrifices
      were offered. Altars were generally erected in conspicuous
      places (Gen. 22:9; Ezek. 6:3; 2 Kings 23:12; 16:4; 23:8;
      Acts 14:13). The word is used in Heb. 13:10 for the
      sacrifice offered upon it--the sacrifice Christ
      offered.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul found among the many altars erected in Athens one
      bearing the inscription, &quot;To the unknown God&quot;
      (Acts 17:23), or rather &quot;to an [i.e., some] unknown
      God.&quot; The reason for this inscription cannot now be
      accurately determined. It afforded the apostle the occasion
      of proclaiming the gospel to the &quot;men of Athens.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first altar we read of is that erected by Noah (Gen.
      8:20). Altars were erected by Abraham (Gen. 12:7; 13:4;
      22:9), by Isaac (Gen. 26:25), by Jacob (33:20; 35:1, 3),
      and by Moses (Ex. 17:15, &quot;Jehovah-nissi&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple, two altars
      were erected.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The altar of burnt offering (Ex. 30:28), called also
      the &quot;brasen altar&quot; (Ex. 39:39) and &quot;the
      table of the Lord&quot; (Mal. 1:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      This altar, as erected in the tabernacle, is described in
      Ex. 27:1-8. It was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and
      in breadth, and 3 cubits in height. It was made of shittim
      wood, and was overlaid with plates of brass. Its corners
      were ornamented with &quot;horns&quot; (Ex. 29:12; Lev.
      4:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ex. 27:3 the various utensils appertaining to the altar
      are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Comp. 1 Sam.
      2:13, 14; Lev. 16:12; Num. 16:6, 7.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In Solomon&#39;s temple the altar was of larger dimensions
      (2 Chr. 4:1. Comp. 1 Kings 8:22, 64; 9:25), and was made
      wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth.
      This altar was renewed by Asa (2 Chr. 15:8). It was removed
      by Ahaz (2 Kings 16:14), and &quot;cleansed&quot; by
      Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt.
      It was finally broken up and carried away by the
      Babylonians (Jer. 52:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the return from captivity it was re-erected (Ezra
      3:3, 6) on the same place where it had formerly stood.
      (Comp. 1 Macc. 4:47.) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged
      Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its
      place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (70
      A.D.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out (Lev.
      6:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great
      dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a
      rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in
      its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in
      its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement.
      This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon&#39;s
      temple was built. It was in all probability the site of the
      altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave,
      which may probably have been the granary of Araunah&#39;s
      threshing-floor (1 Chr. 21:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The altar of incense (Ex. 30:1-10), called also
      &quot;the golden altar&quot; (39:38; Num. 4:11), stood in
      the holy place &quot;before the vail that is by the ark of
      the testimony.&quot; On this altar sweet spices were
      continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar.
      The morning and the evening services were commenced by the
      high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of
      the incense was a type of prayer (Ps. 141:2; Rev. 5:8; 8:3,
      4).
    </p>
    <p>
      This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood
      overlaid with gold (Ex. 37:25, 26). It was 1 cubit in
      length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Solomon&#39;s temple the altar was similar in size, but
      was made of cedar-wood (1 Kings 6:20; 7:48) overlaid with
      gold. In Ezek. 41:22 it is called &quot;the altar of
      wood.&quot; (Comp. Ex. 30:1-6.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored.
      Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards
      restored by Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc. 1:23; 4:49). Among
      the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of
      Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any
      mention made of it in Heb. 9. It was at this altar
      Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him (Luke
      1:11). It is the only altar which appears in the heavenly
      temple (Isa. 6:6; Rev. 8:3,4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000186"><b>Altaschith -</b> destroy not, the
      title of Ps. 57, 58, 59, and 75. It was probably the name
      of some song to the melody of which these psalms were to be
      chanted.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000187"><b>Alush -</b> one of the places, the
      last before Rephidim, at which the Hebrews rested on their
      way to Sinai (Num. 33:13, 14). It was probably situated on
      the shore of the Red Sea.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000188"><b>Amalek -</b> dweller in a valley, the
      son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau (Gen. 36:12; 1 Chr.
      1:36); the chief of an Idumean tribe (Gen. 36:16). His
      mother was a Horite, a tribe whose territory the
      descendants of Esau had seized.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000189"><b>Amalekite -</b> a tribe that dwelt in
      Arabia Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. They
      were not the descendants of Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, for
      they existed in the days of Abraham (Gen. 14:7). They were
      probably a tribe that migrated from the shores of the
      Persian Gulf and settled in Arabia. &quot;They dwelt in the
      land of the south...from Havilah until thou comest to
      Shur&quot; (Num. 13:29; 1 Sam. 15:7). They were a pastoral,
      and hence a nomadic race. Their kings bore the hereditary
      name of Agag (Num. 24:7; 1 Sam. 15:8). They attempted to
      stop the Israelites when they marched through their
      territory (Deut. 25:18), attacking them at Rephidim (Ex.
      17:8-13; comp. Deut. 25:17; 1 Sam. 15:2). They afterwards
      attacked the Israelites at Hormah (Num. 14:45). We read of
      them subsequently as in league with the Moabites (Judg.
      3:13) and the Midianites (Judg. 6:3). Saul finally
      desolated their territory and destroyed their power (1 Sam.
      14:48; 15:3), and David recovered booty from them (1 Sam.
      30:18-20). In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called
      Sute, in those of Egypt Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets
      include them under the general name of Khabbati, or
      &quot;plunderers.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000190"><b>Amana -</b> perennial. (1.) The
      Hebrew margin of 2 Kings 5:12 gives this as another reading
      of Abana (q.v.), a stream near Damascus.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A mountain (Cant. 4:8), probably the southern summit
      of Anti-Libanus, at the base of which are the sources of
      the Abana.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000191"><b>Amariah -</b> said by Jehovah. (1.)
      One of the descendants of Aaron by Eleazar (1 Chr. 6:7,52).
      He was probably the last of the high priests of
      Eleazar&#39;s line prior to the transfer of that office to
      Eli, of the line of Ithamar.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite, son of Hebron, of the lineage of Moses (1
      Chr. 23:19; 24:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A &quot;chief priest&quot; who took an active part in
      the reformation under Jehoshaphat (2 Chr. 19:11); probably
      the same as mentioned in 1 Chr. 6:9.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) 1 Chr. 6:11; Ezra 7:3. (5.) One of the high priests in
      the time of Hezekiah (2 Chr. 31:15). (6.) Zeph. 1:1. (7.)
      Neh. 11:4. (8.) Neh. 10:3. (9.) Ezra 10:42.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000192"><b>Amasa -</b> burden. (1.) The son of
      Abigail, a sister of king David (1 Chr. 2:17; 2 Sam.
      17:25). He was appointed by David to command the army in
      room of his cousin Joab (2 Sam. 19:13), who afterwards
      treacherously put him to death as a dangerous rival (2 Sam.
      20:4-12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A son of Hadlai, and chief of Ephraim (2 Chr. 28:12)
      in the reign of Ahaz.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000193"><b>Amasai -</b> burdensome. (1.) A
      Levite, son of Elkanah, of the ancestry of Samuel (1 Chr.
      6:25, 35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The leader of a body of men who joined David in the
      &quot;stronghold,&quot; probably of Adullam (1 Chr. 12:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) One of the priests appointed to precede the ark with
      blowing of trumpets on its removal from the house of
      Obed-edom (1 Chr. 15:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The father of a Levite, one of the two Kohathites who
      took a prominent part at the instance of Hezekiah in the
      cleansing of the temple (2 Chr. 29:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000194"><b>Amashai -</b> the son of Azareel,
      appointed by Nehemiah to reside at Jerusalem and do the
      work of the temple (Neh. 11:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000195"><b>Amasiah -</b> burden of (i.e.,
      &quot;sustained by&quot;) Jehovah, the &quot;son of Zichri,
      who willingly offered himself unto the Lord,&quot; a
      captain over thousands under Jehoshaphat (2 Chr. 17:16;
      comp. Judg. 5:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000196"><b>Amaziah -</b> strengthened by
      Jehovah. (1.) A Levite, son of Hilkiah, of the descendants
      of Ethan the Merarite (1 Chr. 6:45).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son and successor of Joash, and eighth king of the
      separate kingdom of Judah (2 Kings 14:1-4). He began his
      reign by punishing the murderers of his father (5-7; 2 Chr.
      25:3-5). He was the first to employ a mercenary army of
      100,000 Israelite soldiers, which he did in his attempt to
      bring the Edomites again under the yoke of Judah (2 Chr.
      25:5, 6). He was commanded by a prophet of the Lord to send
      back the mercenaries, which he did (2 Chr. 25:7-10, 13),
      much to their annoyance. His obedience to this command was
      followed by a decisive victory over the Edomites (2 Chr.
      25:14-16). Amaziah began to worship some of the idols he
      took from the Edomites, and this was his ruin, for he was
      vanquished by Joash, king of Israel, whom he challenged to
      battle. The disaster he thus brought upon Judah by his
      infatuation in proclaiming war against Israel probably
      occasioned the conspiracy by which he lost his life (2
      Kings 14:8-14, 19). He was slain at Lachish, whither he had
      fled, and his body was brought upon horses to Jerusalem,
      where it was buried in the royal sepulchre (2 Kings 14:19,
      20; 2 Chr. 25:27, 28).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A priest of the golden calves at Bethel (Amos
      7:10-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The father of Joshah, one of the Simeonite chiefs in
      the time of Hezekiah (1 Chr. 4:34).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000197"><b>Ambassador -</b> In the Old Testament
      the Hebrew word <i>tsir</i>, meaning &quot;one who goes on
      an errand,&quot; is rendered thus (Josh. 9:4; Prov. 13:17;
      Isa. 18:2; Jer. 49:14; Obad. 1:1). This is also the
      rendering of <i>melits</i>, meaning &quot;an
      interpreter,&quot; in 2 Chr. 32:31; and of <i>malak</i>, a
      &quot;messenger,&quot; in 2 Chr. 35:21; Isa. 30:4; 33:7;
      Ezek. 17:15. This is the name used by the apostle as
      designating those who are appointed by God to declare his
      will (2 Cor. 5:20; Eph. 6:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrews on various occasions and for various purposes
      had recourse to the services of ambassadors, e.g., to
      contract alliances (Josh. 9:4), to solicit favours (Num.
      20:14), to remonstrate when wrong was done (Judg. 11:12),
      to condole with a young king on the death of his father (2
      Sam. 10:2), and to congratulate a king on his accession to
      the throne (1 Kings 5:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      To do injury to an ambassador was to insult the king who
      sent him (2 Sam. 10:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000198"><b>Amber -</b> (Ezek. 1:4, 27; 8:2.
      Heb., hashmal, rendered by the LXX. elektron, and by the
      Vulgate electrum), a metal compounded of silver and gold.
      Some translate the word by &quot;polished brass,&quot;
      others &quot;fine brass,&quot; as in Rev. 1:15; 2:18. It
      was probably the mixture now called electrum. The word has
      no connection, however, with what is now called amber,
      which is a gummy substance, reckoned as belonging to the
      mineral kingdom though of vegetable origin, a fossil
      resin.</a>

      <a name="T0000199"><b>Ambush -</b> Joshua at the capture of
      Ai lay in ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he
      gained an easy victory (Josh. 8:4-26). Shechem was taken in
      this manner (Judg. 9:30-45. Comp. Jer. 51:12). </a>
