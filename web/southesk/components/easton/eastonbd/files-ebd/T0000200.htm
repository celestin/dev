      <a name="T0000200"><b>Amen -</b> This Hebrew word means
      firm, and hence also faithful (Rev. 3:14). In Isa. 65:16,
      the Authorized Version has &quot;the God of truth,&quot;
      which in Hebrew is &quot;the God of Amen.&quot; It is
      frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his
      words, where it is translated &quot;verily.&quot;
      Sometimes, only, however, in John&#39;s Gospel, it is
      repeated, &quot;Verily, verily.&quot; It is used as an
      epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rev. 3:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of
      prayers (Ps. 41:13; 72:19; 89:52), to confirm the words and
      invoke the fulfilment of them. It is used in token of being
      bound by an oath (Num. 5:22; Deut. 27:15-26; Neh. 5:13;
      8:6; 1 Chr. 16:36). In the primitive churches it was common
      for the general audience to say &quot;Amen&quot; at the
      close of the prayer (1 Cor. 14:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and
      sure (2 Cor. 1:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000201"><b>Amethyst -</b> one of the precious
      stones in the breastplate of the high priest (Ex. 28:19;
      39:12), and in the foundation of the New Jerusalem (Rev.
      21:20). The ancients thought that this stone had the power
      of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore or touched it,
      and hence its Greek name formed from <i>a_,
      &quot;privative,&quot; and _methuo</i>, &quot;to get
      drunk.&quot; Its Jewish name, <i>ahlamah&#39;</i>, was
      derived by the rabbins from the Hebrew word <i>halam</i>,
      &quot;to dream,&quot; from its supposed power of causing
      the wearer to dream.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a pale-blue crystallized quartz, varying to a dark
      purple blue. It is found in Persia and India, also in
      different parts of Europe.

      <a name="T0000205"><b>Ammiel -</b> people of God. (1.) One
      of the twelve spies sent by Moses to search the land of

      prince. (1.) The father of Nahshon, who was chief of the
      tribe of Judah (Num. 1:7; 2:3; 7:12, 17; 10:14). His

    </p>
    <p>

      Cant. 6:12, whose chariots were famed for their swiftness.
      It is rendered in the margin &quot;my willing people,&quot;
      and in the Revised Version &quot;my princely
      people.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000209"><b>Ammishaddai -</b> people of the
      Almighty, the father of Ahiezer, who was chief of the
      Danites at the time of the Exodus (Num. 1:12; 2:25). This
      is one of the few names compounded with the name of God,
      Shaddai, &quot;Almighty.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000210"><b>Ammizabad -</b> people of the giver,
      the son of Benaiah, who was the third and chief captain of
      the host under David (1 Chr. 27:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000211"><b>Ammon -</b> another form of the name
      Ben-ammi, the son of Lot (Gen. 19:38). This name is also
      used for his posterity (Ps. 83:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000212"><b>Ammonite -</b> the usual name of the
      descendants of Ammon, the son of Lot (Gen. 19:38). From the
      very beginning (Deut. 2:16-20) of their history till they
      are lost sight of (Judg. 5:2), this tribe is closely
      associated with the Moabites (Judg. 10:11; 2 Chr. 20:1;
      Zeph. 2:8). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse
      Israel (Deut. 23:4). The Ammonites were probably more of a
      predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the
      Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east
      of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from
      which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims (Deut.
      2:20; Gen. 14:5). They are known as the Beni-ammi (Gen.
      19:38), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god.
      They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the
      Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to
      the Israelites when passing through their territory, and
      therefore they were prohibited from &quot;entering the
      congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation&quot;
      (Deut. 23:3). They afterwards became hostile to Israel
      (Judg. 3:13). Jephthah waged war against them, and
      &quot;took twenty cities with a very great slaughter&quot;
      (Judg. 11:33). They were again signally defeated by Saul (1
      Sam. 11:11). David also defeated them and their allies the
      Syrians (2 Sam. 10:6-14), and took their chief city,
      Rabbah, with much spoil (2 Sam. 10:14; 12:26-31). The
      subsequent events of their history are noted in 2 Chr.
      20:25; 26:8; Jer. 49:1; Ezek. 25:3, 6. One of Solomon&#39;s
      wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of
      Rehoboam (1 Kings 14:31; 2 Chr. 12:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the
      Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel (Zeph. 2:8;
      Jer. 49:1-6; Ezek. 25:1-5, 10; Amos 1:13-15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or
      Milcom, at whose altar they offered human sacrifices (1
      Kings 11:5, 7). The high places built for this idol by
      Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were
      not destroyed till the time of Josiah (2 Kings 23:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000213"><b>Amnon -</b> faithful. (1.) One of the
      sons of Shammai, of the children of Ezra (1 Chr. 4:20;
      comp. 17).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The eldest son of David, by Ahinoam of Jezreel (1 Chr.
      3:1; 2 Sam. 3:2). Absalom caused him to be put to death for
      his great crime in the matter of Tamar (2 Sam. 13:28, 29).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000214"><b>Amon -</b> builder. (1.) The governor
      of Samaria in the time of Ahab. The prophet Micaiah was
      committed to his custody (1 Kings 22:26; 2 Chr. 18:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son of Manasseh, and fourteenth king of Judah. He
      restored idolatry, and set up the images which his father
      had cast down. Zephaniah (1:4; 3:4, 11) refers to the moral
      depravity prevailing in this king&#39;s reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was assassinated (2 Kings 21:18-26: 2 Chr. 33:20-25) by
      his own servants, who conspired against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) An Egyptian god, usually depicted with a human body
      and the head of a ram, referred to in Jer. 46:25, where the
      word &quot;multitudes&quot; in the Authorized Version is
      more appropriately rendered &quot;Amon&quot; in the Revised
      Version. In Nah. 3:8 the expression &quot;populous No&quot;
      of the Authorized version is rendered in the Revised
      Version &quot;No-amon.&quot; Amon is identified with Ra,
      the sun-god of Heliopolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Neh. 7:59.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000215"><b>Amorites -</b> highlanders, or
      hillmen, the name given to the descendants of one of the
      sons of Canaan (Gen. 14:7), called Amurra or Amurri in the
      Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions. On the early Babylonian
      monuments all Syria, including Palestine, is known as
      &quot;the land of the Amorites.&quot; The southern slopes
      of the mountains of Judea are called the &quot;mount of the
      Amorites&quot; (Deut. 1:7, 19, 20). They seem to have
      originally occupied the land stretching from the heights
      west of the Dead Sea (Gen. 14:7) to Hebron (13. Comp. 13:8;
      Deut. 3:8; 4:46-48), embracing &quot;all Gilead and all
      Bashan&quot; (Deut. 3:10), with the Jordan valley on the
      east of the river (4:49), the land of the &quot;two kings
      of the Amorites,&quot; Sihon and Og (Deut. 31:4; Josh.
      2:10; 9:10). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated
      with great slaughter by Joshua (10:10). They were again
      defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them
      till there were none remaining (Josh. 11:8). It is
      mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of
      Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites (1
      Sam. 7:14). The discrepancy supposed to exist between Deut.
      1:44 and Num. 14:45 is explained by the circumstance that
      the terms &quot;Amorites&quot; and &quot;Amalekites&quot;
      are used synonymously for the &quot;Canaanites.&quot; In
      the same way we explain the fact that the
      &quot;Hivites&quot; of Gen. 34:2 are the
      &quot;Amorites&quot; of 48:22. Comp. Josh. 10:6; 11:19 with
      2 Sam. 21:2; also Num. 14:45 with Deut. 1:44. The Amorites
      were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the
      Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes,
      aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to
      have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is
      described by Moses as the last &quot;of the remnant of the
      giants&quot; (Deut. 3:11). Both Sihon and Og were
      independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language
      survives, &quot;Shenir,&quot; the name they gave to Mount
      Hermon (Deut. 3:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000216"><b>Amos -</b> borne; a burden, one of
      the twelve minor prophets. He was a native of Tekota, the
      modern Tekua, a town about 12 miles south-east of
      Bethlehem. He was a man of humble birth, neither a
      &quot;prophet nor a prophet&#39;s son,&quot; but &quot;an
      herdman and a dresser of sycomore trees,&quot; R.V. He
      prophesied in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and was
      contemporary with Isaiah and Hosea (Amos 1:1; 7:14, 15;
      Zech. 14:5), who survived him a few years. Under Jeroboam
      II. the kingdom of Israel rose to the zenith of its
      prosperity; but that was followed by the prevalence of
      luxury and vice and idolatry. At this period Amos was
      called from his obscurity to remind the people of the law
      of God&#39;s retributive justice, and to call them to
      repentance.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Book of Amos consists of three parts:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The nations around are summoned to judgment because of
      their sins (1:1-2:3). He quotes Joel 3:16.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The spiritual condition of Judah, and especially of
      Israel, is described (2:4-6:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In 7:1-9:10 are recorded five prophetic visions. (a)
      The first two (7:1-6) refer to judgments against the guilty
      people. (b) The next two (7:7-9; 8:1-3) point out the
      ripeness of the people for the threatened judgements.
      7:10-17 consists of a conversation between the prophet and
      the priest of Bethel. (c) The fifth describes the overthrow
      and ruin of Israel (9:1-10); to which is added the promise
      of the restoration of the kingdom and its final glory in
      the Messiah&#39;s kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style is peculiar in the number of the allusions made
      to natural objects and to agricultural occupations. Other
      allusions show also that Amos was a student of the law as
      well as a &quot;child of nature.&quot; These phrases are
      peculiar to him: &quot;Cleanness of teeth&quot; [i.e., want
      of bread] (4:6); &quot;The excellency of Jacob&quot; (6:8;
      8:7); &quot;The high places of Isaac&quot; (7:9); &quot;The
      house of Isaac&quot; (7:16); &quot;He that createth the
      wind&quot; (4:13). Quoted, Acts 7:42.

      prophet Isaiah (2 Kings 19:2, 20; 20:1; Isa. 1:1; 2:1). As
      to his personal history little is positively known. He is
      supposed by some to have been the &quot;man of God&quot;

      (2.) One of the two sons of Zibeon the Horite, and father

      <a name="T0000225"><b>Anakim -</b> the descendants of Anak
      (Josh. 11:21; Num. 13:33; Deut. 9:2). They dwelt in the
      south of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Hebron (Gen.
      23:2; Josh. 15:13). In the days of Abraham (Gen. 14:5, 6)
      they inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and
      Moab, east of the Jordan. They were probably a remnant of
      the original inhabitants of Palestine before the
      Canaanites, a Cushite tribe from Babel, and of the same
      race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian shepherd kings.
      Their formidable warlike appearance, as described by the
      spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with
      terror. They seem to have identified them with the
      Nephilim, the &quot;giants&quot; (Gen. 6:4; Num. 13:33) of
      the antediluvian age. There were various tribes of Anakim
      (Josh. 15:14). Joshua finally expelled them from the land,
      except a remnant that found a refuge in the cities of Gaza,
      Gath, and Ashdod (Josh. 11:22). The Philistine giants whom
      David encountered (2 Sam. 21:15-22) were descendants of the
      Anakim. (See <a href=

      worshipped by the people of Sepharvaim, who colonized
      Samaria (2 Kings 17:31). The name means &quot;Anu is
      king.&quot; It was a female deity representing the moon, as

      the name of a town in the tribe of Benjamin between Nob and
      Hazor (Neh. 11:32). It is probably the modern Beit Hanina,
      a small village 3 miles north of Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000230"><b>Ananias -</b> a common Jewish name,
      the same as Hananiah. (1.) One of the members of the church
      at Jerusalem, who conspired with his wife Sapphira to
      deceive the brethren, and who fell down and immediately
      expired after he had uttered the falsehood (Acts 5:5). By
      common agreement the members of the early Christian
      community devoted their property to the work of furthering
      the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The
      proceeds of the possessions they sold were placed at the
      disposal of the apostles (Acts 4:36, 37). Ananias might
      have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed
      agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had
      of his own accord devoted it all, as he said, to these
      sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of it for his own ends,
      and thus lied in declaring that he had given it all.
      &quot;The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt
      of God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter
      disregard of the corruption which they were bringing into
      the society. Such sin, committed in despite of the light
      which they possessed, called for a special mark of divine
      indignation.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Christian at Damascus (Acts 9:10). He became
      Paul&#39;s instructor; but when or by what means he himself
      became a Christian we have no information. He was &quot;a
      devout man according to the law, having a good report of
      all the Jews which dwelt&quot; at Damascus (22:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The high priest before whom Paul was brought in the
      procuratorship of Felix (Acts 23:2, 5, 24). He was so
      enraged at Paul&#39;s noble declaration, &quot;I have lived
      in all good conscience before God until this day,&quot;
      that he commanded one of his attendants to smite him on the
      mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked insult, Paul quickly
      replied, &quot;God shall smite thee, thou whited
      wall.&quot; Being reminded that Ananias was the high
      priest, to whose office all respect was to be paid, he
      answered, &quot;I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
      priest&quot; (Acts 23:5). This expression has occasioned
      some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul
      should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The
      expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment
      overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as
      others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had
      said, &quot;The high priest breaking the law! God&#39;s
      high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white
      robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it
      ought not to be, the voice of the high priest.&quot; (See
      Dr. Lindsay on Acts, <i>in loco</i>.) (c) Others think that
      from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the
      speaker was the high priest. In all this, however, it may
      be explained, Paul, with all his excellency, comes short of
      the example of his divine Master, who, when he was reviled,
      reviled not again.

      <a name="T0000231"><b>Anath -</b> an answer; i.e., to
      &quot;prayer&quot;, the father of Shamgar, who was one of
      the judges of Israel (Judg. 3:31).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000232"><b>Anathema -</b> anything laid up or
      suspended; hence anything laid up in a temple or set apart
      as sacred. In this sense the form of the word is <i>
      anath(ee)ma</i>, once in plural used in the Greek New
      Testament, in Luke 21:5, where it is rendered
      &quot;gifts.&quot; In the LXX. the form <i>anathema</i> is
      generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word <i>
      herem</i>, derived from a verb which means (1) to
      consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so
      devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed (Num. 18:14; Lev.
      27:28, 29); and hence the idea of exterminating connected
      with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used
      of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide
      range of application. The <i>anathema_ or _herem</i> was a
      person or thing irrevocably devoted to God (Lev. 27:21,
      28); and &quot;none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall
      surely be put to death&quot; (27:29). The word therefore
      carried the idea of devoted to destruction (Num. 21:2, 3;
      Josh. 6:17); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed.
      In Deut. 7:26 an idol is called a <i>herem</i> = <i>
      anathema</i>, a thing accursed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament this word always implies execration.
      In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on
      himself unless certain conditions are fulfilled (Acts
      23:12, 14, 21). &quot;To call Jesus accursed&quot;
      [anathema] (1 Cor. 12:3) is to pronounce him execrated or
      accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle
      says, &quot;let him be accursed&quot; (Gal. 1:8, 9); i.e.,
      let his conduct in so doing be accounted accursed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rom. 9:3, the expression &quot;accursed&quot; (anathema)
      from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance
      with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle
      here does not speak of his wish as a possible thing. It is
      simply a vehement expression of feeling, showing how strong
      was his desire for the salvation of his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anathema in 1 Cor. 16:22 denotes simply that they who
      love not the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and
      execration to all holy beings; they are guilty of a crime
      that merits the severest condemnation; they are exposed to
      the just sentence of &quot;everlasting destruction from the
      presence of the Lord.&quot;

      <a name="T0000233"><b>Anathoth -</b> the name of one of the
      cities of refuge, in the tribe of Benjamin (Josh. 21:18).
      The Jews, as a rule, did not change the names of the towns
      they found in Palestine; hence this town may be regarded as
      deriving its name from the goddess Anat. It was the native
      place of Abiezer, one of David&#39;s &quot;thirty&quot; (2
      Sam. 23:27), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men (1 Chr.
      12:3). It is chiefly notable, however, as the birth-place
      and usual residence of Jeremiah (Jer. 1:1; 11:21-23; 29:27;
      32:7-9). It suffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib,
      and only 128 men returned to it from the Exile (Neh. 7:27;
      Ezra 2:23). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem. It has
      been identified with the small and poor village of
      &#39;Anata, containing about 100 inhabitants.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000234"><b>Anchor -</b> From Acts 27:29, 30, 40,
      it would appear that the Roman vessels carried several
      anchors, which were attached to the stern as well as to the
      prow. The Roman anchor, like the modern one, had two teeth
      or flukes. In Heb. 6:19 the word is used metaphorically for
      that which supports or keeps one steadfast in the time of
      trial or of doubt. It is an emblem of hope.</a>

      earthly kings, his days are past reckoning.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000236"><b>Andrew -</b> manliness, a Greek name;
      one of the apostles of our Lord. He was of Bethsaida in
      Galilee (John 1:44), and was the brother of Simon Peter
      (Matt. 4:18; 10:2). On one occasion John the Baptist, whose
      disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, &quot;Behold
      the Lamb of God&quot; (John 1:40); and Andrew, hearing him,
      immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his
      disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the
      Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon
      to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued
      for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not
      become the stated attendants of the Lord till after
      John&#39;s imprisonment (Matt. 4:18, 19; Mark 1:16, 17).
      Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the
      confidential disciples (John 6:8; 12:22), and with Peter,
      James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding
      his future coming (Mark 13:3). He was present at the
      feeding of the five thousand (John 6:9), and he introduced
      the Greeks who desired to see Jesus (John 12:22); but of
      his subsequent history little is known. It is noteworthy
      that Andrew thrice brings others to Christ, (1) Peter; (2)
      the lad with the loaves; and (3) certain Greeks. These
      incidents may be regarded as a key to his character.</a>

    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A city of Manasseh given to the Levites of
      Kohath&#39;s family (1 Chr. 6:70).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000240"><b>Angel -</b> a word signifying, both
      in the Hebrew and Greek, a &quot;messenger,&quot; and hence
      employed to denote any agent God sends forth to execute his
      purposes. It is used of an ordinary messenger (Job 1:14: 1
      Sam. 11:3; Luke 7:24; 9:52), of prophets (Isa. 42:19; Hag.
      1:13), of priests (Mal. 2:7), and ministers of the New
      Testament (Rev. 1:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also applied to such impersonal agents as the
      pestilence (2 Sam. 24:16, 17; 2 Kings 19:35), the wind (Ps.
      104:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      But its distinctive application is to certain heavenly
      intelligences whom God employs in carrying on his
      government of the world. The name does not denote their
      nature but their office as messengers. The appearances to
      Abraham at Mamre (Gen. 18:2, 22. Comp. 19:1), to Jacob at
      Peniel (Gen. 32:24, 30), to Joshua at Gilgal (Josh. 5:13,
      15), of the Angel of the Lord, were doubtless
      manifestations of the Divine presence, &quot;foreshadowings
      of the incarnation,&quot; revelations before the
      &quot;fulness of the time&quot; of the Son of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The existence and orders of angelic beings can only be
      discovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does not
      treat of this subject specially, yet there are numerous
      incidental details that furnish us with ample information.
      Their personal existence is plainly implied in such
      passages as Gen. 16:7, 10, 11; Judg. 13:1-21; Matt. 28:2-5;
      Heb. 1:4, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      These superior beings are very numerous. &quot;Thousand
      thousands,&quot; etc. (Dan. 7:10; Matt. 26:53; Luke 2:13;
      Heb. 12:22, 23). They are also spoken of as of different
      ranks in dignity and power (Zech. 1:9, 11; Dan. 10:13;
      12:1; 1 Thess. 4:16; Jude 1:9; Eph. 1:21; Col. 1:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) As to their nature, they are spirits (Heb. 1:14), like
      the soul of man, but not incorporeal. Such expressions as
      &quot;like the angels&quot; (Luke 20:36), and the fact that
      whenever angels appeared to man it was always in a human
      form (Gen. 18:2; 19:1, 10; Luke 24:4; Acts 1:10), and the
      titles that are applied to them (&quot;sons of God,&quot;
      Job 1:6; 38:7; Dan. 3:25; comp. 28) and to men (Luke 3:38),
      seem all to indicate some resemblance between them and the
      human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as creatures
      (Job 4:18; Matt. 24:36; 1 Pet. 1:12). As finite creatures
      they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of
      &quot;fallen angels.&quot; Of the cause and manner of their
      &quot;fall&quot; we are wholly ignorant. We know only that
      &quot;they left their first estate&quot; (Matt. 25:41; Rev.
      12:7,9), and that they are &quot;reserved unto
      judgement&quot; (2 Pet. 2:4). When the manna is called
      &quot;angels&#39; food,&quot; this is merely to denote its
      excellence (Ps. 78:25). Angels never die (Luke 20:36). They
      are possessed of superhuman intelligence and power (Mark
      13:32; 2 Thess. 1:7; Ps. 103:20). They are called
      &quot;holy&quot; (Luke 9:26), &quot;elect&quot; (1 Tim.
      5:21). The redeemed in glory are &quot;like unto the
      angels&quot; (Luke 20:36). They are not to be worshipped
      (Col. 2:18; Rev. 19:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Their functions are manifold. (a) In the widest sense
      they are agents of God&#39;s providence (Ex. 12:23; Ps.
      104:4; Heb. 11:28; 1 Cor. 10:10; 2 Sam. 24:16; 1 Chr.
      21:16; 2 Kings 19:35; Acts 12:23). (b) They are specially
      God&#39;s agents in carrying on his great work of
      redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to
      man till after the call of Abraham. From that time onward
      there are frequent references to their ministry on earth
      (Gen. 18; 19; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 32:1). They appear to rebuke
      idolatry (Judg. 2:1-4), to call Gideon (Judg. 6:11, 12),
      and to consecrate Samson (13:3). In the days of the
      prophets, from Samuel downward, the angels appear only in
      their behalf (1 Kings 19:5; 2 Kings 6:17; Zech. 1-6; Dan.
      4:13, 23; 10:10, 13, 20, 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations
      of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him
      service while here. They predict his advent (Matt. 1:20;
      Luke 1:26-38), minister to him after his temptation and
      agony (Matt. 4:11; Luke 22:43), and declare his
      resurrection and ascension (Matt. 28:2-8; John 20:12, 13;
      Acts 1:10, 11). They are now ministering spirits to the
      people of God (Heb. 1:14; Ps. 34:7; 91:11; Matt. 18:10;
      Acts 5:19; 8:26; 10:3; 12:7; 27:23). They rejoice over a
      penitent sinner (Luke 15:10). They bear the souls of the
      redeemed to paradise (Luke 16:22); and they will be the
      ministers of judgement hereafter on the great day (Matt.
      13:39, 41, 49; 16:27; 24:31). The passages (Ps. 34:7, Matt.
      18:10) usually referred to in support of the idea that
      every individual has a particular guardian angel have no
      such meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the
      ministry of angels to deliver his people from affliction
      and danger, and that the angels do not think it below their
      dignity to minister even to children and to the least among
      Christ&#39;s disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;angel of his presence&quot; (Isa. 63:9. Comp. Ex.
      23:20, 21; 32:34; 33:2; Num. 20:16) is probably rightly
      interpreted of the Messiah as the guide of his people.
      Others have supposed the expression to refer to Gabriel
      (Luke 1:19).

      necessarily sinful. It may, however, become sinful when
      causeless, or excessive, or protracted (Matt. 5:22; Eph.
      4:26; Col. 3:8). As ascribed to God, it merely denotes his
      displeasure with sin and with sinners (Ps. 7:11).</a>

      clean could be offered in sacrifice and eaten. All animals
      that had not cloven hoofs and did not chew the cud were
      unclean. The list of clean and unclean quadrupeds is set
      forth in the Levitical law (Deut. 14:3-20; Lev. 11).</a>

      <a name="T0000244"><b>Anise -</b> This word is found only
      in Matt. 23:23. It is the plant commonly known by the name
      of dill, the Peucedanum graveolens of the botanist. This
      name dill is derived from a Norse word which means to
      soothe, the plant having the carminative property of
      allaying pain. The common dill, the Anethum graveolens, is
      an annual growing wild in the cornfields of Spain and
      Portugal and the south of Europe generally. There is also a
      species of dill cultivated in Eastern countries known by
      the name of shubit. It was this species of garden plant of
      which the Pharisees were in the habit of paying tithes. The
      Talmud requires that the seeds, leaves, and stem of dill
      shall pay tithes. It is an umbelliferous plant, very like
      the caraway, its leaves, which are aromatic, being used in
      soups and pickles. The proper anise is the Pimpinella
      anisum.</a>

      <a name="T0000245"><b>Anna -</b> grace, an aged widow, the
      daughter of Phanuel. She was a &quot;prophetess,&quot; like
      Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah (2 Chr. 34:22). After seven
      years of married life her husband died, and during her long
      widowhood she daily attended the temple services. When she
      was eighty-four years old, she entered the temple at the
      moment when the aged Simeon uttered his memorable words of
      praise and thanks to God that he had fulfilled his ancient
      promise in sending his Son into the world (Luke 2:36,
      37).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000246"><b>Annas -</b> was high priest A.D.
      7-14. In A.D. 25 Caiaphas, who had married the daughter of
      Annas (John 18:13), was raised to that office, and probably
      Annas was now made president of the Sanhedrim, or deputy or
      coadjutor of the high priest, and thus was also called high
      priest along with Caiaphas (Luke 3:2). By the Mosaic law
      the high-priesthood was held for life (Num. 3:10); and
      although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator,
      the Jews may still have regarded him as legally the high
      priest. Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after
      a brief questioning of him (John 18:19-23) was sent to
      Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and
      the first trial of Jesus took place (Matt. 26:57-68). This
      examination of our Lord before Annas is recorded only by
      John. Annas was president of the Sanhedrim before which
      Peter and John were brought (Acts 4:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000247"><b>Anoint -</b> The practice of
      anointing with perfumed oil was common among the Hebrews.
      (1.) The act of anointing was significant of consecration
      to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing of the high
      priest (Ex. 29:29; Lev. 4:3) and of the sacred vessels (Ex.
      30:26). The high priest and the king are thus called
      &quot;the anointed&quot; (Lev. 4:3, 5, 16; 6:20; Ps.
      132:10). Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him (1
      Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 2:4, etc.). Prophets were also anointed
      (1 Kings 19:16; 1 Chr. 16:22; Ps. 105:15). The expression,
      &quot;anoint the shield&quot; (Isa. 21:5), refers to the
      custom of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield so as to
      make it supple and fit for use in war.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Anointing was also an act of hospitality (Luke 7:38,
      46). It was the custom of the Jews in like manner to anoint
      themselves with oil, as a means of refreshing or
      invigorating their bodies (Deut. 28:40; Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam.
      14:2; Ps. 104:15, etc.). This custom is continued among the
      Arabians to the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Oil was used also for medicinal purposes. It was
      applied to the sick, and also to wounds (Ps. 109:18; Isa.
      1:6; Mark 6:13; James 5:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The bodies of the dead were sometimes anointed (Mark
      14:8; Luke 23:56).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The promised Deliverer is twice called the
      &quot;Anointed&quot; or Messiah (Ps. 2:2; Dan. 9:25, 26),
      because he was anointed with the Holy Ghost (Isa. 61:1),
      figuratively styled the &quot;oil of gladness&quot; (Ps.
      45:7; Heb. 1:9). Jesus of Nazareth is this anointed One
      (John 1:41; Acts 9:22; 17:2, 3; 18:5, 28), the Messiah of
      the Old Testament.

      <a name="T0000248"><b>Ant -</b> (Heb. nemalah, from a word
      meaning to creep, cut off, destroy), referred to in Prov.
      6:6; 30:25, as distinguished for its prudent habits. Many
      ants in Palestine feed on animal substances, but others
      draw their nourishment partly or exclusively from
      vegetables. To the latter class belongs the ant to which
      Solomon refers. This ant gathers the seeds in the season of
      ripening, and stores them for future use; a habit that has
      been observed in ants in Texas, India, and Italy.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000249"><b>Antichrist -</b> against Christ, or
      an opposition Christ, a rival Christ. The word is used only
      by the apostle John. Referring to false teachers, he says
      (1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 1:7), &quot;Even now are
      there many antichrists.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) This name has been applied to the &quot;little
      horn&quot; of the &quot;king of fierce countenance&quot;
      (Dan. 7:24, 25; 8:23-25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) It has been applied also to the &quot;false
      Christs&quot; spoken of by our Lord (Matt. 24:5, 23, 24).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) To the &quot;man of sin&quot; described by Paul (2
      Thess. 2:3, 4, 8-10).

      <a name="T0000250"><b>Antioch -</b> (1.) In Syria, on the
      river Orontes, about 16 miles from the Mediterranean, and
      some 300 miles north of Jerusalem. It was the metropolis of
      Syria, and afterwards became the capital of the Roman
      province in Asia. It ranked third, after Rome and
      Alexandria, in point of importance, of the cities of the
      Roman empire. It was called the &quot;first city of the
      East.&quot; Christianity was early introduced into it (Acts
      11:19, 21, 24), and the name &quot;Christian&quot; was
      first applied here to its professors (Acts 11:26). It is
      intimately connected with the early history of the gospel
      (Acts 6:5; 11:19, 27, 28, 30; 12:25; 15:22-35; Gal. 2:11,
      12). It was the great central point whence missionaries to
      the Gentiles were sent forth. It was the birth-place of the
      famous Christian father Chrysostom, who died A.D. 407. It
      bears the modern name of Antakia, and is now a miserable,
      decaying Turkish town. Like Philippi, it was raised to the
      rank of a Roman colony. Such colonies were ruled by
      &quot;praetors&quot; (R.V. marg., Acts 16:20, 21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) In the extreme north of Pisidia; was visited by Paul
      and Barnabas on the first missionary journey (Acts 13:14).
      Here they found a synagogue and many proselytes. They met
      with great success in preaching the gospel, but the Jews
      stirred up a violent opposition against them, and they were
      obliged to leave the place. On his return, Paul again
      visited Antioch for the purpose of confirming the disciples
      (Acts 14:21). It has been identified with the modern
      Yalobatch, lying to the east of Ephesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000251"><b>Antiochus -</b> the name of several
      Syrian kings from B.C. 280 to B.C. 65. The most notable of
      these were, (1.) Antiochus the Great, who ascended the
      throne B.C. 223. He is regarded as the &quot;king of the
      north&quot; referred to in Dan. 11:13-19. He was succeeded
      (B.C. 187) by his son, Seleucus Philopater, spoken of by
      Daniel (11:20) as &quot;a raiser of taxes&quot;, in the
      Revised Version, &quot;one that shall cause an exactor to
      pass through the glory of the kingdom.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Antiochus IV., surnamed &quot;Epiphanes&quot; i.e.,
      the Illustrious, succeeded his brother Seleucus (B.C. 175).
      His career and character are prophetically described by
      Daniel (11:21-32). He was a &quot;vile person.&quot; In a
      spirit of revenge he organized an expedition against
      Jerusalem, which he destroyed, putting vast multitudes of
      its inhabitants to death in the most cruel manner. From
      this time the Jews began the great war of independence
      under their heroic Maccabean leaders with marked success,
      defeating the armies of Antiochus that were sent against
      them. Enraged at this, Antiochus marched against them in
      person, threatening utterly to exterminate the nation; but
      on the way he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death
      (B.C. 164).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000252"><b>Antipas -</b> (1.) Herod Antipas, a
      son of Herod the Great by his Samaritan wife Malthace. He
      was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea during the whole period
      of our Lord&#39;s life on earth (Luke 23:7). He was a
      frivolous and vain prince, and was chargeable with many
      infamous crimes (Mark 8:15; Luke 3:19; 13:31, 32). He
      beheaded John the Baptist (Matt. 14:1-12) at the
      instigation of Herodias, the wife of his half-brother
      Herod-Philip, whom he had married. Pilate sent Christ to
      him when he was at Jerusalem at the Passover (Luke 23:7).
      He asked some idle questions of him, and after causing him
      to be mocked, sent him back again to Pilate. The wife of
      Chuza, his house-steward, was one of our Lord&#39;s
      disciples (Luke 8:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A &quot;faithful martyr&quot; (Rev. 2:13), of whom
      nothing more is certainly known.

      <a name="T0000253"><b>Antipatris -</b> a city built by
      Herod the Great, and called by this name in honour of his
      father, Antipater. It lay between Caesarea and Lydda, two
      miles inland, on the great Roman road from Caesarea to
      Jerusalem. To this place Paul was brought by night (Acts
      23:31) on his way to Caesarea, from which it was distant 28
      miles. It is identified with the modern, Ras-el-Ain, where

      Jerusalem, at the north-west corner of the temple area. It
      is called &quot;the castle&quot; (Acts 21:34, 37). From the
      stairs of this castle Paul delivered his famous speech to
      the multitude in the area below (Acts 22:1-21). It was
      originally a place in which were kept the vestments of the
      high priest. Herod fortified it, and called it Antonia in
      honour of his friend Mark Antony. It was of great size, and
      commanded the temple. It was built on a plateau of rock,
      separated on the north from the hill Bezetha by a ditch
      about 30 feet deep and 165 feet wide.</a>

      tribe (1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21). It was brought from
      India by the fleets of Solomon and Hiram, and was called by
      the Hebrews <i>koph_, and by the Greeks _kepos</i>, both
      words being just the Indian Tamil name of the monkey, kapi,
      i.e., swift, nimble, active. No species of ape has ever
      been found in Palestine or the adjacent regions.</a>

      (Josh. 13:4; 19:30), stronghold. (1.) A city of the tribe
      of Asher. It was the scene of the licentious worship of the
      Syrian Aphrodite. The ruins of the temple,
      &quot;magnificent ruins&quot; in a &quot;spot of strange
      wildness and beauty&quot;, are still seen at Afka, on the

      Sam. 4:1; 29:1; comp. 28:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A town on the road from Damascus to Palestine, in the
      level plain east of Jordan, near which Benhadad was
      defeated by the Israelites (1 Kings 20:26, 30; 2 Kings
      13:17). It has been identified with the modern Fik, 6 miles

      <a name="T0000263"><b>Apocrypha -</b> hidden, spurious, the
      name given to certain ancient books which found a place in
      the LXX. and Latin Vulgate versions of the Old Testament,
      and were appended to all the great translations made from
      them in the sixteenth century, but which have no claim to
      be regarded as in any sense parts of the inspired Word.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) They are not once quoted by the New Testament writers,
      who frequently quote from the LXX. Our Lord and his
      apostles confirmed by their authority the ordinary Jewish
      canon, which was the same in all respects as we now have
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) These books were written not in Hebrew but in Greek,
      and during the &quot;period of silence,&quot; from the time
      of Malachi, after which oracles and direct revelations from
      God ceased till the Christian era.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The contents of the books themselves show that they
      were no part of Scripture. The Old Testament Apocrypha
      consists of fourteen books, the chief of which are the
      Books of the Maccabees (q.v.), the Books of Esdras, the
      Book of Wisdom, the Book of Baruch, the Book of Esther,
      Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Testament Apocrypha consists of a very extensive
      literature, which bears distinct evidences of its
      non-apostolic origin, and is utterly unworthy of regard.

      <a name="T0000265"><b>Apollos -</b> a Jew &quot;born at
      Alexandria,&quot; a man well versed in the Scriptures and
      eloquent (Acts 18:24; R.V., &quot;learned&quot;). He came
      to Ephesus (about A.D. 49), where he spake
      &quot;boldly&quot; in the synagogue (18:26), although he
      did not know as yet that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah.
      Aquila and Priscilla instructed him more perfectly in
      &quot;the way of God&quot;, i.e., in the knowledge of
      Christ. He then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul
      (Acts 18:27; 19:1). He was there very useful in watering
      the good seed Paul had sown (1 Cor. 1:12), and in gaining
      many to Christ. His disciples were much attached to him (1
      Cor. 3:4-7, 22). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he wrote
      the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly
      reference to him in his letter to Titus (3:13). Some have
      supposed, although without sufficient ground, that he was
      the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.</a>

      Abaddon (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000267"><b>Apostle -</b> a person sent by
      another; a messenger; envoy. This word is once used as a
      descriptive designation of Jesus Christ, the Sent of the
      Father (Heb. 3:1; John 20:21). It is, however, generally
      used as designating the body of disciples to whom he
      intrusted the organization of his church and the
      dissemination of his gospel, &quot;the twelve,&quot; as
      they are called (Matt. 10:1-5; Mark 3:14; 6:7; Luke 6:13;
      9:1). We have four lists of the apostles, one by each of
      the synoptic evangelists (Matt. 10:2-4; Mark 3:16; Luke
      6:14), and one in the Acts (1:13). No two of these lists,
      however, perfectly coincide.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord gave them the &quot;keys of the kingdom,&quot; and
      by the gift of his Spirit fitted them to be the founders
      and governors of his church (John 14:16, 17, 26; 15:26, 27;
      16:7-15). To them, as representing his church, he gave the
      commission to &quot;preach the gospel to every
      creature&quot; (Matt. 28:18-20). After his ascension he
      communicated to them, according to his promise,
      supernatural gifts to qualify them for the discharge of
      their duties (Acts 2:4; 1 Cor. 2:16; 2:7, 10, 13; 2 Cor.
      5:20; 1 Cor. 11:2). Judas Iscariot, one of &quot;the
      twelve,&quot; fell by transgression, and Matthias was
      substituted in his place (Acts 1:21). Saul of Tarsus was
      afterwards added to their number (Acts 9:3-20; 20:4;
      26:15-18; 1 Tim. 1:12; 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke has given some account of Peter, John, and the two
      Jameses (Acts 12:2, 17; 15:13; 21:18), but beyond this we
      know nothing from authentic history of the rest of the
      original twelve. After the martyrdom of James the Greater
      (Acts 12:2), James the Less usually resided at Jerusalem,
      while Paul, &quot;the apostle of the uncircumcision,&quot;
      usually travelled as a missionary among the Gentiles (Gal.
      2:8). It was characteristic of the apostles and necessary
      (1) that they should have seen the Lord, and been able to
      testify of him and of his resurrection from personal
      knowledge (John 15:27; Acts 1:21, 22; 1 Cor. 9:1; Acts
      22:14, 15). (2.) They must have been immediately called to
      that office by Christ (Luke 6:13; Gal. 1:1). (3.) It was
      essential that they should be infallibly inspired, and thus
      secured against all error and mistake in their public
      teaching, whether by word or by writing (John 14:26; 16:13;
      1 Thess. 2:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Another qualification was the power of working
      miracles (Mark 16:20; Acts 2:43; 1 Cor. 12:8-11). The
      apostles therefore could have had no successors. They are
      the only authoritative teachers of the Christian doctrines.
      The office of an apostle ceased with its first holders.

      <a name="T0000269"><b>Apparel -</b> In Old Testament times
      the distinction between male and female attire was not very
      marked. The statute forbidding men to wear female apparel
      (Deut. 22:5) referred especially to ornaments and
      head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1) an under garment
      or tunic, which was bound by a girdle. One who had only
      this tunic on was spoken of as &quot;naked&quot; (1 Sam.
      19:24; Job 24:10; Isa. 20:2). Those in high stations
      sometimes wore two tunics, the outer being called the
      &quot;upper garment&quot; (1 Sam. 15:27; 18:4; 24:5; Job
      1:20). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment
      (&quot;mantle,&quot; Isa. 3:22; 1 Kings 19:13; 2 Kings
      2:13), a loose and flowing robe. The folds of this upper
      garment could be formed into a lap (Ruth 3:15; Ps. 79:12;
      Prov. 17:23; Luke 6:38). Generals of armies usually wore
      scarlet robes (Judg. 8:26; Nah. 2:3). A form of conspicuous
      raiment is mentioned in Luke 20:46; comp. Matt. 23:5.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests alone wore trousers. Both men and women wore
      turbans. Kings and nobles usually had a store of costly
      garments for festive occasions (Isa. 3:22; Zech. 3:4) and
      for presents (Gen. 45:22; Esther 4:4; 6:8, 11; 1 Sam. 18:4;
      2 Kings 5:5; 10:22). Prophets and ascetics wore coarse
      garments (Isa. 20:2; Zech. 13:4; Matt. 3:4).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000270"><b>Appeal -</b> a reference of any case
      from an inferior to a superior court. Moses established in
      the wilderness a series of judicatories such that appeals
      could be made from a lower to a higher (Ex. 18:13-26.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Roman law the most remarkable case of appeal is
      that of Paul from the tribunal of Festus at Caesarea to
      that of the emperor at Rome (Acts 25:11, 12, 21, 25). Paul
      availed himself of the privilege of a Roman citizen in this
      matter.

      market of Appius&quot; (Acts 28:15, R.V.), a town on the
      road, the &quot;Appian Way,&quot; from Rome to Brundusium.
      It was 43 miles from Rome. Here Paul was met by some Roman
      Christians on his way to the capital. It was natural that
      they should halt here and wait for him, because from this
      place there were two ways by which travellers might journey
      to Rome.</a>

      <a name="T0000273"><b>Apple -</b> (Heb. tappuah, meaning
      &quot;fragrance&quot;). Probably the apricot or quince is
      intended by the word, as Palestine was too hot for the
      growth of apples proper. It is enumerated among the most
      valuable trees of Palestine (Joel 1:12), and frequently
      referred to in Canticles, and noted for its beauty (2:3, 5;
      8:5). There is nothing to show that it was the &quot;tree
      of the knowledge of good and evil.&quot; Dr. Tristram has
      suggested that the apricot has better claims than any other
      fruit-tree to be the apple of Scripture. It grows to a
      height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass of glossy leaves,
      and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives out a
      delicious perfume. The &quot;apple of the eye&quot; is the
      Heb. <i>ishon</i>, meaning manikin, i.e., the pupil of the
      eye (Prov. 7:2). (Comp. the promise, Zech. 2:8; the prayer,
      Ps. 17:8; and its fulfilment, Deut. 32:10.)</a>

      &quot;brier&quot; (q.v.) in Micah 7:4, a thorny plant
      bearing fruit like the potato-apple. This shrub abounds in
      the Jordan valley. (See <a href=

      Pontus, by occupation a tent-maker, whom Paul met on his
      first visit to Corinth (Acts 18:2). Along with his wife
      Priscilla he had fled from Rome in consequence of a decree
      (A.D. 50) by Claudius commanding all Jews to leave the
      city. Paul sojourned with him at Corinth, and they wrought
      together at their common trade, making Cilician hair-cloth
      for tents. On Paul&#39;s departure from Corinth after
      eighteen months, Aquila and his wife accompanied him to
      Ephesus, where they remained, while he proceeded to Syria
      (Acts 18:18, 26). When they became Christians we are not
      informed, but in Ephesus they were (1 Cor. 16:19)
      Paul&#39;s &quot;helpers in Christ Jesus.&quot; We find
      them afterwards at Rome (Rom. 16:3), interesting themselves
      still in the cause of Christ. They are referred to some
      years after this as being at Ephesus (2 Tim. 4:19). This is

    <p>
      <a name="T0000277"><b>Arabah -</b> plain, in the Revised
      Version of 2 Kings 14:25; Josh. 3:16; 8:14; 2 Sam. 2:29;
      4:7 (in all these passages the A.V. has &quot;plain&quot;);
      Amos 6:14 (A.V. &quot;wilderness&quot;). This word is found
      in the Authorized Version only in Josh. 18:18. It denotes
      the hollow depression through which the Jordan flows from
      the Lake of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It is now called by
      the Arabs el-Ghor. But the Ghor is sometimes spoken of as
      extending 10 miles south of the Dead Sea, and thence to the
      Gulf of Akabah on the Red Sea is called the Wady
      el-Arabah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000278"><b>Arabia -</b> arid, an extensive
      region in the south-west of Asia. It is bounded on the west
      by the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea, on the south by the
      Indian Ocean, and on the east by the Persian Gulf and the
      Euphrates. It extends far into the north in barren deserts,
      meeting those of Syria and Mesopotamia. It is one of the
      few countries of the world from which the original
      inhabitants have never been expelled.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was anciently divided into three parts:, (1.) Arabia
      Felix (Happy Arabia), so called from its fertility. It
      embraced a large portion of the country now known by the
      name of Arabia. The Arabs call it Yemen. It lies between
      the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. (2.) Arabia Deserta, the
      el-Badieh or &quot;Great Wilderness&quot; of the Arabs.
      From this name is derived that which is usually given to
      the nomadic tribes which wander over this region, the
      &quot;Bedaween,&quot; or, more generally,
      &quot;Bedouin,&quot; (3.) Arabia Petraea, i.e., the Rocky
      Arabia, so called from its rocky mountains and stony
      plains. It comprehended all the north-west portion of the
      country, and is much better known to travellers than any
      other portion. This country is, however, divided by modern
      geographers into (1) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian
      Peninsula; (2) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and
      (3) Western Arabia, which includes the peninsula of Sinai
      and the Desert of Petra, originally inhabited by the
      Horites (Gen. 14:6, etc.), but in later times by the
      descendants of Esau, and known as the Land of Edom or
      Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole land appears (Gen. 10) to have been inhabited by
      a variety of tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites,
      Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites; but at length
      becoming amalgamated, they came to be known by the general
      designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is
      predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most
      developed and the richest of all the Semitic languages, and
      is of great value to the student of Hebrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In the
      days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse
      was to a considerable extent kept up with this country (1
      Kings 10:15; 2 Chr. 9:14; 17:11). Arabians were present in
      Jerusalem at Pentecost (Acts 2:11). Paul retired for a
      season into Arabia after his conversion (Gal. 1:17). This
      country is frequently referred to by the prophets (Isa.
      21:11; 42:11; Jer. 25:24, etc.)

      prisoners&quot; when they were retreating from the confines
      of Edom (Num. 21:1; 33:40; Judg. 1:16). It was finally
      subdued by Joshua (12:14).</a>

      Ram, the father of Amminadab (1 Chr. 2:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The word means high, or highlands, and as the name of a
      country denotes that elevated region extending from the
      northeast of Palestine to the Euphrates. It corresponded
      generally with the Syria and Mesopotamia of the Greeks and
      Romans. In Gen. 25:20; 31:20, 24; Deut. 26:5, the word
      &quot;Syrian&quot; is properly &quot;Aramean&quot; (R.V.,
      marg.). Damascus became at length the capital of the
      several smaller kingdoms comprehended under the designation

      land, the name of a country on one of the mountains of
      which the ark rested after the Flood subsided (Gen. 8:4).
      The &quot;mountains&quot; mentioned were probably the
      Kurdish range of South Armenia. In 2 Kings 19:37, Isa.
      37:38, the word is rendered &quot;Armenia&quot; in the
      Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, &quot;Land
      of Ararat.&quot; In Jer. 51:27, the name denotes the
      central or southern portion of Armenia. It is, however,
      generally applied to a high and almost inaccessible
      mountain which rises majestically from the plain of the
      Araxes. It has two conical peaks, about 7 miles apart, the
      one 14,300 feet and the other 10,300 feet above the level
      of the plain. Three thousand feet of the summit of the
      higher of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is
      called Kuh-i-nuh, i.e., &quot;Noah&#39;s mountain&quot;, by
      the Persians. This part of Armenia was inhabited by a
      people who spoke a language unlike any other now known,
      though it may have been related to the modern Georgian.
      About B.C. 900 they borrowed the cuneiform characters of
      Nineveh, and from this time we have inscriptions of a line
      of kings who at times contended with Assyria. At the close
      of the seventh century B.C. the kingdom of Ararat came to
      an end, and the country was occupied by a people who are
      ancestors of the Armenians of the present day.</a>

      census of the people, was stayed in his work of destruction
      near a threshing-floor belonging to Araunah which was
      situated on Mount Moriah. Araunah offered it to David as a
      free gift, together with the oxen and the threshing
      instruments; but the king insisted on purchasing it at its
      full price (2 Sam. 24:24; 1 Chr. 21:24, 25), for, according
      to the law of sacrifices, he could not offer to God what
      cost him nothing. On the same place Solomon afterwards
      erected the temple (2 Sam. 24:16; 2 Chr. 3:1). (See <a

      constellation Bootes. In the Authorized Version (Job 9:9;
      38:32) it is the rendering of the Hebrew word <i>
      &#39;ash</i>, which probably designates the constellation
      the Great Bear. This word (&#39;ash) is supposed to be
      derived from an Arabic word meaning night-watcher, because
      the Great Bear always revolves about the pole, and to our
      nothern hemisphere never sets.</a>
