      <a name="T0000300"><b>Areopagus -</b> the Latin form of the
      Greek word rendered &quot;Mars&#39; hill.&quot; But it
      denotes also the council or court of justice which met in
      the open air on the hill. It was a rocky height to the west
      of the Acropolis at Athens, on the south-east summit of
      which the council was held which was constituted by Solon,
      and consisted of nine archons or chief magistrates who were
      then in office, and the ex-archons of blameless life.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On this hill of Mars (Gr. Ares) Paul delivered his
      memorable address to the &quot;men of Athens&quot; (Acts
      17:22-31).

      <a name="T0000301"><b>Aretas -</b> the father-in-law of
      Herod Antipas, and king of Arabia Petraea. His daughter
      returned to him on the occasion of her husband&#39;s
      entering into an adulterous alliance with Herodias, the
      wife of Herod-Philip, his half-brother (Luke 3:19, 20; Mark
      6:17; Matt. 14:3). This led to a war between Aretas and
      Herod Antipas. Herod&#39;s army was wholly destroyed (A.D.
      36). Aretas, taking advantage of the complications of the
      times on account of the death of the Emperor Tiberius (A.D.
      37), took possession of Damascus (2 Cor. 11:32; comp. Acts
      9:25). At this time Paul returned to Damascus from
      Arabia.</a>

      <a name="T0000302"><b>Argob -</b> stony heap, an
      &quot;island,&quot; as it has been called, of rock about 30
      miles by 20, rising 20 or 30 feet above the table-land of
      Bashan; a region of crags and chasms wild and rugged in the
      extreme. On this &quot;island&quot; stood sixty walled
      cities, ruled over by Og. It is called Trachonitis
      (&quot;the rugged region&quot;) in the New Testament (Luke
      3:1). These cities were conquered by the Israelites (Deut.
      3:4; 1 Kings 4:13). It is now called the Lejah. Here
      &quot;sixty walled cities are still traceable in a space of
      308 square miles. The architecture is ponderous and
      massive. Solid walls 4 feet thick, and stones on one
      another without cement; the roofs enormous slabs of
      basaltic rock, like iron; the doors and gates are of stone
      18 inches thick, secured by ponderous bars. The land bears
      still the appearance of having been called the &#39;land of
      giants&#39; under the giant Og.&quot; &quot;I have more
      than once entered a deserted city in the evening, taken
      possession of a comfortable house, and spent the night in
      peace. Many of the houses in the ancient cities of Bashan
      are perfect, as if only finished yesterday. The walls are
      sound, the roofs unbroken, and even the window-shutters in
      their places. These ancient cities of Bashan probably
      contain the very oldest specimens of domestic architecture
      in the world&quot; (Porter&#39;s Giant Cities). (See <a

      of the body-guard slain with Pekahiah at Samaria (2 Kings
      15:25) by the conspirator Pekah.</a>

      of the chief men sent by Ezra to procure Levites for the
      sanctuary (Ezra 8:16).</a>

    <p>
      (2.) A symbolic name for Jerusalem (Isa. 29:1, 2, 7) as
      &quot;victorious under God,&quot; and in Ezek. 43:15, 16,
      for the altar (marg., Heb. &#39;ariel) of burnt offerings,

      Jews&quot; (Luke 23:51), the birth-place of Joseph in whose
      sepulchre our Lord was laid (Matt. 27:57, 60; John 19:38).
      It is probably the same place as Ramathaim in Ephraim, and
      the birth-place of Samuel (1 Sam. 1:1, 19). Others identify
      it with Ramleh in Dan, or Rama (q.v.) in Benjamin (Matt.
      2:18).</a>

      (1.) A king of Ellasar who was confederate with Chedorlamer
      (Gen. 14:1,9). The tablets recently discovered by Mr.
      Pinches (see CHALDEA &macr;T0000758) show the true reading
      is Eri-Aku of Larsa. This Elamite name meant &quot;servant
      of the moon-god.&quot; It was afterwards changed into
      Rimsin, &quot;Have mercy, O moon-god.&quot; (2.) Dan.
      2:14.</a>

      of Thessalonica (Acts 20:4), a companion of Paul (Acts
      19:29; 27:2). He was Paul&#39;s &quot;fellow-prisoner&quot;

      <a name="T0000309"><b>Ark -</b> Noah&#39;s ark, a building
      of gopher-wood, and covered with pitch, 300 cubits long, 50
      cubits broad, and 30 cubits high (Gen. 6:14-16); an oblong
      floating house of three stories, with a door in the side
      and a window in the roof. It was 100 years in building
      (Gen. 5:32; 7:6). It was intended to preserve certain
      persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to
      bring over the earth. It contained eight persons (Gen.
      7:13; 2 Pet. 2:5), and of all &quot;clean&quot; animals
      seven pairs, and of &quot;unclean&quot; one pair, and of
      birds seven pairs of each sort (Gen. 7:2, 3). It was in the
      form of an oblong square, with flat bottom and sloping
      roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which the race of man
      was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have been
      found existing among all nations.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ark of bulrushes in which the infant Moses was laid
      (Ex. 2:3) is called in the Hebrew <i>teebah</i>, a word
      derived from the Egyptian <i>teb</i>, meaning &quot;a
      chest.&quot; It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The
      bulrushes of which it was made were the papyrus reed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacred ark is designated by a different Hebrew word,
      <i>&#39;aron&#39;</i>, which is the common name for a chest
      or coffer used for any purpose (Gen. 50:26; 2 Kings 12:9,
      10). It is distinguished from all others by such titles as
      the &quot;ark of God&quot; (1 Sam. 3:3), &quot;ark of the
      covenant&quot; (Josh. 3:6; Heb. 9:4), &quot;ark of the
      testimony&quot; (Ex. 25:22). It was made of acacia or
      shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two
      cubits long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its
      upper surface or lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a
      rim of gold; and on each of the two sides were two gold
      rings, in which were placed two gold-covered poles by which
      the ark could be carried (Num. 7:9; 10:21; 4:5,19, 20; 1
      Kings 8:3, 6). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were
      two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other
      (Lev. 16:2; Num. 7:89). Their outspread wings over the top
      of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself
      was his footstool (Ex. 25:10-22; 37:1-9). The ark was
      deposited in the &quot;holy of holies,&quot; and was so
      placed that one end of the poles by which it was carried
      touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the
      tabernacle (1 Kings 8:8). The two tables of stone which
      constituted the &quot;testimony&quot; or evidence of
      God&#39;s covenant with the people (Deut. 31:26), the
      &quot;pot of manna&quot; (Ex. 16:33), and &quot;Aaron&#39;s
      rod that budded&quot; (Num. 17:10), were laid up in the ark
      (Heb. 9:4). (See TABERNACLE &macr;T0003559) The ark and the
      sanctuary were &quot;the beauty of Israel&quot; (Lam. 2:1).
      During the journeys of the Israelites the ark was carried
      by the priests in advance of the host (Num. 4:5, 6;
      10:33-36; Ps. 68:1; 132:8). It was borne by the priests
      into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, opening a
      pathway for the whole of the host to pass over (Josh. 3:15,
      16; 4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18). It was borne in the procession
      round Jericho (Josh. 6:4, 6, 8, 11, 12). When carried it
      was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers&#39; skins, and
      blue cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of
      the Levites who carried it. After the settlement of Israel
      in Palestine the ark remained in the tabernacle at Gilgal
      for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh till the time
      of Eli, between 300 and 400 years (Jer. 7:12), when it was
      carried into the field of battle so as to secure, as they
      supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and was taken by the
      Philistines (1 Sam. 4:3-11), who sent it back after
      retaining it seven months (1 Sam. 5:7, 8). It remained then
      at Kirjath-jearim (7:1,2) till the time of David (twenty
      years), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the
      proper mode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was
      smitten with death for putting &quot;forth his hand to the
      ark of God,&quot; and in consequence of this it was left in
      the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months (2
      Sam. 6:1-11), at the end of which time David removed it in
      a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a
      place was prepared for it (12-19). It was afterwards
      deposited by Solomon in the temple (1 Kings 8:6-9). When
      the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the
      temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar
      and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found.
      The absence of the ark from the second temple was one of
      the points in which it was inferior to the first temple.

      day of God Almighty&quot; (ver. 14) shall be fought. The
      word properly means the &quot;mount of Megiddo.&quot; It is
      the scene of the final conflict between Christ and
      Antichrist. The idea of such a scene was suggested by the

      Here the ark of Noah rested after the Deluge (Gen. 8:4). It
      is for the most part high table-land, and is watered by the
      Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and the Tigris. Ararat was
      properly the name of a part of ancient Armenia. Three
      provinces of Armenia are mentioned in Jer. 51:27, Ararat,
      Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some, however, think Minni a
      contraction for Armenia. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000314"><b>Armoni -</b> inhabitant of a
      fortress, the first-named of the two sons of Saul and
      Rizpah. He was delivered up to the Gibeonites by David, and

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000315"><b>Armour -</b> is employed in the
      English Bible to denote military equipment, both offensive
      and defensive.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The offensive weapons were different at different
      periods of history. The &quot;rod of iron&quot; (Ps. 2:9)
      is supposed to mean a mace or crowbar, an instrument of
      great power when used by a strong arm. The &quot;maul&quot;
      (Prov. 25:18; cognate Hebrew word rendered
      &quot;battle-axe&quot; in Jer. 51:20, and &quot;slaughter
      weapon&quot; in Ezek. 9:2) was a war-hammer or martel. The
      &quot;sword&quot; is the usual translation of <i>hereb</i>,
      which properly means &quot;poniard.&quot; The real sword,
      as well as the dirk-sword (which was always double-edged),
      was also used (1 Sam. 17:39; 2 Sam. 20:8; 1 Kings 20:11).
      The spear was another offensive weapon (Josh. 8:18; 1 Sam.
      17:7). The javelin was used by light troops (Num. 25:7, 8;
      1 Sam. 13:22). Saul threw a javelin at David (1 Sam. 19:9,
      10), and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The
      bow was, however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows
      were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till
      the moment of action (Gen. 27:3; 48:22; Ps. 18:34). The
      sling was a favourite weapon of the Benjamites (1 Sam.
      17:40; 1 Chr. 12:2. Comp. 1 Sam. 25:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to
      the shield or buckler. There were the great shield or
      target (the <i>tzinnah</i>), for the protection of the
      whole person (Gen. 15:1; Ps. 47:9; 1 Sam. 17:7; Prov.
      30:5), and the buckler (Heb. <i>mageen</i>) or small shield
      (1 Kings 10:17; Ezek. 26:8). In Ps. 91:4
      &quot;buckler&quot; is properly a roundel appropriated to
      archers or slingers. The helmet (Ezek. 27:10; 1 Sam.
      17:38), a covering for the head; the coat of mail or
      corselet (1 Sam. 17:5), or habergeon (Neh. 4;16), harness
      or breat-plate (Rev. 9:9), for the covering of the back and
      breast and both upper arms (Isa. 59:17; Eph. 6:14). The
      cuirass and corselet, composed of leather or quilted cloth,
      were also for the covering of the body. Greaves, for the
      covering of the legs, were worn in the time of David (1
      Sam. 17:6). Reference is made by Paul (Eph. 6:14-17) to the
      panoply of a Roman soldier. The shield here is the thureon,
      a door-like oblong shield above all, i.e., covering the
      whole person, not the small round shield. There is no
      armour for the back, but only for the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000316"><b>Armour-bearer -</b> an officer
      selected by kings and generals because of his bravery, not
      only to bear their armour, but also to stand by them in the
      time of danger. They were the adjutants of our modern
      armies (Judg. 9:54; 1 Sam. 14:7; 16:21; 31:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000317"><b>Armoury -</b> the place in which
      armour was deposited when not used (Neh. 3:19; Jer. 50:25).
      At first each man of the Hebrews had his own arms, because
      all went to war. There were no arsenals or magazines for
      arms till the time of David, who had a large collection of
      arms, which he consecrated to the Lord in his tabernacle (1
      Sa,. 21:9; 2 Sam. 8:7-12; 1 Chr. 26:26, 27).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000318"><b>Army -</b> The Israelites marched out
      of Egypt in military order (Ex. 13:18,
      &quot;harnessed;&quot; marg., &quot;five in a rank&quot;).
      Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner and
      leader (Num. 2:2; 10:14). In war the army was divided into
      thousands and hundreds under their several captains (Num.
      31:14), and also into families (Num. 2:34; 2 Chr. 25:5;
      26:12). From the time of their entering the land of Canaan
      to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little
      progress in military affairs, although often engaged in
      warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a
      bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., &quot;heroes&quot;), and
      thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an
      army of 3,000 select warriors (1 Sam. 13:2; 14:52; 24:2).
      David also had a band of soldiers around him (1 Sam. 23:13;
      25:13). To this band he afterwards added the Cherethites
      and the Pelethites (2 Sam. 15:18; 20:7). At first the army
      consisted only of infantry (1 Sam. 4:10; 15:4), as the use
      of horses was prohibited (Deut. 17:16); but chariots and
      horses were afterwards added (2 Sam. 8:4; 1 Kings 10:26,
      28, 29; 1 Kings 9:19). In 1 Kings 9:22 there is given a
      list of the various gradations of rank held by those who
      composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the
      army were at the public expense (2 Sam. 17:28, 29; 1 Kings
      4:27; 10:16, 17; Judg. 20:10). At the Exodus the number of
      males above twenty years capable of bearing arms was
      600,000 (Ex. 12:37). In David&#39;s time it mounted to the
      number of 1,300,000 (2 Sam. 24:9).</a>

      boundary of the territory of Israel beyond Jordan,
      separating it from the land of Moab (Deut. 3:8, 16). This
      river (referred to twenty-four times in the Bible) rises in
      the mountains of Gilead, and after a circuitous course of
      about 80 miles through a deep ravine it falls into the Dead
      Sea nearly opposite Engedi. The stream is almost dry in
      summer. It is now called el-Mujeb. The territory of the

    <p>
      (2.) One of the towns built by the tribe of Gad (Num.
      32:34) &quot;before Rabbah&quot; (Josh. 13:25), the
      Ammonite capital. It was famous in the history of Jephthah
      (Judg. 11:33) and of David (2 Sam. 24:5). (Comp. Isa. 17:2;
      2 Kings 15:29.)

    <p>
      (3.) A city in the south of Judah, 12 miles south-east of
      Beersheba, to which David sent presents after recovering
      the spoil from the Amalekites at Ziklag (1 Sam. 30:26, 28).
      It was the native city of two of David&#39;s warriors (1
      Chr. 11:44). It is now called Ar&#39;arah.

      along with which it is invariably mentioned (2 Kings 19:13;
      18:34; Isa. 10:9), and Damascus (Jer. 49:23). After a siege

      (Gen. 11:10-13; 1 Chr. 1:17, 18; Luke 3:36). He dwelt in
      Mesopotamia, and became, according to the Jewish historian
      Josephus, the progenitor of the Chaldeans. The tendency is
      to recognize in the word the name of the country nearest
      the ancient domain of the Chaldeans. Some regard the word
      as an Egypticized form of the territorial name of Ur
      Kasdim, or Ur of the Chaldees.</a>

      18:14; 144:6; Zech. 9:14). They were used in war as well as
      in the chase (Gen. 27:3; 49:23). They were also used in
      divination (Ezek. 21:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The word is frequently employed as a symbol of calamity or
      disease inflicted by God (Job 6:4; 34:6; Ps. 38:2; Deut.
      32:23. Comp. Ezek. 5:16), or of some sudden danger (Ps.

      probably the Smerdis of profane history.</a>

      (2.) The king mentioned in Ezra 7:1, in the seventh year
      (B.C. 458) of whose reign Ezra led a second colony of Jews
      back to Jerusalem, was probably Longimanus, who reigned for
      forty years (B.C. 464-425); the grandson of Darius, who,
      fourteen years later, permitted Nehemiah to return and
      rebuild Jerusalem.

      was zealous in maintaining the true worship of God, and in
      rooting all idolatry, with its accompanying immoralities,
      out of the land (1 Kings 15:8-14). The Lord gave him and
      his land rest and prosperity. It is recorded of him,
      however, that in his old age, when afflicted, he
      &quot;sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians&quot;
      (comp. Jer. 17:5). He died in the forty-first year of his

      was put to death by Abner, whom he pursued from the field
      of battle (2 Sam. 2:18, 19). He is mentioned among
      David&#39;s thirty mighty men (2 Sam. 23:24; 1 Chr. 11:26).

      him. He is mentioned along with David as skilled in music,
      and a &quot;seer&quot; (2 Chr. 29:30). The &quot;sons of
      Asaph,&quot; mentioned in 1 Chr. 25:1, 2 Chr. 20:14, and

      city (Josh. 15:47), about midway between Gaza and Joppa,
      and 3 miles from the Mediterranean. It was one of the chief
      seats of the worship of Dagon (1 Sam. 5:5). It belonged to
      the tribe of Judah (Josh. 15:47), but it never came into
      their actual possession. It was an important city, as it
      stood on the highroad from Egypt to Palestine, and hence
      was strongly fortified (2 Chr. 26:6; Isa. 20:1). Uzziah
      took it, but fifty years after his death it was taken by
      the Assyrians (B.C. 758). According to Sargon&#39;s record,
      it was captured by him in B.C. 711. The only reference to
      it in the New Testament, where it is called Azotus, is in
      the account of Philip&#39;s return from Gaza (Acts 8:40).

      &quot;springs of Pisgah.&quot; The name Ashdoth is
      translated &quot;springs&quot; in the Authorized Version,
      but &quot;slopes&quot; in the Revised Version, of Josh.
      10:40 and 12:8. It has been identified with the springs

      son; his mother was Zilpah, Leah&#39;s handmaid (Gen.

      beyond its holding a place in the list of the tribes
      (35:26; 46:17; Ex. 1:4, etc.) It increased in numbers
      twenty-nine percent, during the thirty-eight years&#39;
      wanderings. The place of this tribe during the march
      through the desert was between Dan and Naphtali (Num.
      2:27). The boundaries of the inheritance given to it, which
      contained some of the richest soil in Palestine, and the
      names of its towns, are recorded in Josh. 19:24-31; Judg.
      1:31, 32. Asher and Simeon were the only tribes west of the
      Jordan which furnished no hero or judge for the nation.

      Revised Version, instead of &quot;grove&quot; and
      &quot;groves&quot; of the Authorized Version. This was the
      name of a sensual Canaanitish goddess Astarte, the feminine
      of the Assyrian Ishtar. Its symbol was the stem of a tree
      deprived of its boughs, and rudely shaped into an image,
      and planted in the ground. Such religious symbols
      (&quot;groves&quot;) are frequently alluded to in Scripture
      (Ex. 34:13; Judg. 6:25; 2 Kings 23:6; 1 Kings 16:33, etc.).
      These images were also sometimes made of silver or of
      carved stone (2 Kings 21:7; &quot;the graven image of

      To cover the head with ashes was a token of self-abhorrence

    </p>
    <p>
      To feed on ashes (Isa. 44:20), means to seek that which
      will prove to be vain and unsatisfactory, and hence it
      denotes the unsatisfactory nature of idol-worship. (Comp.

      Sam. 6:17). It stood on the shore of the Mediterranean, 12
      miles north of Gaza. It is mentioned on an inscription at
      Karnak in Egypt as having been taken by king Rameses II.,
      the oppressor of the Hebrews. In the time of the judges
      (Judg. 1:18) it fell into the possession of the tribe of
      Judah; but it was soon after retaken by the Philistines (2
      Sam. 1:20), who were not finally dispossessed till the time
      of Alexander the Great. Samson went down to this place from
      Timnath, and slew thirty men and took their spoil. The
      prophets foretold its destruction (Jer. 25:20; 47:5, 7). It
      became a noted place in the Middle Ages, having been the
      scene of many a bloody battle between the Saracens and the
      Crusaders. It was beseiged and taken by Richard the
      Lion-hearted, and &quot;within its walls and towers now
      standing he held his court.&quot; Among the Tell Amarna
      tablets (see EGYPT &macr;T0001137) are found letters or
      official despatches from Yadaya, &quot;captain of horse and
      dust of the king&#39;s feet,&quot; to the &quot;great

      Minni and Ararat, and hence their original seat must have
      been in Armenia (Jer. 51:27), probably near the Black Sea,

      Levitical city was given to the Gershonites (1 Chr. 6:71).
      Uzzia, one of David&#39;s valiant men (1 Chr. 11:44), is
      named as of this city. It is identified with Tell Ashterah,
      in the Hauran, and is noticed on monuments B.C. 1700-1500.
      The name Beesh-terah (Josh. 21:27) is a contraction for

      be identified with Ashtaroth preceding; called
      &quot;Karnaim&quot;, i.e., the &quot;two-horned&quot; (the
      crescent moon). The Samaritan version renders the word by
      &quot;Sunamein,&quot; the present es-Sunamein, 28 miles

      <a name="T0000344"><b>Ashtoreth -</b> the moon goddess of
      the Phoenicians, representing the passive principle in
      nature, their principal female deity; frequently associated
      with the name of Baal, the sun-god, their chief male deity
      (Judg. 10:6; 1 Sam. 7:4; 12:10). These names often occur in
      the plural (Ashtaroth, Baalim), probably as indicating
      either different statues or different modifications of the
      deities. This deity is spoken of as Ashtoreth of the
      Zidonians. She was the Ishtar of the Accadians and the
      Astarte of the Greeks (Jer. 44:17; 1 Kings 11:5, 33; 2
      Kings 23:13). There was a temple of this goddess among the
      Philistines in the time of Saul (1 Sam. 31:10). Under the
      name of Ishtar, she was one of the great deities of the
      Assyrians. The Phoenicians called her Astarte. Solomon
      introduced the worship of this idol (1 Kings 11:33).
      Jezebel&#39;s 400 priests were probably employed in its
      service (1 Kings 18:19). It was called the &quot;queen of

      etc., and probably Asia Minor in Acts 19:26, 27; 21:27;
      24:18; 27:2. Proconsular Asia contained the seven churches
      of the Apocalypse (Rev. 1:11). The &quot;chiefs of
      Asia&quot; (Acts 19:31) were certain wealthy citizens who
      were annually elected to preside over the games and
      religious festivals of the several cities to which they

      &quot;luxurious, ambitious, and cruel, but a magnificent
      patron of literature.&quot; He formed at Nineveh a library
      of clay tablets, numbering about 10,000. These are now

      Assur-bani-pal was a munificent patron of literature, and
      the conqueror of Elam. Towards the middle of his reign his
      empire was shaken by a great rebellion headed by his
      brother in Babylon. The rebellion was finally put down, but
      Egypt was lost, and the military power of Assyria was so

      <a name="T0000349"><b>Ass -</b> frequently mentioned
      throughout Scripture. Of the domesticated species we read
      of, (1.) The she ass (Heb. &#39;athon), so named from its
      slowness (Gen. 12:16; 45:23; Num. 22:23; 1 Sam. 9:3). (2.)
      The male ass (Heb. hamor), the common working ass of
      Western Asia, so called from its red colour. Issachar is
      compared to a strong ass (Gen. 49:14). It was forbidden to
      yoke together an ass and an ox in the plough (Deut. 22:10).
      (3.) The ass&#39;s colt (Heb. &#39;air), mentioned Judg.
      10:4; 12:14. It is rendered &quot;foal&quot; in Gen. 32:15;
      49:11. (Comp. Job 11:12; Isa. 30:6.) The ass is an unclean
      animal, because it does not chew the cud (Lev. 11:26. Comp.
      2 Kings 6:25). Asses constituted a considerable portion of
      wealth in ancient times (Gen. 12:16; 30:43; 1 Chr. 27:30;
      Job 1:3; 42:12). They were noted for their spirit and their
      attachment to their master (Isa. 1:3). They are frequently
      spoken of as having been ridden upon, as by Abraham (Gen.
      22:3), Balaam (Num. 22:21), the disobedient prophet (1
      Kings 13:23), the family of Abdon the judge, seventy in
      number (Judg. 12:14), Zipporah (Ex. 4:20), the Shunammite
      (1 Sam. 25:30), etc. Zechariah (9:9) predicted our
      Lord&#39;s triumphal entrance into Jerusalem, &quot;riding
      upon an ass, and upon a colt,&quot; etc. (Matt. 21:5,
      R.V.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of wild asses two species are noticed, (1) that called in
      Hebrew <i>&#39;arod</i>, mentioned Job 39:5 and Dan. 5:21,
      noted for its swiftness; and (2) that called <i>
      pe&#39;re</i>, the wild ass of Asia (Job 39:6-8; 6:5;
      11:12; Isa. 32:14; Jer. 2:24; 14:6, etc.). The wild ass was
      distinguished for its fleetness and its extreme shyness. In
      allusion to his mode of life, Ishmael is likened to a wild
      ass (Gen. 16:12. Here the word is simply rendered
      &quot;wild&quot; in the Authorized Version, but in the
      Revised Version, &quot;wild-ass among men&quot;).

      built Nineveh, etc. (Gen. 10:11,12). He probably gave his
      name to Assyria, which is the usual translation of the
      word, although the form Asshur is sometimes retained (Num.
      24:22, 24; Ezek. 27:23, etc.). In Gen. 2:14
      &quot;Assyria&quot; ought to be &quot;Asshur,&quot; which
      was the original capital of Assyria, a city represented by
      the mounds of Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the
      Tigris. This city was founded by Bel-kap-kapu about B.C.
      1700. At a later date the capital was shifted to Ninua, or
      Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river.

      shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium. Paul came hither on foot
      along the Roman road from Troas (Acts 20:13, 14), a

      <a name="T0000352"><b>Assurance -</b> The resurrection of
      Jesus (Acts 17:31) is the &quot;assurance&quot; (Gr.
      pistis, generally rendered &quot;faith&quot;) or pledge God
      has given that his revelation is true and worthy of
      acceptance. The &quot;full assurance [Gr. plerophoria,
      &#39;full bearing&#39;] of faith&quot; (Heb. 10:22) is a
      fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The
      &quot;full assurance of understanding&quot; (Col. 2:2) is
      an entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the
      declarations of Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the
      part of any one of conviction that he has grasped the very
      truth. The &quot;full assurance of hope&quot; (Heb. 6:11)
      is a sure and well-grounded expectation of eternal glory (2
      Tim. 4:7, 8). This assurance of hope is the assurance of a
      man&#39;s own particular salvation.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This infallible assurance, which believers may attain unto
      as to their own personal salvation, is founded on the truth
      of the promises (Heb. 6:18), on the inward evidence of
      Christian graces, and on the testimony of the Spirit of
      adoption (Rom. 8:16). That such a certainty may be attained
      appears from the testimony of Scripture (Rom. 8:16; 1 John
      2:3; 3:14), from the command to seek after it (Heb. 6:11; 2
      Pet. 1:10), and from the fact that it has been attained (2
      Tim. 1:12; 4:7, 8; 1 John 2:3; 4:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      This full assurance is not of the essence of saving faith.
      It is the result of faith, and posterior to it in the order
      of nature, and so frequently also in the order of time.
      True believers may be destitute of it. Trust itself is
      something different from the evidence that we do trust.
      Believers, moreover, are exhorted to go on to something
      beyond what they at present have when they are exhorted to
      seek the grace of full assurance (Heb. 10:22; 2 Pet.
      1:5-10). The attainment of this grace is a duty, and is to
      be diligently sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and
      abiding peace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God;
      and these from the very laws of our being to greater
      buoyancy, strength, and cheerfulness in the practice of
      obedience in every department of duty.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This assurance may in various ways be shaken, diminished,
      and intermitted, but the principle out of which it springs
      can never be lost. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000353"><b>Assyria -</b> the name derived from
      the city Asshur on the Tigris, the original capital of the
      country, was originally a colony from Babylonia, and was
      ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It was a mountainous
      region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the
      Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the
      Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C.
      1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a
      conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian
      masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The
      Assyrians were Semites (Gen. 10:22), but in process of time
      non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a
      military people, the &quot;Romans of the East.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is
      positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the
      greatest of the Assyrian kings, &quot;crossed the
      Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the
      city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of
      the Mediterranean.&quot; He may be regarded as the founder
      of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians
      gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of
      Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel,
      Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states,
      whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar.
      This led to Ahab&#39;s casting off the yoke of Damascus and
      allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the
      Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of
      Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought
      under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was
      seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the
      name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into
      Syria, which had by this time regained its independence,
      and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of
      three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an
      ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by
      Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul
      invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute (2 Kings
      15:19). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war
      against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this
      Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver (2
      Kings 16:8); who accordingly &quot;marched against
      Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the
      city itself.&quot; Leaving a portion of his army to
      continue the siege, &quot;he advanced through the province
      east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,&quot; and became
      master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died
      B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled
      till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria (2 Kings 17:5), but
      was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or
      commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.)
      after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the
      kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity,
      B.C. 722 (2 Kings 17:1-6, 24; 18:7, 9). He also overran the
      land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem (Isa. 10:6,
      12, 22, 24, 34). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C.
      705), the son and successor of Sargon (2 Kings 18:13;
      19:37; Isa. 7:17, 18); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and
      successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and
      kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he
      alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his
      government (2 Kings 19:37; Isa. 37:38).
    </p>
    <p>
      Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in
      Ezra 4:10 is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period
      Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having
      absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and
      Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory,
      and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its
      power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the
      rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful
      Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan (2 Kings 20:12), who,
      after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited
      the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death
      the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and
      the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their
      independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the
      prophecies of Isaiah (10:5-19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah
      (3:13), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was
      composed ceased to recognize the &quot;great king&quot; (2
      Kings 18:19; Isa. 36:4). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C.
      586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be
      a nation. (See NINEVEH &macr;T0002735; <a href=

      are distinguished and named. Mention is made of the

      The oldest divisions of time were mainly based on the

      &quot;ordinances of heaven&quot; (Gen. 1:14-18; Job 38:33;
      Jer. 31:35; 33:25). Such observations led to the division
      of the year into months and the mapping out of the
      appearances of the stars into twelve portions, which
      received from the Greeks the name of the
      &quot;zodiac.&quot; The word &quot;Mazzaroth&quot; (Job
      38:32) means, as the margin notes, &quot;the twelve
      signs&quot; of the zodiac. Astronomical observations were
      also necessary among the Jews in order to the fixing of the
      proper time for sacred ceremonies, the &quot;new
      moons,&quot; the &quot;passover,&quot; etc. Many allusions
      are found to the display of God&#39;s wisdom and power as

      The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the

      atonement is reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the

      But the word is also used to denote that by which this

      sense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction
      for his offences (Ex. 32:30; Lev. 4:26; 5:16; Num. 6:11),

    <p>
      By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by
      which he expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word
      denotes the reconciliation itself, and not the means by
      which it is effected. When speaking of Christ&#39;s saving
      work, the word &quot;satisfaction,&quot; the word used by
      the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to
      the word &quot;atonement.&quot; Christ&#39;s satisfaction
      is all he did in the room and in behalf of sinners to
      satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God.
      Christ&#39;s work consisted of suffering and obedience, and
      these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our
      benefit, but were in our stead, as the suffering and
      obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is
      expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus
      God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with
      his justice to manifest his love to transgressors.
      Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it is covered. The
      means by which it is covered is vicarious satisfaction, and
      the result of its being covered is atonement or
      reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue
      of which alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought
      about. Christ&#39;s mediatorial work and sufferings are the
      ground or efficient cause of reconciliation with God. They
      rectify the disturbed relations between God and man, taking
      away the obstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship
      and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not
      only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently
      that of God toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he
      himself provided, so that consistently with the other
      attributes of his character his love might flow forth in
      all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea
      presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture
      is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite
      worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.), and
      accepted by him in room of the very penalty man had
      incurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that the
      atonement is not the cause but the consequence of God&#39;s
      love to guilty men (John 3:16; Rom. 3:24, 25; Eph. 1:7; 1
      John 1:9; 4:9). The atonement may also be regarded as
      necessary, not in an absolute but in a relative sense,
      i.e., if man is to be saved, there is no other way than
      this which God has devised and carried out (Ex. 34:7; Josh.
      24:19; Ps. 5:4; 7:11; Nahum 1:2, 6; Rom. 3:5). This is
      God&#39;s plan, clearly revealed; and that is enough for us
      to know.

      &quot;all the world should be taxed&quot; was the divinely
      ordered occasion of Jesus&#39; being born, according to
      prophecy (Micah 5:2), in Bethlehem. This name being simply
      a title meaning &quot;majesty&quot; or
      &quot;venerable,&quot; first given to him by the senate
      (B.C. 27), was borne by succeeding emperors. Before his

      from verb gaal, &quot;to be near of kin,&quot; &quot;to

      It was his right and duty to slay the murderer (2 Sam.
      14:7, 11) if he found him outside of a city of refuge. In
      order that this law might be guarded against abuse, Moses
      appointed six cities of refuge (Ex. 21:13; Num. 35:13;
      Deut. 19:1,9). These were in different parts of the
      country, and every facility was afforded the manslayer that
      he might flee to the city that lay nearest him for safety.
      Into the city of refuge the avenger durst not follow him.
      This arrangement applied only to cases where the death was
      not premeditated. The case had to be investigated by the
      authorities of the city, and the wilful murderer was on no
      account to be spared. He was regarded as an impure and
      polluted person, and was delivered up to the <i>goel</i>
      (Deut. 19:11-13). If the offence was merely manslaughter,
      then the fugitive must remain within the city till the
      death of the high priest (Num. 35:25).</a>

      10:34) and hewing timber for building. It is the rendering
      of a different word in Judg. 9:48, 1 Sam. 13:20, 21, Ps.
      74:5, which refers to its sharpness. In 2 Kings 6:5 it is
      the translation of a word used with reference to its being
      made of iron. In Isa. 44:12 the Revised Version renders by
      &quot;axe&quot; the Hebrew <i>maatsad</i>, which means a
      &quot;hewing&quot; instrument. In the Authorized Version it
      is rendered &quot;tongs.&quot; It is also used in Jer.
      10:3, and rendered &quot;axe.&quot; The
      &quot;battle-axe&quot; (army of Medes and Persians)
      mentioned in Jer. 51:20 was probably, as noted in the
      margin of the Revised Version, a &quot;maul&quot; or heavy
      mace. In Ps. 74:6 the word so rendered means

      <a name="T0000374"><b>Azazel -</b> (Lev. 16:8, 10, 26,
      Revised Version only here; rendered &quot;scape-goat&quot;
      in the Authorized Version). This word has given rise to
      many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as
      the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the
      wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil
      spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two
      goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord
      &quot;laid the iniquity of us all,&quot; and examine into
      the root meaning of this word (viz.,
      &quot;separation&quot;), the interpretation of those who
      regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and
      the other, that &quot;for Azazel,&quot; as representing the
      effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete
      removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat
      which was &quot;for Jehovah&quot; was offered as a
      sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins
      must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were
      symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which
      was then &quot;sent away for Azazel&quot; into the
      wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and
      therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was
      wholly carried away. It was important that the result of
      the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the
      sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and
      hence the dismissal of the &quot;scape-goat.&quot; It was
      of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of
      the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness
      bearing away sin. As the goat &quot;for Jehovah&quot; was
      to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood
      of atonement, so the goat &quot;for Azazel&quot; was to
      witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of
      the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin.</a>

      identified with Molech (Jer. 19:5). It was known to the
      Israelites as Baal-peor (Num. 25:3; Deut. 4:3), was
      worshipped till the time of Samuel (1 Sam 7:4), and was
      afterwards the religion of the ten tribes in the time of
      Ahab (1 Kings 16:31-33; 18:19, 22). It prevailed also for a

      16:3; 2 Chr. 28:2), till finally put an end to by the

      of various classes (2 Kings 10:19). Their mode of offering
      sacrifices is described in 1 Kings 18:25-29. The sun-god,
