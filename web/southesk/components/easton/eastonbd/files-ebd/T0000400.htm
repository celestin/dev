      <a name="T0000400"><b>Baal-shalisha -</b> lord of Shalisha,
      a place from which a man came with provisions for Elisha,
      apparently not far from Gilgal (2 Kings 4:42). It has been
      identified with Sirisia, 13 miles north of Lydda.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000401"><b>Baal-tamar -</b> lord of palm trees,
      a place in the tribe of Benjamin near Gibeah of Saul (Judg.
      20:33). It was one of the sanctuaries or groves of Baal.
      Probably the palm tree of Deborah (Judg. 4:5) is alluded to
      in the name.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000402"><b>Baal-zebub -</b> fly-lord, the god of
      the Philistines at Ekron (2 Kings 1:2, 3, 16). This name
      was given to the god because he was supposed to be able to
      avert the plague of flies which in that region was to be
      feared. He was consulted by Ahaziah as to his recovery.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000403"><b>Baal-zephon -</b> Baal of the north,
      an Egyptian town on the shores of the Gulf of Suez (Ex.
      14:2; Num. 33:7), over against which the children of Israel
      encamped before they crossed the Red Sea. It is probably to
      be identified with the modern Jebel Deraj or Kulalah, on
      the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Baal-zapuna of the
      Egyptians was a place of worship.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000404"><b>Baana -</b> son of affliction. (1.)
      One of Solomon&#39;s purveyors (1 Kings 4:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Son of Hushai, another of Solomon&#39;s purveyors (1
      Kings 4:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Father of Zadok (Neh. 3:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000405"><b>Baanah -</b> son of affliction. (1.)
      One of the two sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, a captain in
      Saul&#39;s army. He and his brother Rechab assassinated
      Ishbosheth (2 Sam. 4:2), and were on this account slain by
      David, and their mutilated bodies suspended over the pool
      at Hebron (5, 6, 12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The father of Heled, who was one of David&#39;s thirty
      heroes (2 Sam. 23:29; 1 Chr. 11:30).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000406"><b>Baasha -</b> bravery, the third king
      of the separate kingdom of Israel, and founder of its
      second dynasty (1 Kings 15; 16; 2 Chr. 16:1-6). He was the
      son of Ahijah of the tribe of Issachar. The city of Tirzah
      he made the capital of his kingdom, and there he was
      buried, after an eventful reign of twenty-four years (1
      Kings 15:33). On account of his idolatries his family was
      exterminated, according to the word of the prophet Jehu (1
      Kings 16:3, 4, 10-13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000407"><b>Babe -</b> used of children generally
      (Matt. 11:25; 21:16; Luke 10:21; Rom. 2:20). It is used
      also of those who are weak in Christian faith and knowledge
      (1 Cor. 3:1; Heb. 5:13; 1 Pet. 2:2). In Isa. 3:4 the word
      &quot;babes&quot; refers to a succession of weak and wicked
      princes who reigned over Judah from the death of Josiah
      downward to the destruction of Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000408"><b>Babel, tower of -</b> the name given
      to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built
      in the land of Shinar after the Deluge (Gen. 11:1-9). Their
      object in building this tower was probably that it might be
      seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar,
      to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia,
      and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God
      interposed and defeated their design by condounding their
      language, and hence the name Babel, meaning
      &quot;confusion.&quot; In the Babylonian tablets there is
      an account of this event, and also of the creation and the
      deluge. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000700.html&amp;from=T0000758&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">

      The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site,
      is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple
      of great extent and magnificence, erected by the
      Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures
      Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this
      temple (2 Chr. 36:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles
      south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part
      of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the
      Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted
      fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising
      suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain,
      and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower
      of Babel. This is &quot;one of the most imposing ruins in
      the country.&quot; Others think it to be the ruins of the
      Temple of Belus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000409"><b>Babylon -</b> the Greek form of
      BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning &quot;The Gate of
      God.&quot; In the Assyrian tablets it means &quot;The city
      of the dispersion of the tribes.&quot; The monumental list
      of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes
      Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of
      Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above
      its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its
      midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The
      Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or
      Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into
      one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi
      delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new
      empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the
      united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and
      grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to
      Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the
      Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing
      Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of
      the most splendid cities of the ancient world.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing through various vicissitudes the city was
      occupied by Cyrus, &quot;king of Elam,&quot; B.C. 538, who
      issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own
      land (Ezra 1). It then ceased to be the capital of an
      empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies,
      till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and
      the city became a complete desolation, its very site being
      forgotten from among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of
      Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of
      vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud
      city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound
      called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted
      Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high.
      (2) The Kasr (i.e., &quot;the palace&quot;). This was the
      great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each
      side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of
      Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of
      bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on
      the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran
      ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the
      remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous
      hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter
      desolation of the city once called &quot;The glory of
      kingdoms&quot; (Isa.13:19) was foretold by the prophets
      (Isa.13:4-22; Jer. 25:12; 50:2, 3; Dan. 2:31-38).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Babylon mentioned in 1 Pet. 5:13 was not Rome, as some
      have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was
      inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; and 18:2, &quot;Babylon&quot; is
      supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the
      prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome,
      pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. &quot;The
      literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny
      and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by
      the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the
      Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that
      Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her
      method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had
      conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress
      and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all
      that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of
      Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the
      earth.&quot; Rome, or &quot;mystical Babylon,&quot; is
      &quot;that great city which reigneth over the kings of the
      earth&quot; (17:18).

      <a name="T0000410"><b>Babylonish garment -</b> a robe of
      rich colours fabricated at Babylon, and hence of great
      value (Josh.7:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000411"><b>Babylon, kingdom of -</b> called
      &quot;the land of the Chaldeans&quot; (Jer. 24:5; Ezek,
      12:13), was an extensive province in Central Asia along the
      valley of the Tigris from the Persian Gulf northward for
      some 300 miles. It was famed for its fertility and its
      riches. Its capital was the city of Babylon, a great
      commercial centre (Ezek. 17:4; Isa. 43:14). Babylonia was
      divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and
      Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the
      south. Among its chief cities may be mentioned Ur (now
      Mugheir or Mugayyar), on the western bank of the Euphrates;
      Uruk, or Erech (Gen. 10:10) (now Warka), between Ur and
      Babylon; Larsa (now Senkereh), the Ellasar of Gen. 14:1, a
      little to the east of Erech; Nipur (now Niffer), south-east
      of Babylon; Sepharvaim (2 Kings 17:24), &quot;the two
      Sipparas&quot; (now Abu-Habba), considerably to the north
      of Babylon; and Eridu, &quot;the good city&quot; (now
      Abu-Shahrein), which lay originally on the shore of the
      Persian Gulf, but is now, owing to the silting up of the
      sand, about 100 miles distant from it. Another city was
      Kulunu, or Calneh (Gen. 10:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The salt-marshes at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris
      were called Marratu, &quot;the bitter&quot; or
      &quot;salt&quot;, the Merathaim of Jer. 50:21. They were
      the original home of the Kalda, or Chaldeans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most famous of the early kings of Babylonia were Sargon
      of Accad (B.C.3800) and his son, Naram-Sin, who conquered a
      large part of Western Asia, establishing their power in
      Palestine, and even carrying their arms to the Sinaitic
      peninsula. A great Babylonian library was founded in the
      reign of Sargon. Babylonia was subsequently again broken up
      into more than one state, and at one time fell under the
      domination of Elam. This was put an end to by Khammu-rabi
      (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the country, and
      overcame Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this
      time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy. About B.C.
      1750 it was conquered by the Kassi, or Kosseans, from the
      mountains of Elam, and a Kassite dynasty ruled over it for
      576 years and 9 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Khammu-rabi, Syria and Palestine were
      subject to Babylonia and its Elamite suzerain; and after
      the overthrow of the Elamite supremacy, the Babylonian
      kings continued to exercise their influence and power in
      what was called &quot;the land of the Amorites.&quot; In
      the epoch of the Kassite dynasty, however, Canaan passed
      into the hands of Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In B.C. 729, Babylonia was conquered by the Assyrian king
      Tiglath-pileser III.; but on the death of Shalmaneser IV.
      it was seized by the Kalda or &quot;Chaldean&quot; prince
      Merodach-baladan (2 Kings 20:12-19), who held it till B.C.
      709, when he was driven out by Sargon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Sennacherib, Babylonia revolted from Assyria several
      times, with the help of the Elamites, and after one of
      these revolts Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib, B.C.
      689. It was rebuilt by Esarhaddon, who made it his
      residence during part of the year, and it was to Babylon
      that Manasseh was brought a prisoner (2 Chr. 33:11). After
      the death of Esarhaddon, Saul-sumyukin, the viceroy of
      Babylonia, revolted against his brother the Assyrian king,
      and the revolt was suppressed with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Nineveh was destroyed, B.C. 606, Nabopolassar, the
      viceroy of Babylonia, who seems to have been of Chaldean
      descent, made himself independent. His son Nebuchadrezzar
      (Nabu-kudur-uzur), after defeating the Egyptians at
      Carchemish, succeeded him as king, B.C. 604, and founded
      the Babylonian empire. He strongly fortified Babylon, and
      adorned it with palaces and other buildings. His son,
      Evil-merodach, who succeeded him in B.C. 561, was murdered
      after a reign of two years. The last monarch of the
      Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (Nabu-nahid), B.C. 555-538,
      whose eldest son, Belshazzar (Bilu-sar-uzur), is mentioned
      in several inscriptions. Babylon was captured by Cyrus,
      B.C. 538, and though it revolted more than once in later
      years, it never succeeded in maintaining its independence.

      R.V., &quot;valley of weeping,&quot; marg., &quot;or balsam
      trees&quot;), probably a valley in some part of Palestine,
      or generally some one of the valleys through which pilgrims
      had to pass on their way to the sanctuary of Jehovah on
      Zion; or it may be figuratively &quot;a valley of

      rendering of a word which means to run about tattling,
      calumniating; in Prov. 25:23, secret talebearing or
      slandering; in Rom. 1:30 and 2 Cor. 12:20, evil-speaking,

      apostatize in matters of religion (Acts 21:21; 2 Thess.
      2:3; 1 Tim. 4:1). This may be either partial (Prov. 14:14)
      or complete (Heb. 6:4-6; 10:38, 39). The apostasy may be
      both doctrinal and moral.</a>

      <a name="T0000415"><b>Badger -</b> this word is found in
      Ex. 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34; Num. 4:6, etc. The
      tabernacle was covered with badgers&#39; skins; the shoes
      of women were also made of them (Ezek. 16:10). Our
      translators seem to have been misled by the similarity in
      sound of the Hebrew <i>tachash_ and the Latin _taxus</i>,
      &quot;a badger.&quot; The revisers have correctly
      substituted &quot;seal skins.&quot; The Arabs of the
      Sinaitic peninsula apply the name <i>tucash</i> to the
      seals and dugongs which are common in the Red Sea, and the
      skins of which are largely used as leather and for sandals.
      Though the badger is common in Palestine, and might occur
      in the wilderness, its small hide would have been useless
      as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the
      shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine
      animal from 12 to 30 feet long, something between a whale
      and a seal, never leaving the water, but very easily
      caught. It grazes on seaweed, and is known by naturalists
      as Halicore tabernaculi.</a>

      elsewhere only in Isa. 3:22, where it is rendered
      &quot;crisping-pins,&quot; but denotes the reticules (or as
      R.V., &quot;satchels&quot;) carried by Hebrew women.</a>

    <p>
      (2.) Another word (kees) so rendered means a bag for

    <p>
      (3.) Another word rendered &quot;bag&quot; in 1 Sam. 17:40

      9:7; 21:5 &quot;vessel,&quot; or wallet for carrying food.

      &quot;bags,&quot; in which the priests bound up the money
      contributed for the restoration of the temple (2 Kings
      12:10), is also rendered &quot;bundle&quot; (Gen. 42:35; 1
      Sam. 25:29). It denotes bags used by travellers for
      carrying money during a journey (Prov. 7:20; Hag. 1:6).

      of Jerusalem (2 Sam. 3:16; 19:16), on the road to the
      Jordan valley. Here Shimei resided, who poured forth vile
      abuse against David, and flung dust and stones at him and
      his party when they were making their way down the eastern
      slopes of Olivet toward Jordan (16:5); and here Jonathan
      and Ahimaaz hid themselves (17:18).</a>

    <p>
      With the exception of Shimei, Azmaveth, one of David&#39;s
      heroes, is the only other native of the place who is
      mentioned (2 Sam. 23:31; 1 Chr. 11:33).

      of Moab, which had a celebrated idol-temple (Isa. 15:2). It

      idol of Moab as opposed to the &quot;high place.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0000419"><b>Bake -</b> The duty of preparing
      bread was usually, in ancient times, committed to the
      females or the slaves of the family (Gen. 18:6; Lev. 26:26;
      1 Sam. 8:13); but at a later period we find a class of
      public bakers mentioned (Hos. 7:4, 6; Jer. 37:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The bread was generally in the form of long or round cakes
      (Ex. 29:23; 1 Sam. 2:36), of a thinness that rendered them
      easily broken (Isa. 58:7; Matt. 14:19; 26:26; Acts 20:11).
      Common ovens were generally used; at other times a jar was
      half-filled with hot pebbles, and the dough was spread over
      them. Hence we read of &quot;cakes baken on the coals&quot;
      (1 Kings 19:6), and &quot;baken in the oven&quot; (Lev.
      2:4). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000421"><b>Balaam -</b> lord of the people;
      foreigner or glutton, as interpreted by others, the son of
      Beor, was a man of some rank among the Midianites (Num.
      31:8; comp. 16). He resided at Pethor (Deut. 23:4), in
      Mesopotamia (Num. 23:7). It is evident that though dwelling
      among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and
      was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he
      whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was
      cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of
      Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for
      Balaam &quot;from Aram, out of the mountains of the
      east,&quot; to curse them; but by the remarkable
      interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil
      Balak&#39;s wish, however desirous he was to do so. The
      apostle Peter refers (2 Pet. 2:15, 16) to this as an
      historical event. In Micah 6:5 reference also is made to
      the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could
      not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the
      divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them
      (Num. 25). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites
      (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak
      (Num. 31:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;doctrine of Balaam&quot; is spoken of in Rev.
      2:14, in allusion to the fact that it was through the
      teaching of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the
      Israelites might be led into sin. (See <a href=

      prophecies regarding the future of Israel of wonderful
      magnificence and beauty of expression (Num. 24:5-9, 17).

      and Isa. 46:6, as the rendering of the Hebrew <i>
      kanch&#39;</i>, which properly means &quot;a reed&quot; or
      &quot;a cane,&quot; then a rod or beam of a balance. This
      same word is translated &quot;measuring reed&quot; in Ezek.
      40:3,5; 42:16-18. There is another Hebrew word, <i>
      mozena&#39;yim</i>, i.e., &quot;two poisers&quot;, also so
      rendered (Dan. 5:27). The balances as represented on the
      most ancient Egyptian monuments resemble those now in use.
      A &quot;pair of balances&quot; is a symbol of justice and
      fair dealing (Job 31:6; Ps. 62:9; Prov. 11:1). The
      expression denotes great want and scarcity in Rev. 6:5.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000426"><b>Baldness -</b> from natural causes
      was uncommon (2 Kings 2:23; Isa. 3:24). It was included
      apparently under &quot;scab&quot; and &quot;scurf,&quot;
      which disqualified for the priesthood (Lev. 21:20). The
      Egyptians were rarely subject to it. This probably arose
      from their custom of constantly shaving the head, only
      allowing the hair to grow as a sign of mourning. With the
      Jews artificial baldness was a sign of mourning (Isa.
      22:12; Jer. 7:29; 16:6); it also marked the conclusion of a
      Nazarite&#39;s vow (Acts 18:18; 21:24; Num. 6:9). It is
      often alluded to (Micah 1:16; Amos 8:10; Jer. 47:5). The
      Jews were forbidden to follow the customs of surrounding
      nations in making themselves bald (Deut. 14:1).</a>

      Bal&#39;sam, a general name for many oily or resinous
      substances which flow or trickle from certain trees or
      plants when an incision is made through the bark.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) This word occurs in the Authorized Version (Gen.
      37:25; 43:11; Jer. 8:22; 46:11; 51:8; Ezek. 27:17) as the
      rendering of the Hebrew word <i>tsori_ or _tseri</i>, which
      denotes the gum of a tree growing in Gilead (q.v.), which
      is very precious. It was celebrated for its medicinal
      qualities, and was circulated as an article of merchandise
      by Arab and Phoenician merchants. The shrub so named was
      highly valued, and was almost peculiar to Palestine. In the
      time of Josephus it was cultivated in the neighbourhood of
      Jericho and the Dead Sea. There is an Arab tradition that
      the tree yielding this balm was brought by the queen of
      Sheba as a present to Solomon, and that he planted it in
      his gardens at Jericho.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) There is another Hebrew word, <i>basam_ or _bosem</i>,
      from which our word &quot;balsam,&quot; as well as the
      corresponding Greek balsamon, is derived. It is rendered
      &quot;spice&quot; (Cant. 5:1, 13; 6:2; margin of Revised
      Version, &quot;balsam;&quot; Ex. 35:28; 1 Kings 10:10), and
      denotes fragrance in general. <i>Basam</i> also denotes the
      true balsam-plant, a native of South Arabia (Cant. l.c.).

      simply to denote a high place where the Jews worshipped
      idols (Ezek. 20:29). The plural is translated &quot;high
      places&quot; in Num. 22:41 and Ezek. 36:2.</a>

      <a name="T0000432"><b>Bani -</b> built. (1.) 1 Chr. 6:46.
      (2.) One of David&#39;s thirty-seven warriors, a Gadite (2
      Sam. 23:36). (3.) Ezra 2:10; 10:29,34,38. (4.) A Levite who
      was prominent in the reforms on the return from Babylon
      (Neh. 8:7; 9:4,5). His son Rehum took part in rebuilding
      the wall of Jerusalem (Neh. 3:17).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000433"><b>Banner -</b> (1.) The flag or banner
      of the larger kind, serving for three tribes marching
      together. These standards, of which there were four, were
      worked with embroidery and beautifully ornamented (Num.
      1:52; 2:2, 3, 10, 18, 25; Cant. 2:4; 6:4, 10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The flag borne by each separate tribe, of a smaller
      form. Probably it bore on it the name of the tribe to which
      it belonged, or some distinguishing device (Num. 2:2,34).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A lofty signal-flag, not carried about, but
      stationary. It was usually erected on a mountain or other
      lofty place. As soon as it was seen the war-trumpets were
      blown (Ps. 60:4; Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 13:2; 18:3; 30:17; Jer.
      4:6 21; Ezek. 27:7).
    </p>

      used as a signal.

    <p>
      The banners and ensigns of the Roman army had idolatrous
      images upon them, and hence they are called the
      &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; (q.v.). The principal
      Roman standard, however, was an eagle. (See Matt. 24:28;
      Luke 17:37, where the Jewish nation is compared to a dead
      body, which the eagles gather together to devour.)
    </p>
    <p>
      God&#39;s setting up or giving a banner (Ps. 20:5; 60:4;

    <p>
      <a name="T0000434"><b>Banquet -</b> a feast provided for
      the entertainment of a company of guests (Esther 5; 7; 1
      Pet. 4:3); such as was provided for our Lord by his friends
      in Bethany (Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; comp. John 12:2). These
      meals were in the days of Christ usually called
      &quot;suppers,&quot; after the custom of the Romans, and
      were partaken of toward the close of the day. It was usual
      to send a second invitation (Matt. 22:3; Luke 14:17) to
      those who had been already invited. When the whole company
      was assembled, the master of the house shut the door with
      his own hands (Luke 13:25; Matt. 25:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were first refreshed with water and fragrant oil
      (Luke 7:38; Mark 7:4). A less frequent custom was that of
      supplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the
      feast (Eccles. 9:8; Rev. 3:4, 5; Matt. 22:11). At private
      banquets the master of the house presided; but on public
      occasions a &quot;governor of the feast&quot; was chosen
      (John 2:8). The guests were placed in order according to
      seniority (Gen. 43:33), or according to the rank they held
      (Prov. 25:6,7; Matt. 23:6; Luke 14:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      As spoons and knives and forks are a modern invention, and
      were altogether unknown in the East, the hands alone were
      necessarily used, and were dipped in the dish, which was
      common to two of the guests (John 13:26). In the days of
      our Lord the guests reclined at table; but the ancient
      Israelites sat around low tables, cross-legged, like the
      modern Orientals. Guests were specially honoured when extra
      portions were set before them (Gen. 43:34), and when their
      cup was filled with wine till it ran over (Ps. 23:5). The
      hands of the guests were usually cleaned by being rubbed on
      bread, the crumbs of which fell to the ground, and were the
      portion for dogs (Matt. 15:27; Luke 16:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the three annual festivals at Jerusalem
      family banquets were common. To these the &quot;widow, and
      the fatherless, and the stranger&quot; were welcome (Deut.
      16:11). Sacrifices also included a banquet (Ex. 34:15;
      Judg. 16:23). Birthday banquets are mentioned (Gen. 40:20;
      Matt. 14:6). They were sometimes protracted, and attended
      with revelry and excess (Gen. 21:8; 29:22; 1 Sam. 25:2,36;
      2 Sam. 13:23). Portions were sometimes sent from the table
      to poorer friends (Neh. 8:10; Esther 9:19, 22). (See <a

      <a name="T0000435"><b>Baptism, Christian -</b> an ordinance
      immediately instituted by Christ (Matt. 28:19, 20), and
      designed to be observed in the church, like that of the
      Supper, &quot;till he come.&quot; The words
      &quot;baptize&quot; and &quot;baptism&quot; are simply
      Greek words transferred into English. This was necessarily
      done by the translators of the Scriptures, for no literal
      translation could properly express all that is implied in
      them.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the
      Greek word rendered &quot;baptize.&quot; Baptists say that
      it means &quot;to dip,&quot; and nothing else. That is an
      incorrect view of the meaning of the word. It means both
      (1) to dip a thing into an element or liquid, and (2) to
      put an element or liquid over or on it. Nothing therefore
      as to the mode of baptism can be concluded from the mere
      word used. The word has a wide latitude of meaning, not
      only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX. Version of
      the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutions and
      baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected by
      immersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same
      word, &quot;washings&quot; (Heb. 9:10, 13, 19, 21) or
      &quot;baptisms,&quot; designates them all. In the New
      Testament there cannot be found a single well-authenticated
      instance of the occurrence of the word where it necessarily
      means immersion. Moreover, none of the instances of baptism
      recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (2:38-41; 8:26-39;
      9:17, 18; 22:12-16; 10:44-48; 16:32-34) favours the idea
      that it was by dipping the person baptized, or by
      immersion, while in some of them such a mode was highly
      improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole
      world, and it cannot be supposed that a form for the
      administration of baptism would have been prescribed which
      would in any place (as in a tropical country or in polar
      regions) or under any circumstances be inapplicable or
      injurious or impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptism and the Lord&#39;s Supper are the two symbolical
      ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the
      work of Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in
      the Supper a small amount of bread and wine used in this
      ordinance exhibits in symbol the great work of Christ, so
      in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully seen in the
      water poured or sprinkled on the person in the name of the
      Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That which is essential in
      baptism is only &quot;washing with water,&quot; no mode
      being specified and none being necessary or essential to
      the symbolism of the ordinance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost
      (Matt. 3:11) by his coming upon them (Acts 1:8). The fire
      also with which they were baptized sat upon them. The
      extraordinary event of Pentecost was explained by Peter as
      a fulfilment of the ancient promise that the Spirit would
      be poured out in the last days (2:17). He uses also with
      the same reference the expression shed forth as descriptive
      of the baptism of the Spirit (33). In the Pentecostal
      baptism &quot;the apostles were not dipped into the Spirit,
      nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shed forth,
      poured out, fell on them (11:15), came upon them, sat on
      them.&quot; That was a real and true baptism. We are
      warranted from such language to conclude that in like
      manner when water is poured out, falls, comes upon or rests
      upon a person when this ordinance is administered, that
      person is baptized. Baptism is therefore, in view of all
      these arguments &quot;rightly administered by pouring or
      sprinkling water upon the person.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater
      importance than those relating to its mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The controversy here is not about &quot;believers&#39;
      baptism,&quot; for that is common to all parties. Believers
      were baptized in apostolic times, and they have been
      baptized in all time by all the branches of the church. It
      is altogether a misrepresentation to allege, as is
      sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is
      &quot;believers&#39; baptism.&quot; Every instance of adult
      baptism, or of &quot;believers&#39; baptism,&quot; recorded
      in the New Testament (Acts 2:41; 8:37; 9:17, 18; 10:47;
      16:15; 19:5, etc.) is just such as would be dealt with in
      precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant
      Church, a profession of faith or of their being
      &quot;believers&quot; would be required from every one of
      them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the
      baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of
      believers, i.e., of members of the church, ought to be
      baptized.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of
      the baptism of the infants, or rather the
      &quot;children,&quot; of believing parents, the following
      considerations may be adduced:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized
      community. It is the &quot;kingdom of God,&quot; one
      historic kingdom under all dispensations. The commonwealth
      of Israel was the &quot;church&quot; (Acts 7:38; Rom. 9:4)
      under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testament church is
      not a new and different church, but one with that of the
      Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church have
      always been the same viz., a profession of faith and a
      promise of subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is
      a fact beyond dispute that the children of God&#39;s people
      under the old dispensation were recognized as members of
      the church. Circumcision was the sign and seal of their
      membership. It was not because of carnal descent from
      Abraham, but as being the children of God&#39;s professing
      people, that this rite was administered (Rom. 4:11). If
      children were members of the church under the old
      dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, then they are
      members of the church now by the same right, unless it can
      be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under the
      Old Testament parents acted for their children and
      represented them. (See Gen. 9:9; 17:10; Ex. 24:7, 8; Deut.
      29:9-13.) When parents entered into covenant with God, they
      brought their children with them. This was a law in the
      Hebrew Church. When a proselyte was received into
      membership, he could not enter without bringing his
      children with him. The New Testament does not exclude the
      children of believers from the church. It does not deprive
      them of any privilege they enjoyed under the Old Testament.
      There is no command or statement of any kind, that can be
      interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea,
      anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church
      membership of infants has never been set aside. The ancient
      practice, orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a
      law of his kingdom till repealed by the same divine
      authority. There are lambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd
      (John 21:15; comp. Luke 1:15; Matt. 19:14; 1 Cor. 7:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;In a company of converts applying for admission into
      Christ&#39;s house there are likely to be some heads of
      families. How is their case to be treated? How, for
      example, are Lydia and her neighbour the keeper of the city
      prison to be treated? Both have been converted. Both are
      heads of families. They desire to be received into the
      infant church of Philippi. What is Christ&#39;s direction
      to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect:
      &#39;Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my
      house. But you must come in by yourselves. These babes in
      your arms, you must leave them outside. They cannot believe
      yet, and so they cannot come in. Those other little ones by
      your side, their hearts may perhaps have been touched with
      the love of God; still, they are not old enough to make a
      personal profession, so they too must be left outside...For
      the present you must leave them where they are and come in
      by yourselves.&#39; One may reasonably demand very
      stringent proofs before accepting this as a fair
      representation of the sort of welcome Christ offers to
      parents who come to his door bringing their children with
      them. Surely it is more consonant with all we know about
      him to suppose that his welcome will be more ample in its
      scope, and will breathe a more gracious tone. Surely it
      would be more like the Good Shepherd to say, &#39;Come in,
      and bring your little ones along with you. The youngest
      needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible to my
      salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them about
      either sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its
      way into their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon
      and a new life. From Adam they have inherited sin and
      death; and I can so unite them to myself that in me they
      shall be heirs of righteousness and life. You may without
      misgiving bring them to me. And the law of my house
      requires that the same day which witnesses your reception
      into it by baptism must witness their reception
      also&#39;&quot; (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.).

      <a name="T0000436"><b>Baptism for the dead -</b> only
      mentioned in 1 Cor. 15:29. This expression as used by the
      apostle may be equivalent to saying, &quot;He who goes
      through a baptism of blood in order to join a glorified
      church which has no existence [i.e., if the dead rise not]
      is a fool.&quot; Some also regard the statement here as an
      allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said,
      to prevail at Corinth, in which a person was baptized in
      the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to
      whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would
      be extended. This they think may have been one of the
      erroneous customs which Paul went to Corinth to &quot;set
      in order.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000437"><b>Baptism, John&#39;s -</b> was not
      Christian baptism, nor was that which was practised by the
      disciples previous to our Lord&#39;s crucifixion. Till then
      the New Testament economy did not exist. John&#39;s baptism
      bound its subjects to repentance, and not to the faith of
      Christ. It was not administered in the name of the Trinity,
      and those whom John baptized were rebaptized by Paul (Acts
      18:24; 19:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000438"><b>Baptism of Christ -</b> Christ had to
      be formally inaugurated into the public discharge of his
      offices. For this purpose he came to John, who was the
      representative of the law and the prophets, that by him he
      might be introduced into his offices, and thus be publicly
      recognized as the Messiah of whose coming the prophecies
      and types had for many ages borne witness.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      John refused at first to confer his baptism on Christ, for
      he understood not what he had to do with the &quot;baptism
      of repentance.&quot; But Christ said, &quot;&#39;Suffer it
      to be so now,&#39; NOW as suited to my state of
      humiliation, my state as a substitute in the room of
      sinners.&quot; His reception of baptism was not necessary
      on his own account. It was a voluntary act, the same as his
      act of becoming incarnate. Yet if the work he had engaged
      to accomplish was to be completed, then it became him to
      take on him the likeness of a sinner, and to fulfil all
      righteousness (Matt. 3:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The official duty of Christ and the sinless person of
      Christ are to be distinguished. It was in his official
      capacity that he submitted to baptism. In coming to John
      our Lord virtually said, &quot;Though sinless, and without
      any personal taint, yet in my public or official capacity
      as the Sent of God, I stand in the room of many, and bring
      with me the sin of the world, for which I am the
      propitiation.&quot; Christ was not made under the law on
      his own account. It was as surety of his people, a position
      which he spontaneously assumed. The administration of the
      rite of baptism was also a symbol of the baptism of
      suffering before him in this official capacity (Luke
      12:50). In thus presenting himself he in effect dedicated
      or consecrated himself to the work of fulfilling all
      righteousness.

      Barley bread was used by the poorer people (Judg. 7:13; 2
      Kings 4:42). Barley of the first crop was ready for the
      harvest by the time of the Passover, in the middle of April
      (Ruth 1:22; 2 Sam. 21:9). Mention is made of barley-meal

      <a name="T0000453"><b>Barnabas -</b> son of consolation,
      the surname of Joses, a Levite (Acts 4:36). His name stands
      first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at
      Antioch (13:1). Luke speaks of him as a &quot;good
      man&quot; (11:24). He was born of Jewish parents of the
      tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a
      possession of land (Acts 4:36, 37), which he sold. His
      personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and
      commanding (Acts 14:11, 12). When Paul returned to
      Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and
      introduced him to the apostles (9:27). They had probably
      been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles
      and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to
      superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive
      and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to
      assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured
      with him for a whole year (Acts 11:25, 26). The two were at
      the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the
      contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer
      brethren there (11:28-30). Shortly after they returned,
      bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as
      missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity
      visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia
      Minor (Acts 13:14). Returning from this first missionary
      journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to
      consult with the church there regarding the relation of
      Gentiles to the church (Acts 15:2: Gal. 2:1). This matter
      having been settled, they returned again to Antioch,
      bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which
      Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a
      dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety
      of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by
      Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas
      as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia;
      while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited
      Cyprus (Acts 15:36-41). Barnabas is not again mentioned by
      Luke in the Acts.

      prophecies regarding the invasion of the Babylonians and
      the Captivity. These he read to the people from a window in
      the temple in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim,
      king of Judah (Jer. 36). He afterwards read them before the
      counsellors of the king at a private interview; and then to

      enemies of favouring the Chaldeans, he was cast, with
      Jeremiah, into prison, where he remained till the capture
      of Jerusalem (B.C. 586). He probably died in Babylon.

      and his confederates &quot;smote the Rephaim in
      Ashteroth,&quot; where Og the king of Bashan had his
      residence. At the time of Israel&#39;s entrance into the
      Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly
      routed (Num. 21:33-35; Deut. 3:1-7). This country extended
      from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from
      the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with
      the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of
      Manasseh (Josh. 13:29-31). Golan, one of its cities, became
      a &quot;city of refuge&quot; (Josh. 21:27). Argob, in
      Bashan, was one of Solomon&#39;s commissariat districts (1
      Kings 4:13). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael (2
      Kings 10:33), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash (2
      Kings 13:25), who overcame the Syrians in three battles,
      according to the word of Elisha (19). From this time Bashan
      almost disappears from history, although we read of the
      wild cattle of its rich pastures (Ezek. 39:18; Ps. 22:12),
      the oaks of its forests (Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6; Zech.
      11:2), and the beauty of its extensive plains (Amos 4:1;
      Jer. 50:19). Soon after the conquest, the name
      &quot;Gilead&quot; was given to the whole country beyond
      Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four

      Edomites sprung. She is also called Mahalath (Gen. 28:9).
      It is noticeable that Esau&#39;s three wives receive
      different names in the genealogical table of the Edomites
      (Gen. 36) from those given to them in the history (Gen.

      A metallic vessel; sometimes rendered &quot;bowl&quot;

      <a name="T0000467"><b>Basket -</b> There are five different
      Hebrew words so rendered in the Authorized Version: (1.) A
      basket (Heb. sal, a twig or osier) for holding bread (Gen.
      40:16; Ex. 29:3, 23; Lev. 8:2, 26, 31; Num. 6:15, 17, 19).
      Sometimes baskets were made of twigs peeled; their
      manufacture was a recognized trade among the Hebrews.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) That used (Heb. salsilloth&#39;) in gathering grapes
      (Jer. 6:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) That in which the first fruits of the harvest were
      presented, Heb. tene, (Deut. 26:2, 4). It was also used for
      household purposes. In form it tapered downwards like that
      called <i>corbis</i> by the Romans.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A basket (Heb. kelub) having a lid, resembling a
      bird-cage. It was made of leaves or rushes. The name is
      also applied to fruit-baskets (Amos 8:1, 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) A basket (Heb. dud) for carrying figs (Jer. 24:2),
      also clay to the brick-yard (R.V., Ps. 81:6), and bulky
      articles (2 Kings 10:7). This word is also rendered in the
      Authorized Version &quot;kettle&quot; (1 Sam. 2:14),
      &quot;caldron&quot; (2 Chr. 35:13),
      &quot;seething-pot&quot; (Job 41:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament mention is made of the basket (Gr.
      kophinos, small &quot;wicker-basket&quot;) for the
      &quot;fragments&quot; in the miracle recorded Mark 6:43,
      and in that recorded Matt. 15:37 (Gr. spuris, large
      &quot;rope-basket&quot;); also of the basket in which Paul
      escaped (Acts 9:25, Gr. spuris; 2 Cor. 11: 33, Gr. sargane,
      &quot;basket of plaited cords&quot;).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000468"><b>Bastard -</b> In the Old Testament
      the rendering of the Hebrew word <i>mamzer&#39;</i>, which
      means &quot;polluted.&quot; In Deut. 23:2, it occurs in the
      ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In Zech. 9:6, the
      word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of
      Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among
      the Jews (Judg. 11:1-7). In Heb. 12:8, the word (Gr.
      nothoi) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those
      who do not share the privileges of God&#39;s children.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000469"><b>Bastinado -</b> beating, a mode of
      punishment common in the East. It is referred to by
      &quot;the rod of correction&quot; (Prov. 22:15),
      &quot;scourging&quot; (Lev. 19:20), &quot;chastising&quot;
      (Deut. 22:18). The number of blows could not exceed forty
      (Deut. 25:2, 3).</a>

      <a name="T0000470"><b>Bat -</b> The Hebrew word
      (atalleph&#39;) so rendered (Lev. 11:19; Deut. 14:18)
      implies &quot;flying in the dark.&quot; The bat is reckoned
      among the birds in the list of unclean animals. To cast
      idols to the &quot;moles and to the bats&quot; means to
      carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which
      these animals resort (Isa. 2:20), i.e., to consign them to
      desolation or ruin.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000471"><b>Bath -</b> a Hebrew liquid measure,
      the tenth part of an homer (1 Kings 7:26, 38; Ezek. 45:10,
      14). It contained 8 gallons 3 quarts of our measure.
      &quot;Ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0000473"><b>Baths -</b> The use of the bath was
      very frequent among the Hebrews (Lev. 14:8; Num. 19:19,
      ect.). The high priest at his inauguration (Lev. 8:6), and
      on the day of atonement, was required to bathe himself
      (16:4, 24). The &quot;pools&quot; mentioned in Neh. 3:15,
      16, 2 Kings 20:20, Isa. 22:11, John 9:7, were public
      bathing-places.</a>

      oath, or of seven, called also Bath-shu&#39;a (1 Chr. 3:5),
      was the daughter of Eliam (2 Sam. 11:3) or Ammiel (1 Chr.
      3:5), and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David committed
      adultery with her (2 Sam. 11:4, 5; Ps. 51:1). The child
      born in adultery died (2 Sam. 12:15-19). After her husband
      was slain (11:15) she was married to David (11:27), and
      became the mother of Solomon (12:24; 1 Kings 1:11; 2:13).
      She took a prominent part in securing the succession of
      Solomon to the throne (1 Kings 1:11, 16-21).</a>

      <a name="T0000475"><b>Battering-ram -</b> (Ezek. 4:2;
      21:22), a military engine, consisting of a long beam of
      wood hung upon a frame, for making breaches in walls. The
      end of it which was brought against the wall was shaped
      like a ram&#39;s head.</a>

      fighting (Zech. 9:10; 10:4). &quot;Thy bow was made quite
      naked&quot; (Hab. 3:9) means that it was made ready for
      use. By David&#39;s order (2 Sam. 1:18) the young men were
      taught the use, or rather the song of the bow. (See ARMOUR

      balustrade surrounding the flat roofs of the houses,
      required to be built by a special law (Deut. 22:8). In Jer.
      5:10, it denotes the parapet of a city wall.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000479"><b>Bay -</b> denotes the estuary of the
      Dead Sea at the mouth of the Jordan (Josh. 15:5; 18:19),
      also the southern extremity of the same sea (15:2). The
      same Hebrew word is rendered &quot;tongue&quot; in Isa.
      11:15, where it is used with reference to the forked mouths
      of the Nile.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bay in Zech. 6:3, 7 denotes the colour of horses, but the
      original Hebrew means strong, and is here used rather to
      describe the horses as fleet or spirited.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000480"><b>Bay tree -</b> named only in Ps.
      37:35, Authorized Version. The Hebrew word so rendered is
      <i>ereh</i>, which simply means &quot;native born&quot;,
      i.e., a tree not transplanted, but growing on its native
      soil, and therefore luxuriantly. If the psalmist intended
      by this word to denote any particular tree, it may have
      been the evergreen bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), which is a
      native of Palestine. Instead of &quot;like a green bay
      tree&quot; in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version
      has, &quot;like a green tree in its native soil.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000481"><b>Bdellium -</b> occurs only in Gen.
      2:12, where it designates a product of the land of Havilah;
      and in Num. 11:7, where the manna is likened to it in
      colour. It was probably an aromatic gum like balsam which
      exuded from a particular tree (Borassus flabelliformis)
      still found in Arabia, Media, and India. It bears a
      resemblance in colour to myrrh. Others think the word
      denotes &quot;pearls,&quot; or some precious stone.</a>

      <a name="T0000482"><b>Beacon -</b> a pole (Heb. to&#39;ren)
      used as a standard or ensign set on the tops of mountains
      as a call to the people to assemble themselves for some
      great national purpose (Isa. 30:17). In Isa. 33:23 and
      Ezek. 27:5, the same word is rendered &quot;mast.&quot;

      a Benjamite, one of David&#39;s thirty heroes of the sling
      and bow (1 Chr. 12:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000484"><b>Bealoth -</b> citizens, a town in the
      extreme south of Judah (Josh. 15:24); probably the same as
      Baalath-beer (19:8). In 1 Kings 4:16, the Authorized
      Version has &quot;in Aloth,&quot; the Revised Version
      &quot;Bealoth.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000485"><b>Beam -</b> occurs in the Authorized
      Version as the rendering of various Hebrew words. In 1 Sam.
      17:7, it means a weaver&#39;s frame or principal beam; in
      Hab. 2:11, a crossbeam or girder; 2 Kings 6:2, 5, a
      cross-piece or rafter of a house; 1 Kings 7:6, an
      architectural ornament as a projecting step or moulding;
      Ezek. 41:25, a thick plank. In the New Testament the word
      occurs only in Matt. 7:3, 4, 5, and Luke 6:41, 42, where it
      means (Gr. dokos) a large piece of wood used for building
      purposes, as contrasted with &quot;mote&quot; (Gr.
      karphos), a small piece or mere splinter. &quot;Mote&quot;
      and &quot;beam&quot; became proverbial for little and great
      faults.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000486"><b>Beans -</b> mentioned in 2 Sam. 17:28
      as having been brought to David when flying from Absalom.
      They formed a constituent in the bread Ezekiel (4:9) was
      commanded to make, as they were in general much used as an
      article of diet. They are extensively cultivated in Egypt
      and Arabia and Syria.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000487"><b>Bear -</b> a native of the mountain
      regions of Western Asia, frequently mentioned in Scripture.
      David defended his flocks against the attacks of a bear (1
      Sam. 17:34-37). Bears came out of the wood and destroyed
      the children who mocked the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 2:24).
      Their habits are referred to in Isa. 59:11; Prov. 28:15;
      Lam. 3:10. The fury of the female bear when robbed of her
      young is spoken of (2 Sam. 17:8; Prov. 17:12; Hos. 13:8).
      In Daniel&#39;s vision of the four great monarchies, the
      Medo-Persian empire is represented by a bear (7:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000488"><b>Beard -</b> The mode of wearing it
      was definitely prescribed to the Jews (Lev. 19:27; 21:5).
      Hence the import of Ezekiel&#39;s (5:1-4) description of
      the &quot;razor&quot; i.e., the agents of an angry
      providence being used against the guilty nation of the
      Jews. It was a part of a Jew&#39;s daily toilet to anoint
      his beard with oil and perfume (Ps. 133:2). Beards were
      trimmed with the most fastidious care (2 Sam. 19:24), and
      their neglet was an indication of deep sorrow (Isa. 15:2;
      Jer. 41:5). The custom was to shave or pluck off the hair
      as a sign of mourning (Isa. 50:6; Jer. 48:37; Ezra 9:3).
      The beards of David&#39;s ambassadors were cut off by hanun
      (2 Sam. 10:4) as a mark of indignity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the Egyptians carefully shaved the hair
      off their faces, and they compelled their slaves to do so
      also (Gen. 41:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000489"><b>Beast -</b> This word is used of
      flocks or herds of grazing animals (Ex. 22:5; Num. 20:4, 8,
      11; Ps. 78:48); of beasts of burden (Gen. 45:17); of
      eatable beasts (Prov. 9:2); and of swift beasts or
      dromedaries (Isa. 60:6). In the New Testament it is used of
      a domestic animal as property (Rev. 18:13); as used for
      food (1 Cor. 15:39), for service (Luke 10:34; Acts 23:24),
      and for sacrifice (Acts 7:42).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When used in contradistinction to man (Ps. 36:6), it
      denotes a brute creature generally, and when in
      contradistinction to creeping things (Lev. 11:2-7; 27:26),
      a four-footed animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mosaic law required that beasts of labour should have
      rest on the Sabbath (Ex. 20:10; 23:12), and in the
      Sabbatical year all cattle were allowed to roam about
      freely, and eat whatever grew in the fields (Ex. 23:11;
      Lev. 25:7). No animal could be castrated (Lev. 22:24).
      Animals of different kinds were to be always kept separate
      (Lev. 19:19; Deut. 22:10). Oxen when used in threshing were
      not to be prevented from eating what was within their reach
      (Deut. 25:4; 1 Cor.9:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is used figuratively of an infuriated multitude
      (1 Cor. 15:32; Acts 19:29; comp. Ps. 22:12, 16; Eccl. 3:18;
      Isa. 11:6-8), and of wicked men (2 Pet. 2:12). The four
      beasts of Daniel 7:3, 17, 23 represent four kingdoms or
      kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000490"><b>Beaten gold -</b> in Num. 8:4, means
      &quot;turned&quot; or rounded work in gold. The Greek
      Version, however, renders the word &quot;solid gold;&quot;
      the Revised Version, &quot;beaten work of gold.&quot; In 1
      Kings 10:16, 17, it probably means &quot;mixed&quot; gold,
      as the word ought to be rendered, i.e., not pure gold.
      Others render the word in these places &quot;thin plates of
      gold.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000491"><b>Beaten oil -</b> (Ex. 27:20; 29:40),

      them in a mill. It was reckoned the best. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000493"><b>Becher -</b> first-born; a youth, the
      second son of Benjamin (Gen. 46:21), who came down to Egypt
      with Jacob. It is probable that he married an Ephraimitish
      heiress, and that his descendants were consequently
      reckoned among the tribe of Ephraim (Num. 26:35; 1 Chr.
      7:20, 21). They are not reckoned among the descendants of
      Benjamin (Num. 26:38).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000494"><b>Bed -</b> (Heb. mittah), for rest at
      night (Ex. 8:3; 1 Sam. 19:13, 15, 16, etc.); during
      sickness (Gen. 47:31; 48:2; 49:33, etc.); as a sofa for
      rest (1 Sam. 28:23; Amos 3:12). Another Hebrew word
      (er&#39;es) so rendered denotes a canopied bed, or a bed
      with curtains (Deut. 3:11; Ps. 132:3), for sickness (Ps.
      6:6; 41:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament it denotes sometimes a litter with a
      coverlet (Matt. 9:2, 6; Luke 5:18; Acts 5:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jewish bedstead was frequently merely the divan or
      platform along the sides of the house, sometimes a very
      slight portable frame, sometimes only a mat or one or more
      quilts. The only material for bed-clothes is mentioned in 1
      Sam. 19:13. Sleeping in the open air was not uncommon, the
      sleeper wrapping himself in his outer garment (Ex.
      22:26,27; Deut. 24:12,13).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000495"><b>Bedan -</b> one of the judges of
      Israel (1 Sam. 12:11). It is uncertain who he was. Some
      suppose that Barak is meant, others Samson, but most
      probably this is a contracted form of Abdon (Judg.
      12:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000496"><b>Bed-chamber -</b> an apartment in
      Eastern houses, furnished with a slightly elevated platform
      at the upper end and sometimes along the sides, on which
      were laid mattresses. This was the general arrangement of
      the public sleeping-room for the males of the family and
      for guests, but there were usually besides distinct
      bed-chambers of a more private character (2 Kings 4:10; Ex.
      8:3; 2 Kings 6:12). In 2 Kings 11:2 this word denotes, as
      in the margin of the Revised Version, a store-room in which
      mattresses were kept.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000497"><b>Bedstead -</b> used in Deut. 3:11,
      but elsewhere rendered &quot;couch,&quot; &quot;bed.&quot;
      In 2 Kings 1:4; 16:2; Ps. 132:3; Amos 3:12, the divan is
      meant by this word.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000498"><b>Bee -</b> First mentioned in Deut.
      1:44. Swarms of bees, and the danger of their attacks, are
      mentioned in Ps. 118:12. Samson found a &quot;swarm of
      bees&quot; in the carcass of a lion he had slain (Judg.
      14:8). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods
      and in clefts of rocks (Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16). In Isa.
      7:18 the &quot;fly&quot; and the &quot;bee&quot; are
      personifications of the Egyptians and Assyrians, the
      inveterate enemies of Israel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000499"><b>Beelzebub -</b> (Gr. form
      Beel&#39;zebul), the name given to Satan, and found only in
      the New Testament (Matt. 10:25; 12:24, 27; Mark 3:22). It
      is probably the same as Baalzebub (q.v.), the god of Ekron,
      meaning &quot;the lord of flies,&quot; or, as others think,
      &quot;the lord of dung,&quot; or &quot;the dung-god.&quot;
