      <a name="T0000500"><b>Beer -</b> well. (1.) A place where a
      well was dug by the direction of Moses, at the forty-fourth
      station of the Hebrews in their wanderings (Num. 21:16-18)
      in the wilderness of Moab. (See <a href=

      WELL</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A town in the tribe of Judah to which Jotham fled for
      fear of Abimelech (Judg. 9:21). Some have identified this
      place with Beeroth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000501"><b>Beer-elim -</b> well of heroes,
      probably the name given to Beer, the place where the chiefs
      of Israel dug a well (Num. 21:16; Isa. 15:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000502"><b>Beeri -</b> illustrious, or the
      well-man. (1.) The father of Judith, one of the wives of
      Esau (Gen. 26:34), the same as Adah (Gen. 36:2). (2.) The
      father of the prophet Hosea (1:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000503"><b>Beer-lahai-roi -</b> i.e., &quot;the
      well of him that liveth and seeth me,&quot; or, as some
      render it, &quot;the well of the vision of life&quot;, the
      well where the Lord met with Hagar (Gen. 16:7-14). Isaac
      dwelt beside this well (24:62; 25:11). It has been
      identified with &#39;Ain Muweileh, or Moilahhi, south-west
      of Beersheba, and about 12 miles W. from Kadesh-barnea.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000504"><b>Beeroth -</b> wells, one of the four
      cities of the Hivites which entered by fraud into a league
      with Joshua. It belonged to Benjamin (Josh. 18:25). It has
      by some been identified with el-Bireh on the way to Nablus,
      10 miles north of Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000505"><b>Beeroth of the children of Jaakan
      -</b> (Deut. 10:6). The same as Bene-jaakan (Num.
      33:31).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000506"><b>Beersheba -</b> well of the oath, or
      well of seven, a well dug by Abraham, and so named because
      he and Abimelech here entered into a compact (Gen. 21:31).
      On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name (Gen.
      26:31-33). It was a favourite place of abode of both of
      these patriarchs (21:33-22:1, 19; 26:33; 28:10). It is
      mentioned among the &quot;cities&quot; given to the tribe
      of Simeon (Josh. 19:2; 1 Chr. 4:28). From Dan to Beersheba,
      a distance of about 144 miles (Judg. 20:1; 1 Chr. 21:2; 2
      Sam. 24:2), became the usual way of designating the whole
      Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return
      from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into &quot;from
      Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom&quot; (Neh. 11:30). The
      kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount
      Ephraim (2 Chr. 19:4). The name is not found in the New
      Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba,
      i.e., &quot;well of the seven&quot;, where there are to the
      present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It
      is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea
      and the Mediterranean.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000507"><b>Beetle -</b> (Heb. hargol, meaning
      &quot;leaper&quot;). Mention of it is made only in Lev.
      11:22, where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly
      the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least
      four feet, &quot;which has legs above its feet, to leap
      withal.&quot; The description plainly points to the locust
      (q.v.). This has been an article of food from the earliest
      times in the East to the present day. The word is rendered
      &quot;cricket&quot; in the Revised Version.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000508"><b>Beeves -</b> (an old English plural
      of the word beef), a name applicable to all ruminating
      animals except camels, and especially to the Bovidce, or
      horned cattle (Lev. 22:19, 21; Num. 31:28, 30, 33, 38,
      44).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000509"><b>Beg -</b> That the poor existed among
      the Hebrews we have abundant evidence (Ex. 23:11; Deut.
      15:11), but there is no mention of beggars properly so
      called in the Old Testament. The poor were provided for by
      the law of Moses (Lev. 19:10; Deut. 12:12; 14:29). It is
      predicted of the seed of the wicked that they shall be
      beggars (Ps. 37:25; 109:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament we find not seldom mention made of
      beggars (Mark 10:46; Luke 16:20, 21; Acts 3:2), yet there
      is no mention of such a class as vagrant beggars, so
      numerous in the East. &quot;Beggarly,&quot; in Gal. 4:9,
      means worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000510"><b>Behead -</b> a method of taking away
      life practised among the Egyptians (Gen. 40:17-19). There
      are instances of this mode of punishment also among the
      Hebrews (2 Sam. 4:8; 20:21,22; 2 Kings 10:6-8). It is also
      mentioned in the New Testament (Matt. 14:8-12; Acts
      12:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000511"><b>Behemoth -</b> (Job 40:15-24). Some
      have supposed this to be an Egyptian word meaning a
      &quot;water-ox.&quot; The Revised Version has here in the
      margin &quot;hippopotamus,&quot; which is probably the
      correct rendering of the word. The word occurs frequently
      in Scripture, but, except here, always as a common name,
      and translated &quot;beast&quot; or &quot;cattle.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000512"><b>Bekah -</b> Both the name and its
      explanation, &quot;a half shekel,&quot; are given in Ex.
      38:26. The word properly means a &quot;division,&quot; a
      &quot;part.&quot; (R.V., &quot;beka.&quot;)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000513"><b>Bel -</b> the Aramaic form of Baal,
      the national god of the Babylonians (Isa. 46:1; Jer. 50:2;
      51:44). It signifies &quot;lord.&quot; (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000300.html&amp;from=T0000382&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      BAAL</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000514"><b>Bela -</b> a thing swallowed. (1.) A
      city on the shore of the Dead Sea, not far from Sodom,
      called also Zoar. It was the only one of the five cities
      that was spared at Lot&#39;s intercession (Gen. 19:20,23).
      It is first mentioned in Gen. 14:2,8.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The eldest son of Benjamin (Num. 26:38;
      &quot;Belah,&quot; Gen. 46:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The son of Beor, and a king of Edom (Gen. 36:32, 33; 1
      Chr. 1:43).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A son of Azaz (1 Chr. 5:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000515"><b>Belial -</b> worthlessness,
      frequently used in the Old Testament as a proper name. It
      is first used in Deut. 13:13. In the New Testament it is
      found only in 2 Cor. 6:15, where it is used as a name of
      Satan, the personification of all that is evil. It is
      translated &quot;wicked&quot; in Deut. 15:9; Ps. 41:8 (R.V.
      marg.); 101:3; Prov. 6:12, etc. The expression
      &quot;son&quot; or &quot;man of Belial&quot; means simply a
      worthless, lawless person (Judg. 19:22; 20:13; 1 Sam. 1:16;
      2:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000516"><b>Bell -</b> The bells first mentioned
      in Scripture are the small golden bells attached to the hem
      of the high priest&#39;s ephod (Ex. 28:33, 34, 35). The
      &quot;bells of the horses&quot; mentioned by Zechariah
      (14:20) were attached to the bridles or belts round the
      necks of horses trained for war, so as to accustom them to
      noise and tumult.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000517"><b>Bellows -</b> occurs only in Jer.
      6:29, in relation to the casting of metal. Probably they
      consisted of leather bags similar to those common in
      Egypt.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000518"><b>Belly -</b> the seat of the carnal
      affections (Titus 1:12; Phil. 3:19; Rom. 16:18). The word
      is used symbolically for the heart (Prov. 18:8; 20:27;
      22:18, marg.). The &quot;belly of hell&quot; signifies the
      grave or underworld (Jonah 2:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000519"><b>Belshazzar -</b> Bel protect the
      king!, the last of the kings of Babylon (Dan. 5:1). He was
      the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of
      Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still
      young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and
      when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his
      &quot;father&quot; (Dan. 5:2), or grandfather,
      Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in
      Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the
      midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king
      tracing on the wall the announcement of God&#39;s judgment,
      which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the
      queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he
      interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the
      Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain (Dan.
      5:30). (See NERGAL-SHAREZER &macr;T0002709.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments was
      long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the
      Book of Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an
      inscription of Nabonidus which referred to his eldest son.
      Quite recently, however, the side of a ravine undermined by
      heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A number
      of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These
      were filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a
      firm of Babylonian bankers, which showed that Belshazzar
      had a household, with secretaries and stewards. One was
      dated in the third year of the king Marduk-sar-uzur. As
      Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this
      Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of
      Scripture. In one of these contract tablets, dated in the
      July after the defeat of the army of Nabonidus, we find him
      paying tithes for his sister to the temple of the sun-god
      at Sippara.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000520"><b>Belteshazzar -</b> Beltis protect the
      king!, the Chaldee name given to Daniel by Nebuchadnezzar
      (Dan. 1:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000521"><b>Benaiah -</b> built up by Jehovah.
      (1.) The son of Jehoiada, chief priest (1 Chr. 27:5). He
      was set by David over his body-guard of Cherethites and
      Pelethites (2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kings 1:32; 1 Chr. 18:17). His
      exploits are enumerated in 2 Sam. 23:20, 21, 22; 1 Chr.
      11:22. He remained faithful to Solomon (1 Kings 1:8, 10,
      26), by whom he was raised to the rank of
      commander-in-chief (1 Kings 2:25, 29, 30, 34, 35; 4:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) 2 Sam. 23:30; 1 Chr. 11:31.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A musical Levite (1 Chr. 15:18, 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A priest (1 Chr. 15:24; 16:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The son of Jeiel (2 Chr. 20:14).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000522"><b>Ben-ammi -</b> son of my kindred;
      i.e., &quot;born of incest&quot;, the son of Lot by his
      youngest daughter (Gen. 19:38).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000523"><b>Bench -</b> deck of a Tyrian ship,
      described by Ezekiel (27:6) as overlaid with box-wood.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000524"><b>Bene-jaakan -</b> children of Jaakan
      (Num. 33:31, 32), the same as Beeroth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000525"><b>Ben-hadad -</b> the standing title of
      the Syrian kings, meaning &quot;the son of Hadad.&quot;
      (See <a href=

      HADADEZER</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The king of Syria whom Asa, king of Judah, employed to
      invade Israel (1 Kings 15:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Son of the preceding, also king of Syria. He was long
      engaged in war against Israel. He was murdered probably by
      Hazael, by whom he was succeeded (2 Kings 8:7-15), after a
      reign of some thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) King of Damascus, and successor of his father Hazael
      on the throne of Syria (2 Kings 13:3, 4). His misfortunes
      in war are noticed by Amos (1:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000526"><b>Benjamin -</b> son of my right hand.
      (1.) The younger son of Jacob by Rachel (Gen. 35:18). His
      birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and
      Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His
      mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath
      named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed
      by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called
      Benjamites (Gen. 49:27; Deut. 33:12; Josh. 18:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but
      one (Num. 1:36, 37; Ps. 68:27). During the march its place
      was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the
      tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600
      warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of
      Jacob (Gen. 49:27) that the figure of a wolf was on the
      tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in Rom. 11:1;
      Phil. 3:5.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south
      of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12
      in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan
      intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns
      are named in Josh. 18:21-28.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a
      desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the
      other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated
      (Judg. 20:20, 21; 21:10). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001400.html&amp;from=T0001476&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      GIBEAH</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close
      alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in
      the time of David (2 Sam. 19:16, 17), which continued after
      his death (1 Kings 11:13; 12:20). After the Exile these two
      tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation (Ezra
      1:5; 10:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers (1 Sam.
      20:20, 36; 2 Sam. 1:22; 1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2) and slingers
      (Judge. 20:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem (Jer.
      37:13; 38:7; Zech. 14:10), was so called because it led in
      the direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It
      is called by Jeremiah (20:2) &quot;the high gate of
      Benjamin;&quot; also &quot;the gate of the children of the
      people&quot; (17:19). (Comp. 2 Kings 14:13.)

      the high priest (Ex. 28:20; R.V. marg.,
      &quot;chalcedony;&quot; 39:13). The colour of the wheels in
      Ezekiel&#39;s vision was as the colour of a beryl stone
      (1:16; 10:9; R.V., &quot;stone of Tarshish&quot;). It is
      mentioned in Cant. 5:14; Dan. 10:6; Rev. 21:20. In Ezek.
      28:13 the LXX. render the word by &quot;chrysolite,&quot;

      The Revised Version in John 1:28 has this word instead of

      (2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of
      Olives (Mark 11:1), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the
      road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of
      palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of
      Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in
      connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord
      (Matt. 21:17; 26:6; Mark 11:11, 12; 14:3; Luke 24:50; John
      11:1; 12:1). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh,
      i.e., &quot;place of Lazarus,&quot; or simply Lazariyeh.
      Seen from a distance, the village has been described as
      &quot;remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement
      and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace.&quot; Now a mean
      village, containing about twenty families.

      Josh. 15:61 it is said to have been &quot;in the

      of Benjamin. It is called Arabah (Josh. 18:18).</a>

      Probably the same as Beth-haran in Num. 32:36. It was
      called by king Herod, Julias, or Livias, after Livia, the

      In Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5 it stands for &quot;Bethel&quot;
      (q.v.), and it is so called because it was no longer the
      &quot;house of God,&quot; but &quot;the house of

      when he returned from Mesopotamia, near the Jabbok (Gen.
      32:22), and at which Jephthah slew the Ephraimites (Judg.
      12:4). Nothing, however, is certainly known of it. (See <a

      &quot;Diblah.&quot;)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000554"><b>Bethel -</b> house of God. (1.) A
      place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of
      Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It
      was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz (Gen.
      28:19). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to
      the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not
      given to the city itself till after its conquest by the
      tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his
      second encampment between Bethel and Hai (Gen. 12:8); and
      on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again
      &quot;called upon the name of the Lord&quot; (13:4). Here
      Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of
      the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder
      whose top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his
      return he again visited this place, &quot;where God talked
      with him&quot; (35:1-15), and there he &quot;built an
      altar, and called the place El-beth-el&quot; (q.v.). To
      this second occasion of God&#39;s speaking with Jacob at
      Bethel, Hosea (12:4,5) makes reference.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel
      of God (Judg. 20:18, 31; 21:2). Here the ark of the
      covenant was kept for a long time under the care of
      Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron (20:26-28). Here also
      Samuel held in rotation his court of justice (1 Sam. 7:16).
      It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided,
      and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden
      calf (1 Kings 12:28-33; 13:1). Hence the prophet Hosea
      (Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5, 8) calls it in contempt Beth-aven,
      i.e., &quot;house of idols.&quot; Bethel remained an abode
      of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated
      by the king of Assyria (2 Kings 17:28, 29). At length all
      traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of
      Judah (2 Kings 23:15-18); and the place was still in
      existence after the Captivity (Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32). It
      has been identified with the ruins of Beitin, a small
      village amid extensive ruins some 9 miles south of Shiloh.

      with five porches, close to the sheep-gate or market (Neh.
      3:1; John 5:2). Eusebius the historian (A.D. 330) calls it
      &quot;the sheep-pool.&quot; It is also called
      &quot;Bethsaida&quot; and &quot;Beth-zatha&quot; (John 5:2,
      R.V. marg.). Under these &quot;porches&quot; or colonnades
      were usually a large number of infirm people waiting for
      the &quot;troubling of the water.&quot; It is usually
      identified with the modern so-called Fountain of the
      Virgin, in the valley of the Kidron, and not far from the
      Pool of Siloam (q.v.); and also with the Birket Israel, a
      pool near the mouth of the valley which runs into the
      Kidron south of &quot;St. Stephen&#39;s Gate.&quot; Others
      again identify it with the twin pools called the
      &quot;Souterrains,&quot; under the convent of the Sisters
      of Zion, situated in what must have been the rock-hewn
      ditch between Bezetha and the fortress of Antonia. But
      quite recently Schick has discovered a large tank, as
      sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St.
      Anne&#39;s Church, which is, as he contends, very probably
      the Pool of Bethesda. No certainty as to its

      nether.&quot; They are about 2 miles apart, the former
      being about 10 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Between the
      two places was the ascent and descent of Beth-horon,
      leading from Gibeon down to the western plain (Josh. 10:10,
      11; 18:13, 14), down which the five kings of the Amorites
      were driven by Joshua in that great battle, the most
      important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged,
      being their first conflict with their enemies in the open
      field. Jehovah interposed in behalf of Israel by a terrific
      hailstorm, which caused more deaths among the Canaanites
      than did the swords of the Israelites. Beth-horon is
      mentioned as having been taken by Shishak, B.C. 945, in the

      &quot;Bethjesimoth&quot;). It was within the territory of
      Sihon, king of the Amorites (Josh. 12:3).</a>

      <a name="T0000564"><b>Bethlehem -</b> house of bread. (1.)
      A city in the &quot;hill country&quot; of Judah. It was
      originally called Ephrath (Gen. 35:16, 19; 48:7; Ruth
      4:11). It was also called Beth-lehem Ephratah (Micah 5:2),
      Beth-lehem-judah (1 Sam. 17:12), and &quot;the city of
      David&quot; (Luke 2:4). It is first noticed in Scripture as
      the place where Rachel died and was buried &quot;by the
      wayside,&quot; directly to the north of the city (Gen.
      48:7). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of
      Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she
      gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to
      the town. Here was David&#39;s birth-place, and here also,
      in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel (1 Sam.
      16:4-13); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three
      of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their
      lives when he was in the cave of Adullam (2 Sam. 23:13-17).
      But it was distinguished above every other city as the
      birth-place of &quot;Him whose goings forth have been of
      old&quot; (Matt. 2:6; comp. Micah 5:2). Afterwards Herod,
      &quot;when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,&quot;
      sent and slew &quot;all the children that were in
      Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years
      old and under&quot; (Matt. 2:16, 18; Jer. 31:15).</a>

    <p>
      Bethlehem bears the modern name of Beit-Lahm, i.e.,
      &quot;house of flesh.&quot; It is about 5 miles south of
      Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 2,550 feet
      above the sea, thus 100 feet higher than Jerusalem.

    <p>
      There is a church still existing, built by Constantine the
      Great (A.D. 330), called the &quot;Church of the
      Nativity,&quot; over a grotto or cave called the &quot;holy
      crypt,&quot; and said to be the &quot;stable&quot; in which
      Jesus was born. This is perhaps the oldest existing
      Christian church in the world. Close to it is another
      grotto, where Jerome the Latin father is said to have spent
      thirty years of his life in translating the Scriptures into
      Latin. (See <a href=

      two miles up the Jordan. It stood within the region of
      Gaulonitis, and was enlarged by Philip the tetrarch, who
      called it &quot;Julias,&quot; after the emperor&#39;s
      daughter. Or, as some have supposed, there may have been

      name to a district (1 Kings 4:12). The name is found in an
      abridged form, Bethshan, in 1 Sam. 31:10, 12 and 2 Sam.
      21:12. It is on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, about
      5 miles from the Jordan, and 14 from the south end of the
      Lake of Gennesaret. After the Captivity it was called
      Scythopolis, i.e., &quot;the city of the Scythians,&quot;
      who about B.C. 640 came down from the steppes of Southern

      was the scene of an encounter between Jehoash, king of
      Israel, and Amaziah, king of Judah, in which the latter was
      made prisoner (2 Kings 14:11, 13). It was afterwards taken

      the name which in the fifth century began to be given to
      the entire collection of sacred books, the &quot;Library of
      Divine Revelation.&quot; The name Bible was adopted by
      Wickliffe, and came gradually into use in our English
      language. The Bible consists of sixty-six different books,
      composed by many different writers, in three different
      languages, under different circumstances; writers of almost
      every social rank, statesmen and peasants, kings, herdsmen,
      fishermen, priests, tax-gatherers, tentmakers; educated and
      uneducated, Jews and Gentiles; most of them unknown to each
      other, and writing at various periods during the space of
      about 1600 years: and yet, after all, it is only one book
      dealing with only one subject in its numberless aspects and
      relations, the subject of man&#39;s redemption.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is divided into the Old Testament, containing
      thirty-nine books, and the New Testament, containing
      twenty-seven books. The names given to the Old in the
      writings of the New are &quot;the scriptures&quot; (Matt.
      21:42), &quot;scripture&quot; (2 Pet. 1:20), &quot;the holy
      scriptures&quot; (Rom. 1:2), &quot;the law&quot; (John
      12:34), &quot;the law of Moses, the prophets, and the
      psalms&quot; (Luke 24:44), &quot;the law and the
      prophets&quot; (Matt. 5:17), &quot;the old covenant&quot;
      (2 Cor. 3:14, R.V.). There is a break of 400 years between
      the Old Testament and the New. (See <a href=

      APOCRYPHA</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Testament is divided into three parts:, 1. The Law
      (Torah), consisting of the Pentateuch, or five books of
      Moses. 2. The Prophets, consisting of (1) the former,
      namely, Joshua, Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books
      of Kings; (2) the latter, namely, the greater prophets,
      Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the twelve minor
      prophets. 3. The Hagiographa, or holy writings, including
      the rest of the books. These were ranked in three
      divisions:, (1) The Psalms, Proverbs, and Job,
      distinguished by the Hebrew name, a word formed of the
      initial letters of these books, <i>emeth</i>, meaning
      truth. (2) Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and
      Esther, called the five rolls, as being written for the
      synagogue use on five separate rolls. (3) Daniel, Ezra,
      Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles. Between the Old and the
      New Testament no addition was made to the revelation God
      had already given. The period of New Testament revelation,
      extending over a century, began with the appearance of John
      the Baptist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Testament consists of (1) the historical books,
      viz., the Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles; (2) the
      Epistles; and (3) the book of prophecy, the Revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The division of the Bible into chapters and verses is
      altogether of human invention, designed to facilitate
      reference to it. The ancient Jews divided the Old Testament
      into certain sections for use in the synagogue service, and
      then at a later period, in the ninth century A.D., into
      verses. Our modern system of chapters for all the books of
      the Bible was introduced by Cardinal Hugo about the middle
      of the thirteenth century (he died 1263). The system of
      verses for the New Testament was introduced by Stephens in
      1551, and generally adopted, although neither Tyndale&#39;s
      nor Coverdale&#39;s English translation of the Bible has
      verses. The division is not always wisely made, yet it is
      very useful. (See <a href=

      they were not divided as other victims were (Gen. 15:10).
      They are mentioned also as an article of food (Deut.

      Hebrew mother remained forty days in seclusion after the
      birth of a son, and after the birth of a daughter double
      that number of days. At the close of that period she
      entered into the tabernacle or temple and offered up a
      sacrifice of purification (Lev. 12:1-8; Luke 2:22). A son
      was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, being
      thereby consecrated to God (Gen. 17:10-12; comp. Rom.
      4:11). Seasons of misfortune are likened to the pains of a
      woman in travail, and seasons of prosperity to the joy that
      succeeds child-birth (Isa. 13:8; Jer. 4:31; John 16:21,
      22). The natural birth is referred to as the emblem of the
      new birth (John 3:3-8; Gal. 6:15; Titus 3:5, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000591"><b>Birth-day -</b> The observance of
      birth-days was common in early times (Job 1:4, 13, 18).
      They were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt (Gen.
      40:20). There is no recorded instance in Scripture of the
      celebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the occasion
      of Herod&#39;s birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded
      (Matt. 14:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000592"><b>Birthright -</b> (1.) This word
      denotes the special privileges and advantages belonging to
      the first-born son among the Jews. He became the priest of
      the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born of the
      patriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to
      him. That honour was, however, transferred by God from
      Reuben to Levi (Num. 3:12, 13; 8:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The first-born son had allotted to him also a double
      portion of the paternal inheritance (Deut. 21:15-17).
      Reuben was, because of his undutiful conduct, deprived of
      his birth-right (Gen. 49:4; 1 Chr. 5:1). Esau transferred
      his birth-right to Jacob (Gen. 25:33).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The first-born inherited the judicial authority of his
      father, whatever it might be (2 Chr. 21:3). By divine
      appointment, however, David excluded Adonijah in favour of
      Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The Jews attached a sacred importance to the rank of
      &quot;first-born&quot; and &quot;first-begotten&quot; as
      applied to the Messiah (Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:18; Heb. 1:4-6).
      As first-born he has an inheritance superior to his
      brethren, and is the alone true priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000593"><b>Bishop -</b> an overseer. In
      apostolic times, it is quite manifest that there was no
      difference as to order between bishops and elders or
      presbyters (Acts 20:17-28; 1 Pet. 5:1, 2; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim.
      3). The term bishop is never once used to denote a
      different office from that of elder or presbyter. These
      different names are simply titles of the same office,
      &quot;bishop&quot; designating the function, namely, that
      of oversight, and &quot;presbyter&quot; the dignity
      appertaining to the office. Christ is figuratively called
      &quot;the bishop [episcopos] of souls&quot; (1 Pet.
      2:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000594"><b>Bit -</b> the curb put into the
      mouths of horses to restrain them. The Hebrew word (metheg)
      so rendered in Ps. 32:9 is elsewhere translated
      &quot;bridle&quot; (2 Kings 19:28; Prov. 26:3; Isa. 37:29).
      Bits were generally made of bronze or iron, but sometimes
      also of gold or silver. In James 3:3 the Authorized Version
      translates the Greek word by &quot;bits,&quot; but the
      Revised Version by &quot;bridles.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000595"><b>Bith-ron -</b> the broken or divided
      place, a district in the Arabah or Jordan valley, on the
      east of the river (2 Sam. 2:29). It was probably the
      designation of the region in general, which is broken and
      intersected by ravines.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000596"><b>Bithynia -</b> a province in Asia
      Minor, to the south of the Euxine and Propontis. Christian
      congregations were here formed at an early time (1 Pet.
      1:1). Paul was prevented by the Spirit from entering this
      province (Acts 16:7). It is noted in church history as the
      province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul, who was
      perplexed as to the course he should take with the numerous
      Christians brought before his tribunal on account of their
      profession of Christianity and their conduct, and wrote to
      Trajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000597"><b>Bitter -</b> Bitterness is symbolical
      of affliction, misery, and servitude (Ex. 1:14; Ruth 1:20;
      Jer. 9:15). The Chaldeans are called the &quot;bitter and
      hasty nation&quot; (Hab. 1:6). The &quot;gall of
      bitterness&quot; expresses a state of great wickedness
      (Acts 8:23). A &quot;root of bitterness&quot; is a wicked
      person or a dangerous sin (Heb. 12:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Passover was to be eaten with &quot;bitter herbs&quot;
      (Ex. 12:8; Num. 9:11). The kind of herbs so designated is
      not known. Probably they were any bitter herbs obtainable
      at the place and time when the Passover was celebrated.
      They represented the severity of the servitude under which
      the people groaned; and have been regarded also as typical
      of the sufferings of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000598"><b>Bittern -</b> is found three times in
      connection with the desolations to come upon Babylon,
      Idumea, and Nineveh (Isa. 14:23; 34:11; Zeph. 2:14). This
      bird belongs to the class of cranes. Its scientific name is
      Botaurus stellaris. It is a solitary bird, frequenting
      marshy ground. The Hebrew word (kippod) thus rendered in
      the Authorized Version is rendered &quot;porcupine&quot; in
      the Revised Version. But in the passages noted the kippod
      is associated with birds, with pools of water, and with
      solitude and desolation. This favours the idea that not the
      &quot;porcupine&quot; but the &quot;bittern&quot; is really
      intended by the word.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000599"><b>Bitumen -</b> Gen. 11:3, R.V.,
      margin, rendered in the A.V. &quot;slime&quot;), a mineral
      pitch. With this the ark was pitched (6:14. See also Ex.
      2:3.) (See <a href=
