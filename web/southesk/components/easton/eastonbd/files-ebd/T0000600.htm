    <p>
      <a name="T0000600"><b>Black -</b> properly the absence of
      all colour. In Prov. 7:9 the Hebrew word means, as in the
      margin of the Revised Version, &quot;the pupil of the
      eye.&quot; It is translated &quot;apple&quot; of the eye in
      Deut. 32:10; Ps. 17:8; Prov. 7:2. It is a different word
      which is rendered &quot;black&quot; in Lev. 13:31,37; Cant.
      1:5; 5:11; and Zech. 6:2, 6. It is uncertain what the
      &quot;black marble&quot; of Esther 1:6 was which formed a
      part of the mosaic pavement.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000601"><b>Blade -</b> applied to the glittering
      point of a spear (Job 39:23) or sword (Nah. 3:3), the blade
      of a dagger (Judg. 3:22); the &quot;shoulder blade&quot;
      (Job 31:22); the &quot;blade&quot; of cereals (Matt.
      13:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000602"><b>Blains -</b> occurs only in
      connection with the sixth plague of Egypt (Ex. 9:9, 10). In
      Deut. 28:27, 35, it is called &quot;the botch of
      Egypt.&quot; It seems to have been the fearful disease of
      black leprosy, a kind of elephantiasis, producing burning
      ulcers.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000603"><b>Blasphemy -</b> In the sense of
      speaking evil of God this word is found in Ps. 74:18; Isa.
      52:5; Rom. 2:24; Rev. 13:1, 6; 16:9, 11, 21. It denotes
      also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (1
      Kings 21:10; Acts 13:45; 18:6, etc.). Our Lord was accused
      of blasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God (Matt.
      26:65; comp. Matt. 9:3; Mark 2:7). They who deny his
      Messiahship blaspheme Jesus (Luke 22:65; John 10:36).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (Matt. 12:31, 32; Mark
      3:28, 29; Luke 12:10) is regarded by some as a continued
      and obstinate rejection of the gospel, and hence is an
      unpardonable sin, simply because as long as a sinner
      remains in unbelief he voluntarily excludes himself from
      pardon. Others regard the expression as designating the sin
      of attributing to the power of Satan those miracles which
      Christ performed, or generally those works which are the
      result of the Spirit&#39;s agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000604"><b>Blastus -</b> chamberlain to king
      Herod Agrippa I. (Acts 12:20). Such persons generally had
      great influence with their masters.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000605"><b>Blemish -</b> imperfection or bodily
      deformity excluding men from the priesthood, and rendering
      animals unfit to be offered in sacrifice (Lev. 21:17-23;
      22:19-25). The Christian church, as justified in Christ, is
      &quot;without blemish&quot; (Eph. 5:27). Christ offered
      himself a sacrifice &quot;without blemish,&quot; acceptable
      to God (1 Pet. 1:19).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000606"><b>Bless -</b> (1.) God blesses his
      people when he bestows on them some gift temporal or
      spiritual (Gen. 1:22; 24:35; Job 42:12; Ps. 45:2; 104:24,
      35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) We bless God when we thank him for his mercies (Ps.
      103:1, 2; 145:1, 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A man blesses himself when he invokes God&#39;s
      blessing (Isa. 65:16), or rejoices in God&#39;s goodness to
      him (Deut. 29:19; Ps. 49:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) One blesses another when he expresses good wishes or
      offers prayer to God for his welfare (Gen. 24:60; 31:55; 1
      Sam. 2:20). Sometimes blessings were uttered under divine
      inspiration, as in the case of Noah, Isaac, Jacob, and
      Moses (Gen. 9:26, 27; 27:28, 29, 40; 48:15-20; 49:1-28;
      Deut. 33). The priests were divinely authorized to bless
      the people (Deut. 10:8; Num. 6:22-27). We have many
      examples of apostolic benediction (2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 6:23,
      24; 2 Thess. 3:16, 18; Heb. 13:20, 21; 1 Pet. 5:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Among the Jews in their thank-offerings the master of
      the feast took a cup of wine in his hand, and after having
      blessed God for it and for other mercies then enjoyed,
      handed it to his guests, who all partook of it. Ps. 116:13
      refers to this custom. It is also alluded to in 1 Cor.
      10:16, where the apostle speaks of the &quot;cup of
      blessing.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000607"><b>Blind -</b> Blind beggars are
      frequently mentioned (Matt. 9:27; 12:22; 20:30; John 5:3).
      The blind are to be treated with compassion (Lev. 19:14;
      Deut. 27:18). Blindness was sometimes a punishment for
      disobedience (1 Sam. 11:2; Jer. 39:7), sometimes the effect
      of old age (Gen. 27:1; 1 Kings 14:4; 1 Sam. 4:15).
      Conquerors sometimes blinded their captives (2 Kings 25:7;
      1 Sam. 11:2). Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual
      things (Isa. 6:10; 42:18, 19; Matt. 15:14; Eph. 4:18). The
      opening of the eyes of the blind is peculiar to the Messiah
      (Isa. 29:18). Elymas was smitten with blindness at
      Paul&#39;s word (Acts 13:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000608"><b>Blood -</b> (1.) As food, prohibited
      in Gen. 9:4, where the use of animal food is first allowed.
      Comp. Deut. 12:23; Lev. 3:17; 7:26; 17:10-14. The
      injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree
      of the council of Jerusalem (Acts 15:29). It has been held
      by some, and we think correctly, that this law of
      prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others
      regard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by the
      Israelites after the battle of Gilboa (1 Sam.
      14:32-34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The blood of sacrifices was caught by the priest in a
      basin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar; that of
      the passover on the doorposts and lintels of the houses
      (Ex. 12; Lev. 4:5-7; 16:14-19). At the giving of the law
      (Ex. 24:8) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the
      people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were
      consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him,
      hence the blood of the covenant (Matt. 26:28; Heb. 9:19,
      20; 10:29; 13:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Human blood. The murderer was to be punished (Gen.
      9:5). The blood of the murdered &quot;crieth for
      vengeance&quot; (Gen. 4:10). The &quot;avenger of
      blood&quot; was the nearest relative of the murdered, and
      he was required to avenge his death (Num. 35:24, 27). No
      satisfaction could be made for the guilt of murder (Num.
      35:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Blood used metaphorically to denote race (Acts 17:26),
      and as a symbol of slaughter (Isa. 34:3). To &quot;wash the
      feet in blood&quot; means to gain a great victory (Ps.
      58:10). Wine, from its red colour, is called &quot;the
      blood of the grape&quot; (Gen. 49:11). Blood and water
      issued from our Saviour&#39;s side when it was pierced by
      the Roman soldier (John 19:34). This has led pathologists
      to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ&#39;s
      death was rupture of the heart. (Comp. Ps. 69:20.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000609"><b>Bloody sweat -</b> the sign and token
      of our Lord&#39;s great agony (Luke 22:44).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000610"><b>Blot -</b> a stain or reproach (Job
      31:7; Prov. 9:7). To blot out sin is to forgive it (Ps.
      51:1, 9; Isa. 44:22; Acts 3:19). Christ&#39;s blotting out
      the handwriting of ordinances was his fulfilling the law in
      our behalf (Col. 2:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000611"><b>Blue -</b> generally associated with
      purple (Ex. 25:4; 26:1, 31, 36, etc.). It is supposed to
      have been obtained from a shellfish of the Mediterranean,
      the Helix ianthina of Linnaeus. The robe of the high
      priest&#39;s ephod was to be all of this colour (Ex.
      28:31), also the loops of the curtains (26:4) and the
      ribbon of the breastplate (28:28). Blue cloths were also
      made for various sacred purposes (Num. 4:6, 7, 9, 11, 12).

      COLOUR</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000612"><b>Boanerges -</b> sons of thunder, a
      surname given by our Lord to James and John (Mark 3:17) on
      account of their fervid and impetuous temper (Luke
      9:54).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000613"><b>Boar -</b> occurs only in Ps. 80:13.
      The same Hebrew word is elsewhere rendered
      &quot;swine&quot; (Lev. 11:7; Deut. 14:8; Prov. 11:22; Isa.
      65:4; 66:3, 17). The Hebrews abhorred swine&#39;s flesh,
      and accordingly none of these animals were reared, except
      in the district beyond the Sea of Galilee. In the psalm
      quoted above the powers that destroyed the Jewish nation
      are compared to wild boars and wild beasts of the
      field.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000614"><b>Boaz -</b> alacrity. (1.) The husband
      of Ruth, a wealthy Bethlehemite. By the &quot;levirate
      law&quot; the duty devolved on him of marrying Ruth the
      Moabitess (Ruth 4:1-13). He was a kinsman of Mahlon, her
      first husband.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The name given (for what reason is unknown) to one of
      the two (the other was called Jachin) brazen pillars which
      Solomon erected in the court of the temple (1 Kings 7:21; 2
      Chr. 3:17). These pillars were broken up and carried to
      Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000615"><b>Bochim -</b> weepers, a place where
      the angel of the Lord reproved the Israelites for entering
      into a league with the people of the land. This caused them
      bitterly to weep, and hence the name of the place (Judg.
      2:1, 5). It lay probably at the head of one of the valleys
      between Gilgal and Shiloh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000616"><b>Boil -</b> (rendered
      &quot;botch&quot; in Deut. 28:27, 35), an aggravated ulcer,
      as in the case of Hezekiah (2 Kings 20:7; Isa. 38:21) or of
      the Egyptians (Ex. 9:9, 10, 11; Deut. 28:27, 35). It
      designates the disease of Job (2:7), which was probably the
      black leprosy.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000617"><b>Bolled -</b> (Ex. 9:31), meaning
      &quot;swollen or podded for seed,&quot; was adopted in the
      Authorized Version from the version of Coverdale (1535).
      The Revised Version has in the margin &quot;was in
      bloom,&quot; which is the more probable rendering of the
      Hebrew word. It is the fact that in Egypt when barley is in
      ear (about February) flax is blossoming.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000618"><b>Bolster -</b> The Hebrew word <i>
      kebir</i>, rendered &quot;pillow&quot; in 1 Sam. 19:13, 16,
      but in Revised Version marg. &quot;quilt&quot; or
      &quot;network,&quot; probably means some counterpane or
      veil intended to protect the head of the sleeper. A
      different Hebrew word (meraashoth&#39;) is used for
      &quot;bolster&quot; (1 Sam. 26:7, 11, 16). It is rightly
      rendered in Revised Version &quot;at his head.&quot; In
      Gen. 28:11, 18 the Authorized Version renders it &quot;for
      his pillows,&quot; and the Revised Version &quot;under his
      head.&quot; In Ezek. 13:18, 20 another Hebrew word
      (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting &quot;cushions&quot;
      or &quot;pillows,&quot; as so rendered both in the
      Authorized and the Revised Version.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000619"><b>Bond -</b> an obligation of any kind
      (Num. 30:2, 4, 12). The word means also oppression or
      affliction (Ps. 116:16; Phil. 1:7). Christian love is the
      &quot;bond of perfectness&quot; (Col. 3:14), and the
      influences of the Spirit are the &quot;bond of peace&quot;
      (Eph. 4:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000620"><b>Bondage -</b> of Israel in Egypt (Ex.
      2:23, 25; 5), which is called the &quot;house of
      bondage&quot; (13:3; 20:2). This word is used also with
      reference to the captivity in Babylon (Isa. 14:3), and the
      oppression of the Persian king (Ezra 9:8, 9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000621"><b>Bonnet -</b> (Heb. peer), Ex. 39:28
      (R.V., &quot;head-tires&quot;); Ezek. 44:18 (R.V.,
      &quot;tires&quot;), denotes properly a turban worn by
      priests, and in Isa. 3:20 (R.V., &quot;head-tires&quot;) a
      head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so
      rendered literally means an ornament, as in Isa. 61:10
      (R.V., &quot;garland&quot;), and in Ezek. 24:17, 23
      &quot;tire&quot; (R.V., &quot;head-tire&quot;). It
      consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the head. In
      Ex. 28:40; 29:9 it is the translation of a different Hebrew
      word (migba&#39;ah), which denotes the turban (R.V.,
      &quot;head-tire&quot;) of the common priest as
      distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (See <a
      href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002500.html&amp;from=T0002575&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      MITRE</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000622"><b>Book -</b> This word has a
      comprehensive meaning in Scripture. In the Old Testament it
      is the rendering of the Hebrew word <i>sepher</i>, which
      properly means a &quot;writing,&quot; and then a
      &quot;volume&quot; (Ex. 17:14; Deut. 28:58; 29:20; Job
      19:23) or &quot;roll of a book&quot; (Jer. 36:2, 4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Books were originally written on skins, on linen or cotton
      cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word
      &quot;paper.&quot; The leaves of the book were generally
      written in columns, designated by a Hebrew word properly
      meaning &quot;doors&quot; and &quot;valves&quot; (Jer.
      36:23, R.V., marg. &quot;columns&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Hebrews books were generally rolled up like our
      maps, or if very long they were rolled from both ends,
      forming two rolls (Luke 4:17-20). Thus they were arranged
      when the writing was on flexible materials; but if the
      writing was on tablets of wood or brass or lead, then the
      several tablets were bound together by rings through which
      a rod was passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sealed book is one whose contents are secret (Isa. 29:11;
      Rev. 5:1-3). To &quot;eat&quot; a book (Jer. 15:16; Ezek.
      2:8-10; 3:1-3; Rev. 10:9) is to study its contents
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book of judgment (Dan. 7:10) refers to the method of
      human courts of justice as illustrating the proceedings
      which will take place at the day of God&#39;s final
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book of the wars of the Lord (Num. 21:14), the book of
      Jasher (Josh. 10:13), and the book of the chronicles of the
      kings of Judah and Israel (2 Chr. 25:26), were probably
      ancient documents known to the Hebrews, but not forming a
      part of the canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book of life (Ps. 69:28) suggests the idea that as the
      redeemed form a community or citizenship (Phil. 3:20; 4:3),
      a catalogue of the citizens&#39; names is preserved (Luke

      The book of the covenant (Ex. 24:7), containing Ex.
      20:22-23:33, is the first book actually mentioned as a part
      of the written word. It contains a series of laws, civil,
      social, and religious, given to Moses at Sinai immediately
      after the delivery of the decalogue. These were written in
      this &quot;book.&quot;

      branches of a tree. In such tabernacles Jacob sojourned for
      a season at a place named from this circumstance Succoth
      (Gen. 33:17). Booths were erected also at the feast of
      Tabernacles (q.v.), Lev. 23:42, 43, which commemorated the
      abode of the Israelites in the wilderness.</a>

      objects of value taken in war. In Canaan all that breathed
      were to be destroyed (Deut. 20: 16). The &quot;pictures and
      images&quot; of the Canaanites were to be destroyed also
      (Num. 33:52). The law of booty as to its division is laid
      down in Num. 31:26-47. David afterwards introduced a
      regulation that the baggage-guard should share the booty
      equally with the soldiers engaged in battle. He also
      devoted of the spoils of war for the temple (1 Sam.
      30:24-26; 2 Sam. 8:11; 1 Chr. 26:27).</a>

      &quot;asked&quot;) in accordance with a divine command
      (3:22; 11:2). But the word (sha&#39;al) so rendered here
      means simply and always to &quot;request&quot; or
      &quot;demand.&quot; The Hebrew had another word which is
      properly translated &quot;borrow&quot; in Deut. 28:12; Ps.
      37:21. It was well known that the parting was final. The
      Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of
      their land that &quot;they let them have what they
      asked&quot; (Ex. 12:36, R.V.), or literally &quot;made them
      to ask,&quot; urged them to take whatever they desired and
      depart. (See <a href=

      carried in the bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket.
      To have in one&#39;s bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or
      intimacy (Gen. 16:5; 2 Sam. 12:8). Christ is said to have
      been in &quot;the bosom of the Father,&quot; i.e., he had
      the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest
      intimacy with him (John 1:18). John (13:23) was
      &quot;leaning on Jesus&#39; bosom&quot; at the last supper.
      Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a
      tender, watchful care over them (Isa. 40:11).</a>

      <a name="T0000628"><b>Bosses -</b> the projecting parts of
      a shield (Job 15:26). The Hebrew word thus rendered means
      anything convex or arched, and hence the back, as of
      animals.</a>
    </p>

      <a name="T0000629"><b>Botch -</b> the name given in Deut.
      28:27, 35 to one of the Egyptian plagues (Ex. 9:9). The
      word so translated is usually rendered &quot;boil&quot;
      (q.v.).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000630"><b>Bottle -</b> a vessel made of skins
      for holding wine (Josh. 9:4. 13; 1 Sam. 16:20; Matt. 9:17;
      Mark 2:22; Luke 5:37, 38), or milk (Judg. 4:19), or water
      (Gen. 21:14, 15, 19), or strong drink (Hab. 2:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Earthenware vessels were also similarly used (Jer. 19:1-10;
      1 Kings 14:3; Isa. 30:14). In Job 32:19 (comp. Matt. 9:17;
      Luke 5:37, 38; Mark 2:22) the reference is to a wine-skin
      ready to burst through the fermentation of the wine.
      &quot;Bottles of wine&quot; in the Authorized Version of
      Hos. 7:5 is properly rendered in the Revised Version by
      &quot;the heat of wine,&quot; i.e., the fever of wine, its
      intoxicating strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clouds are figuratively called the &quot;bottles of
      heaven&quot; (Job 38:37). A bottle blackened or shrivelled
      by smoke is referred to in Ps. 119:83 as an image to which
      the psalmist likens himself.

      <a name="T0000631"><b>Bow -</b> The bow was in use in early
      times both in war and in the chase (Gen. 21:20; 27:3;
      48:22). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of
      the bow (1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2; 2 Chr. 14:8; 17:17); so also
      were the Elamites (Isa. 22:6) and the Lydians (Jer. 46:9).
      The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to
      tread (1 Chr. 5:18; 8:40), and hence it is concluded that
      the foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel
      (correctly &quot;copper&quot;) are mentioned (2 Sam. 22:35;
      Ps. 18:34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrows were carried in a quiver (Gen. 27:3; Isa. 22:6;
      49:2; Ps. 127:5). They were apparently sometimes shot with
      some burning material attached to them (Ps. 120:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The bow is a symbol of victory (Ps. 7:12). It denotes also
      falsehood, deceit (Ps. 64:3, 4; Hos. 7:16; Jer. 9:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The use of the bow&quot; in 2 Sam. 1:18 (A.V.) ought
      to be &quot;the song of the bow,&quot; as in the Revised
      Version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000632"><b>Bowels -</b> (Phil. 1:8; 2:1; Col.

      mercies.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000633"><b>Bowing -</b> a mode of showing
      respect. Abraham &quot;bowed himself to the people of the
      land&quot; (Gen. 23:7); so Jacob to Esau (Gen. 33:3); and
      the brethren of Joseph before him as the governor of the
      land (Gen. 43:28). Bowing is also frequently mentioned as
      an act of adoration to idols (Josh. 23:7; 2 Kings 5:18;
      Judg. 2:19; Isa. 44:15), and to God (Josh. 5:14; Ps. 22:29;
      72:9; Micah 6:6; Ps. 95:6; Eph. 3:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000634"><b>Bowl -</b> The sockets of the lamps
      of the golden candlestick of the tabernacle are called
      bowls (Ex. 25:31, 33, 34; 37:17, 19, 20); the same word so
      rendered being elsewhere rendered &quot;cup&quot; (Gen.
      44:2, 12, 16), and wine &quot;pot&quot; (Jer. 35:5). The
      reservoir for oil, from which pipes led to each lamp in
      Zechariah&#39;s vision of the candlestick, is called also
      by this name (Zech. 4:2, 3); so also are the vessels used
      for libations (Ex. 25:29; 37:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000635"><b>Box -</b> for holding oil or
      perfumery (Mark 14:3). It was of the form of a flask or
      bottle. The Hebrew word (pak) used for it is more
      appropriately rendered &quot;vial&quot; in 1 Sam. 10:1, and
      should also be so rendered in 2 Kings 9:1, where alone else
      it occurs.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000636"><b>Box-tree -</b> (Heb. teashshur),
      mentioned in Isa. 60:13; 41:19, was, according to some, a
      species of cedar growing in Lebanon. The words of Ezek.
      27:6 literally translated are, &quot;Thy benches they have
      made of ivory, the daughter of the ashur tree,&quot; i.e.,
      inlaid with ashur wood. The ashur is the box-tree, and
      accordingly the Revised Version rightly reads &quot;inlaid
      in box wood.&quot; This is the Buxus sempervirens of
      botanists. It is remarkable for the beauty of its evergreen
      foliage and for the utility of its hard and durable
      wood.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000637"><b>Bozrah -</b> enclosure; fortress.
      (1.) The city of Jobab, one of the early Edomite kings
      (Gen. 36:33). This place is mentioned by the prophets in
      later times (Isa. 34:6; Jer. 49:13; Amos 1:12; Micah 2:12).
      Its modern representative is el-Busseireh. It lies in the
      mountain district of Petra, 20 miles to the south-east of
      the Dead Sea.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Moabite city in the &quot;plain country&quot; (Jer.
      48:24), i.e., on the high level down on the east of the
      Dead Sea. It is probably the modern Buzrah.

      (2.) The rendering of a Hebrew word meaning fasteners,
      found in Gen. 24:22, 30, 47.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In Isa. 3:19, the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning
      chains, i.e., twisted or chain-like bracelets.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) In Ex. 35:22 it designates properly a clasp for
      fastening the dress of females. Some interpret it as a
      nose-ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) In Gen. 38:18, 25, the rendering of a Hebrew word
      meaning &quot;thread,&quot; and may denote the ornamental
      cord with which the signet was suspended from the neck of
      the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bracelets were worn by men as well as by women (Cant. 5:14,
      R.V.). They were of many various forms. The weight of those
      presented by Eliezer to Rebekah was ten shekels (Gen.
      24:22).

      descended from royal ancestors (Ezek. 17:3, 10; Dan. 11:7);
      of prosperity (Job 8:16); of the Messiah, a branch out of
      the root of the stem of Jesse (Isa. 11:1), the
      &quot;beautiful branch&quot; (4:2), a &quot;righteous
      branch&quot; (Jer. 23:5), &quot;the Branch&quot; (Zech.
      3:8; 6:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Disciples are branches of the true vine (John 15:5, 6).
      &quot;The branch of the terrible ones&quot; (Isa. 25:5) is
      rightly translated in the Revised Version &quot;the song of
      the terrible ones,&quot; i.e., the song of victory shall be
      brought low by the destruction of Babylon and the return of
      the Jews from captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;abominable branch&quot; is a tree on which a
      malefactor has been hanged (Isa. 14:19). The &quot;highest
      branch&quot; in Ezek. 17:3 represents Jehoiakim the king.

      <a name="T0000641"><b>Brass -</b> which is an alloy of
      copper and zinc, was not known till the thirteenth century.
      What is designated by this word in Scripture is properly
      copper (Deut. 8:9). It was used for fetters (Judg. 16:21; 2
      Kings 25:7), for pieces of armour (1 Sam. 17:5, 6), for
      musical instruments (1 Chr. 15:19; 1 Cor. 13:1), and for
      money (Matt. 10:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a symbol of insensibility and obstinacy in sin (Isa.
      48:4; Jer. 6:28; Ezek. 22:18), and of strength (Ps. 107:16;
      Micah 4:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macedonian empire is described as a kingdom of brass
      (Dan. 2:39). The &quot;mountains of brass&quot; Zechariah
      (6:1) speaks of have been supposed to represent the
      immutable decrees of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serpent of brass was made by Moses at the command of
      God (Num. 21:4-9), and elevated on a pole, so that it might
      be seen by all the people when wounded by the bite of the
      serpents that were sent to them as a punishment for their
      murmurings against God and against Moses. It was afterwards
      carried by the Jews into Canaan, and preserved by them till
      the time of Hezekiah, who caused it to be at length
      destroyed because it began to be viewed by the people with
      superstitious reverence (2 Kings 18:4). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000644"><b>Bread -</b> among the Jews was
      generally made of wheat (Ex. 29:2; Judg. 6:19), though also
      sometimes of other grains (Gen. 14:18; Judg. 7:13). Parched
      grain was sometimes used for food without any other
      preparation (Ruth 2:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bread was prepared by kneading in wooden bowls or
      &quot;kneading troughs&quot; (Gen. 18:6; Ex. 12:34; Jer.
      7:18). The dough was mixed with leaven and made into thin
      cakes, round or oval, and then baked. The bread eaten at
      the Passover was always unleavened (Ex. 12:15-20; Deut.
      16:3). In the towns there were public ovens, which were
      much made use of for baking bread; there were also bakers
      by trade (Hos. 7:4; Jer. 37:21). Their ovens were not
      unlike those of modern times. But sometimes the bread was
      baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by
      a fire, and by covering it with the embers (1 Kings 19:6).
      This was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on
      the occasion referred to in Gen. 18:6.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lev. 2 there is an account of the different kinds of
      bread and cakes used by the Jews. (See <a href=

      The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of
      unleavened bread prepared and presented hot on the golden
      table every Sabbath. They were square or oblong, and
      represented the twelve tribes of Israel. The old loaves
      were removed every Sabbath, and were to be eaten only by
      the priests in the court of the sanctuary (Ex. 25:30; Lev.
      24:8; 1 Sam. 21:1-6; Matt. 12:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as
      &quot;bread of sorrows&quot; (Ps. 127:2), &quot;bread of
      tears&quot; (80:5), i.e., sorrow and tears are like
      one&#39;s daily bread, they form so great a part in life.
      The bread of &quot;wickedness&quot; (Prov. 4:17) and
      &quot;of deceit&quot; (20:17) denote in like manner that
      wickedness and deceit are a part of the daily life.

      row. On each stone was engraved the name of one of the
      twelve tribes (Ex. 28:15-29; 39:8-21). It was in size about
      ten inches square. The two upper corners were fastened to
      the ephod by blue ribbons. It was not to be &quot;loosed
      from the ephod&quot; (Ex. 28:28). The lower corners were
      fastened to the girdle of the priest. As it reminded the
      priest of his representative character, it was called the

      the chief labour of the Israelites in Egypt (Ex. 1:13, 14).
      Those found among the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh are
      about a foot square and four inches thick. They were
      usually dried in the sun, though also sometimes in kilns (2
      Sam. 12:31; Jer. 43:9; Nah. 3:14). (See <a href=

      The bricks used in the tower of Babel were burnt bricks,
      cemented in the building by bitumen (Gen. 11:3).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000649"><b>Bride -</b> frequently used in the
      ordinary sense (Isa. 49:18; 61:10, etc.). The relation
      between Christ and his church is set forth under the figure
      of that between a bridegroom and bride (John 3:29). The
      church is called &quot;the bride&quot; (Rev. 21:9; 22:17).
      Compare parable of the Ten Virgins (Matt. 25:1-13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000650"><b>Bridle -</b> Three Hebrew words are
      thus rendered in the Authorized Version. (1.) Heb. <i>
      mahsom&#39;</i> signifies a muzzle or halter or bridle, by
      which the rider governs his horse (Ps.39:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) <i>Me&#39;theg</i>, rendered also &quot;bit&quot; in
      Ps. 32:9, which is its proper meaning. Found in 2 Kings
      19:28, where the restraints of God&#39;s providence are
      metaphorically styled his &quot;bridle&quot; and
      &quot;hook.&quot; God&#39;s placing a &quot;bridle in the
      jaws of the people&quot; (Isa. 30:28; 37:29) signifies his
      preventing the Assyrians from carrying out their purpose
      against Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Another word, <i>re&#39;sen</i>, was employed to
      represent a halter or bridle-rein, as used Ps. 32:9; Isa.
      30:28. In Job 30:11 the restraints of law and humanity are
      called a bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000651"><b>Brier -</b> This word occurs
      frequently, and is the translation of several different
      terms. (1.) Micah 7:4, it denotes a species of thorn shrub
      used for hedges. In Prov. 15:19 the word is rendered
      &quot;thorn&quot; (Heb. <i>hedek</i>,
      &quot;stinging&quot;), supposed by some to be what is
      called the &quot;apple of Sodom&quot; (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Ezek. 28:24, <i>sallon&#39;</i>, properly a
      &quot;prickle,&quot; such as is found on the shoots of the
      palm tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Isa. 55:13, probably simply a thorny bush. Some,
      following the Vulgate Version, regard it as the
      &quot;nettle.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Isa. 5:6; 7:23-25, etc., frequently used to denote
      thorny shrubs in general. In 10:17; 27:4, it means
      troublesome men.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) In Heb. 6:8 the Greek word (tribolos) so rendered
      means &quot;three-pronged,&quot; and denotes the land
      caltrop, a low throny shrub resembling in its spikes the
      military &quot;crow-foot.&quot; Comp. Matt. 7:16,

    <p>
      <a name="T0000653"><b>Brimstone -</b> an inflammable
      mineral substance found in quantities on the shores of the
      Dead Sea. The cities of the plain were destroyed by a rain
      of fire and brimstone (Gen. 19:24, 25). In Isa. 34:9
      allusion is made to the destruction of these cities. This
      word figuratively denotes destruction or punishment (Job
      18:15; Isa. 30:33; 34:9; Ps. 11:6; Ezek. 38:22). It is used
      to express the idea of excruciating torment in Rev. 14:10;
      19:20; 20:10.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000654"><b>Brook -</b> a torrent. (1.) Applied
      to small streams, as the Arnon, Jabbok, etc. Isaiah (15:7)
      speaks of the &quot;book of the willows,&quot; probably the
      Wady-el-Asha. (2.) It is also applied to winter torrents
      (Job 6:15; Num. 34:5; Josh. 15:4, 47), and to the
      torrent-bed or wady as well as to the torrent itself (Num.
      13:23; 1 Kings 17:3). (3.) In Isa. 19:7 the river Nile is
      meant, as rendered in the Revised Version.</a>

      (2.) A near relation, a cousin (Gen. 13:8; 14:16; Matt.
      12:46; John 7:3; Acts 1:14; Gal. 1:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Simply a fellow-countryman (Matt. 5:47; Acts 3:22;
      Heb. 7:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A disciple or follower (Matt. 25:40; Heb. 2:11, 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) One of the same faith (Amos 1:9; Acts 9:30; 11:29; 1
      Cor. 5:11); whence the early disciples of our Lord were
      known to each other as brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) A colleague in office (Ezra 3:2; 1 Cor. 1:1; 2 Cor.
      1:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) A fellow-man (Gen. 9:5; 19:7; Matt. 5:22, 23, 24; 7:5;
      Heb. 2:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) One beloved or closely united with another in
      affection (2 Sam. 1:26; Acts 6:3; 1 Thess. 5:1). Brethren
      of Jesus (Matt. 1:25; 12:46, 50: Mark 3:31, 32; Gal. 1:19;
      1 Cor. 9:5, etc.) were probably the younger children of
      Joseph and Mary. Some have supposed that they may have been
      the children of Joseph by a former marriage, and others
      that they were the children of Mary, the Virgin&#39;s
      sister, and wife of Cleophas. The first interpretation,
      however, is the most natural.

      with (Isa. 40:15); used figuratively, probably, of a
      numerous issue (Num. 24:7).</a>

      <a name="T0000658"><b>Buckler -</b> (1.) A portable shield
      (2 Sam. 22:31; 1 Chr. 5:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A shield surrounding the person; the targe or round
      form; used once figuratively (Ps. 91:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A large shield protecting the whole body (Ps. 35:2;
      Ezek. 23:24; 26:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A lance or spear; improperly rendered
      &quot;buckler&quot; in the Authorized Version (1 Chr.
      12:8), but correctly in the Revised Version
      &quot;spear.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The leather of shields required oiling (2 Sam. 1:21; Isa.
      21:5), so as to prevent its being injured by moisture.
      Copper (= &quot;brass&quot;) shields were also in use (1
      Sam. 17:6; 1 Kings 14:27). Those spoken of in 1 Kings
      10:16, etc.; 14:26, were probably of massive metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shields David had taken from his enemies were suspended
      in the temple as mementoes (2 Kings 11:10). (See ARMOUR

    <p>
      <a name="T0000659"><b>Building -</b> among the Jews was
      suited to the climate and conditions of the country. They
      probably adopted the kind of architecture for their
      dwellings which they found already existing when they
      entered Canaan (Deut. 6:10; Num. 13:19). Phoenician artists
      (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Kings 5:6, 18) assisted at the erection of
      the royal palace and the temple at Jerusalem. Foreigners
      also assisted at the restoration of the temple after the
      Exile (Ezra 3:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gen. 11:3, 9, we have the first recorded instance of the
      erection of buildings. The cities of the plain of Shinar
      were founded by the descendants of Shem (10:11, 12, 22).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Israelites were by occupation shepherds and dwellers in
      tents (Gen. 47:3); but from the time of their entering
      Canaan they became dwellers in towns, and in houses built
      of the native limestone of Palestine. Much building was
      carried on in Solomon&#39;s time. Besides the buildings he
      completed at Jerusalem, he also built Baalath and Tadmor (1
      Kings 9:15, 24). Many of the kings of Israel and Judah were
      engaged in erecting various buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herod and his sons and successors restored the temple, and
      built fortifications and other structures of great
      magnificence in Jerusalem (Luke 21:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The instruments used in building are mentioned as the
      plumb-line (Amos 7:7), the measuring-reed (Ezek. 40:3), and
      the saw (1 Kings 7:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Believers are &quot;God&#39;s building&quot; (1 Cor. 3:9);
      and heaven is called &quot;a building of God&quot; (2 Cor.
      5:1). Christ is the only foundation of his church (1 Cor.
      3:10-12), of which he also is the builder (Matt. 16:18).

      <a name="T0000661"><b>Bullock -</b> (1.) The translation of
      a word which is a generic name for horned cattle (Isa.
      65:25). It is also rendered &quot;cow&quot; (Ezek. 4:15),
      &quot;ox&quot; (Gen. 12:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The translation of a word always meaning an animal of
      the ox kind, without distinction of age or sex (Hos.
      12:11). It is rendered &quot;cow&quot; (Num. 18:17) and
      &quot;ox&quot; (Lev. 17:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Another word is rendered in the same way (Jer. 31:18).
      It is also translated &quot;calf&quot; (Lev. 9:3; Micah
      6:6). It is the same word used of the &quot;molten
      calf&quot; (Ex. 32:4, 8) and &quot;the golden calf&quot; (1
      Kings 12:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) In Judg. 6:25; Isa. 34:7, the Hebrew word is
      different. It is the customary word for bulls offered in
      sacrifice. In Hos. 14:2, the Authorized Version has
      &quot;calves,&quot; the Revised Version
      &quot;bullocks.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0000662"><b>Bulrush -</b> (1.) In Isa. 58:5 the
      rendering of a word which denotes &quot;belonging to a
      marsh,&quot; from the nature of the soil in which it grows
      (Isa. 18:2). It was sometimes platted into ropes (Job.
      41:2; A.V., &quot;hook,&quot; R.V., &quot;rope,&quot; lit.
      &quot;cord of rushes&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) In Ex. 2:3, Isa. 18:2 (R.V., &quot;papyrus&quot;) this
      word is the translation of the Hebrew <i>gome</i>, which
      designates the plant as absorbing moisture. In Isa. 35:7
      and Job 8:11 it is rendered &quot;rush.&quot; This was the
      Egyptian papyrus (papyrus Nilotica). It was anciently very
      abundant in Egypt. The Egyptians made garments and shoes
      and various utensils of it. It was used for the
      construction of the ark of Moses (Ex. 2:3, 5). The root
      portions of the stem were used for food. The inside bark
      was cut into strips, which were sewed together and dried in
      the sun, forming the papyrus used for writing. It is no
      longer found in Egypt, but grows luxuriantly in Palestine,
      in the marshes of the Huleh, and in the swamps at the north
      end of the Lake of Gennesaret. (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0000665"><b>Burden -</b> (1.) A load of any kind
      (Ex. 23:5). (2.) A severe task (Ex. 2:11). (3.) A difficult
      duty, requiring effort (Ex. 18:22). (4.) A prophecy of a
      calamitous or disastrous nature (Isa. 13:1; 17:1; Hab. 1:1,
      etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000666"><b>Burial -</b> The first burial we have
      an account of is that of Sarah (Gen. 23). The first
      commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of
      a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron
      &quot;four hundred shekels of silver current money with the
      merchants.&quot; Thus the patriarch became the owner of a
      part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever
      possessed. When he himself died, &quot;his sons Isaac and
      Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,&quot; beside
      Sarah his wife (Gen. 25:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Deborah, Rebekah&#39;s nurse, was buried under
      Allon-bachuth, &quot;the oak of weeping&quot; (Gen. 35:8),
      near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath;
      &quot;and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave&quot; (16-20).
      Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29).
      Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of
      Machpelah, said, &quot;There they buried Abraham and Sarah
      his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and
      there I buried Leah&quot; (49:31). In compliance with the
      oath which he made him swear unto him (47:29-31), Joseph,
      assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of
      Machpelah (50:2, 13). At the Exodus, Moses &quot;took the
      bones of Joseph with him,&quot; and they were buried in the
      &quot;parcel of ground&quot; which Jacob had bought of the
      sons of Hamor (Josh. 24:32), which became Joseph&#39;s
      inheritance (Gen. 48:22; 1 Chr. 5:1; John 4:5). Two burials
      are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That
      of Miriam (Num. 20:1), and that of Moses, &quot;in the land
      of Moab&quot; (Deut. 34:5, 6, 8). There is no account of
      the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took
      place on the summit of Mount Hor (Num. 20:28, 29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua was buried &quot;in the border of his inheritance in
      Timnath-serah&quot; (Josh. 24: 30).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were
      probably the Pyramids (3:14, 15). The Hebrew word for
      &quot;waste places&quot; here resembles in sound the
      Egyptian word for &quot;pyramids.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel, like Moses, was honoured with a national burial (1
      Sam. 25:1). Joab (1 Kings 2:34) &quot;was buried in his own
      house in the wilderness.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with the burial of Saul and his three sons we
      meet for the first time with the practice of burning the
      dead (1 Sam. 31:11-13). The same practice is again referred
      to by Amos (6:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom was buried &quot;in the wood&quot; where he was
      slain (2 Sam. 18:17, 18). The raising of the heap of stones
      over his grave was intended to mark abhorrence of the
      person buried (comp. Josh. 7:26 and 8:29). There was no
      fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find
      several royal burials taking place, however, &quot;in the
      city of David&quot; (1 Kings 2:10; 11:43; 15:8; 2 Kings
      14:19, 20; 15:38; 1 Kings 14:31; 22:50; 2 Chr. 21:19, 20; 2
      Chr. 24:25, etc.). Hezekiah was buried in the mount of the
      sepulchres of the sons of David; &quot;and all Judah and
      the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
      death&quot; (2 Chr. 32:33).
    </p>
    <p>
      Little is said regarding the burial of the kings of Israel.
      Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of their
      kingdom (2 Kings 10:35; 13:9; 14:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock,
      which Joseph of Arimathea had prepared for himself (Matt.
      27:57-60; Mark 15:46; John 19:41, 42).
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave of Lazarus was &quot;a cave, and a stone lay on
      it&quot; (John 11:38). Graves were frequently either
      natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in the
      sides of rocks (Gen. 23:9; Matt. 27:60); and coffins were
      seldom used, unless when the body was brought from a
      distance.

      olah</i>; i.e., &quot;ascending,&quot; the whole being
      consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while
      being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the
      sacred fire, but this was wholly burnt, a &quot;whole burnt
      offering.&quot; It was the most frequent form of sacrifice,
      and apparently the only one mentioned in the book of
      Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel (Gen.
      4:3, 4, here called <i>minhah</i>; i.e., &quot;a
      gift&quot;), Noah (Gen. 8:20), Abraham (Gen. 22:2, 7, 8,
      13), and by the Hebrews in Egypt (Ex. 10:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The law of Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and
      the manner in which burnt sacrifices were to be offered.
      There were &quot;the continual burnt offering&quot; (Ex.
      29:38-42; Lev. 6:9-13), &quot;the burnt offering of every
      sabbath,&quot; which was double the daily one (Num. 28:9,
      10), &quot;the burnt offering of every month&quot;
      (28:11-15), the offerings at the Passover (19-23), at
      Pentecost (Lev. 23:16), the feast of Trumpets (23:23-25),
      and on the day of Atonement (Lev. 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at
      the consecration of Aaron (Ex. 29) and the dedication of
      the temple (1 Kings 8:5, 62-64).
    </p>
    <p>
      Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted (Lev. 1:13),
      and were offered at the accession of Solomon to the throne
      (1 Chr. 29:21), and at the reformation brought about by
      Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29: 31-35).
    </p>
    <p>
      These offerings signified the complete dedication of the
      offerers unto God. This is referred to in Rom. 12:1. (See

      this title is given to various emperors as sovereigns of
      Judaea without their accompanying distinctive proper names
      (John 19:15; Acts 17:7). The Jews paid tribute to Caesar
      (Matt. 22:17), and all Roman citizens had the right of
      appeal to him (Acts 25:11). The Caesars referred to in the
      New Testament are Augustus (Luke 2:1), Tiberius (3:1;
      20:22), Claudius (Acts 11:28), and Nero (Acts 25:8; Phil.

      of Jerusalem, and 20 miles north of the Sea of Galilee, at
      the &quot;upper source&quot; of the Jordan, and near the
      base of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in Matt. 16:13 and
      Mark 8:27 as the northern limit of our Lord&#39;s public
      ministry. According to some its original name was Baal-Gad
      (Josh. 11:17), or Baal-Hermon (Judg. 3:3; 1 Chr. 5:23),
      when it was a Canaanite sanctuary of Baal. It was
      afterwards called Panium or Paneas, from a deep cavern full
      of water near the town. This name was given to the cavern
      by the Greeks of the Macedonian kingdom of Antioch because
      of its likeness to the grottos of Greece, which were always
      associated with the worship of their god Pan. Its modern
      name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple, which he
      dedicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards
      enlarged and embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of
      Trachonitis, of whose territory it formed a part, and was
      called by him Caesarea Philippi, partly after his own name,
      and partly after that of the emperor Tiberius Caesar. It is
      thus distinguished from the Caesarea of Palestine. (See <a

      <a name="T0000682"><b>Caesarea -</b> (Palestinae), a city
      on the shore of the Mediterranean, on the great road from
      Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles northwest of Jerusalem, at
      the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon. It was built
      by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar
      Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos =
      &quot;Augustus&quot;), on the site of an old town called
      &quot;Strato&#39;s Tower.&quot; It was the capital of the
      Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or
      procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It
      was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious
      artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of
      great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of
      the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted
      through the instrumentality of Peter (Acts 10:1, 24), and
      thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the
      Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four
      daughters (21:8). From this place Saul sailed for his
      native Tarsus when forced to flee from Jerusalem (9:30),
      and here he landed when returning from his second
      missionary journey (18:22). He remained as a prisoner here
      for two years before his voyage to Rome (Acts 24:27; 25:1,
      4, 6, 13). Here on a &quot;set day,&quot; when games were
      celebrated in the theatre in honour of the emperor
      Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in
      great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid
      to him was suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a
      dying man. He was &quot;eaten of worms&quot; (12:19-23),
      thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his
      granfather, Herod the Great. It still retains its ancient
      name Kaiseriyeh, but is now desolate. &quot;The present
      inhabitants of the ruins are snakes, scorpions, lizards,
      wild boars, and jackals.&quot; It is described as the most
      desolate city of all Palestine.</a>

      (A.D. 27-36) at the beginning of our Lord&#39;s public
      ministry, in the reign of Tiberius (Luke 3:2), and also at
      the time of his condemnation and crucifixion (Matt.
      26:3,57; John 11:49; 18:13, 14). He held this office during
      the whole of Pilate&#39;s administration. His wife was the
      daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and
      was probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas.
      He was of the sect of the Sadducees (Acts 5:17), and was a
      member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus
      should be put to death &quot;for the people, and that the
      whole nation perish not&quot; (John 11:50). In these words
      he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. &quot;Like Saul, he
      was a prophet in spite of himself.&quot; Caiaphas had no
      power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore
      Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might
      duly pronounce the sentence against him (Matt. 27:2; John
      18:28). At a later period his hostility to the gospel is
      still manifest (Acts 4:6). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000685"><b>Cain -</b> a possession; a spear.
      (1.) The first-born son of Adam and Eve (Gen. 4). He became
      a tiller of the ground, as his brother Abel followed the
      pursuits of pastoral life. He was &quot;a sullen,
      self-willed, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the religious
      element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude
      towards God.&quot; It came to pass &quot;in process of
      time&quot; (marg. &quot;at the end of days&quot;), i.e.,
      probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented
      their offerings to the Lord. Abel&#39;s offering was of the
      &quot;firstlings of his flock and of the fat,&quot; while
      Cain&#39;s was &quot;of the fruit of the ground.&quot;
      Abel&#39;s sacrifice was &quot;more excellent&quot; (Heb.
      11:4) than Cain&#39;s, and was accepted by God. On this
      account Cain was &quot;very wroth,&quot; and cherished
      feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was
      at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to
      death (1 John 3:12). For this crime he was expelled from
      Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon
      him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his
      own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected
      from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God
      only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be
      slain (Gen. 4:15). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive
      in the earth, he went forth into the &quot;land of
      Nod&quot;, i.e., the land of &quot;exile&quot;, which is
      said to have been in the &quot;east of Eden,&quot; and
      there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it
      after his son&#39;s name, Enoch. His descendants are
      enumerated to the sixth generation. They gradually
      degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till
      they became wholly corrupt before God. This corruption
      prevailed, and at length the Deluge was sent by God to
      prevent the final triumph of evil. (See <a href=

      cakes or wafers were offered &quot;to the queen of
      heaven&quot; (Jer. 7:18; 44:19).</a>

      Pancakes are described in 2 Sam. 13:8, 9. Cakes mingled

      and &quot;wafers unleavened anointed with oil,&quot; in Ex.
      29:2; Lev. 8:26; 1 Chr. 23:29. &quot;Cracknels,&quot; a
      kind of crisp cakes, were among the things Jeroboam
      directed his wife to take with her when she went to consult
      Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh (1 Kings 14:3). Such hard
      cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to
      Joshua (9:5, 12). They described their bread as
      &quot;mouldy;&quot; but the Hebrew word <i>nikuddim</i>,
      here used, ought rather to be rendered &quot;hard as
      biscuit.&quot; It is rendered &quot;cracknels&quot; in 1
      Kings 14:3. The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days,
      became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to
      this hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had
      come a long journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      We read also of honey-cakes (Ex. 16:31), &quot;cakes of
      figs&quot; (1 Sam. 25:18), &quot;cake&quot; as denoting a
      whole piece of bread (1 Kings 17:12), and &quot;a [round]
      cake of barley bread&quot; (Judg. 7:13). In Lev. 2 is a
      list of the different kinds of bread and cakes which were
      fit for offerings.

      now marked probably by the Nimrud ruins on the left bank of
      the Tigris. These cover an area of about 1,000 acres, and
      are second only in size and importance to the mass of ruins
      opposite Mosul. This city was at one time the capital of
      the empire, and was the residence of Sardanapalus and his
      successors down to the time of Sargon, who built a new
      capital, the modern Khorsabad. It has been conjectured that
      these four cities mentioned in Gen. 10:11 were afterwards

      markets of Tyre (Ezek. 27:19). The word designates an
      Oriental plant called the &quot;sweet flag,&quot; the
      Acorus calamus of Linnaeus. It is elsewhere called
      &quot;sweet cane&quot; (Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20). It has an
      aromatic smell, and when its knotted stalk is cut and dried
      and reduced to powder, it forms an ingredient in the most
      precious perfumes. It was not a native of Palestine, but
      was imported from Arabia Felix or from India. It was
      probably that which is now known in India by the name of

      (2.) A &quot;son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah&quot; (1
      Chr. 2:50). Some would read the whole passage thus:
      &quot;These [i.e., the list in ver. 42-49] were the sons of
      Caleb. The sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, were
      Shobal, etc.&quot; Thus Hur would be the name of the son
      and not the father of Caleb (ver. 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The son of Jephunneh (Num. 13:6; 32:12; Josh. 14:6,
      14). He was one of those whom Moses sent to search the land
      in the second year after the Exodus. He was one of the
      family chiefs of the tribe of Judah. He and Joshua the son
      of Nun were the only two of the whole number who encouraged
      the people to go up and possess the land, and they alone
      were spared when a plague broke out in which the other ten
      spies perished (Num. 13; 14). All the people that had been
      numbered, from twenty years old and upward, perished in the
      wilderness except these two. The last notice we have of
      Caleb is when (being then eighty-five years of age) he came
      to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, after the people had
      gained possession of the land, and reminded him of the
      promise Moses had made to him, by virtue of which he
      claimed a certain portion of the land of Kirjath-arba as
      his inheritance (Josh. 14:6-15; 15:13-15; 21:10-12; 1 Sam.
      25:2,3; 30:14). He is called a &quot;Kenezite&quot; in
      Josh. 14:6,14. This may simply mean &quot;son of
      Kenez&quot; (Num. 32:12). Some, however, read
      &quot;Jephunneh, the son of Kenez,&quot; who was a
      descendant of Hezron, the son of Pharez, a grandson of
      Judah (1 Chr. 2:5). This Caleb may possibly be identical
      with (2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Caleb gave his name apparently to a part of the south
      country (1 Sam. 30:14) of Judah, the district between
      Hebron and Carmel, which had been assigned to him. When he
      gave up the city of Hebron to the priests as a city of
      refuge, he retained possession of the surrounding country
      (Josh. 21:11,12; comp. 1 Sam. 25:3).

      <a name="T0000692"><b>Calf -</b> Calves were commonly made
      use of in sacrifices, and are therefore frequently
      mentioned in Scripture. The &quot;fatted calf&quot; was
      regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was frequently
      also offered as a special sacrifice (1 Sam. 28:24; Amos
      6:4; Luke 15:23). The words used in Jer. 34:18, 19,
      &quot;cut the calf in twain,&quot; allude to the custom of
      dividing a sacrifice into two parts, between which the
      parties ratifying a covenant passed (Gen. 15:9, 10, 17,
      18). The sacrifice of the lips, i.e., priase, is called
      &quot;the calves of our lips&quot; (Hos. 14:2, R.V.,
      &quot;as bullocks the offering of our lips.&quot; Comp.
      Heb. 13:15; Ps. 116:7; Jer. 33:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden calf which Aaron made (Ex. 32:4) was probably a
      copy of the god Moloch rather than of the god Apis, the
      sacred ox or calf of Egypt. The Jews showed all through
      their history a tendency toward the Babylonian and
      Canaanitish idolatry rather than toward that of Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ages after this, Jeroboam, king of Israel, set up two idol
      calves, one at Dan, and the other at Bethel, that he might
      thus prevent the ten tribes from resorting to Jerusalem for
      worship (1 Kings 12:28). These calves continued to be a
      snare to the people till the time of their captivity. The
      calf at Dan was carried away in the reign of Pekah by
      Tiglath-pileser, and that at Bethel ten years later, in the
      reign of Hoshea, by Shalmaneser (2 Kings 15:29; 17:33).
      This sin of Jeroboam is almost always mentioned along with
      his name (2 Kings 15:28 etc.).

      inhabitants of Gebel were employed in such work on Tyrian
      vessels (Ezek. 27:9, 27; marg., &quot;strengtheners&quot;

      <a name="T0000694"><b>Call -</b> (1.) To cry for help,
      hence to pray (Gen. 4:26). Thus men are said to &quot;call
      upon the name of the Lord&quot; (Acts 2:21; 7:59; 9:14;
      Rom. 10:12; 1 Cor. 1:2).</a>

    <p>
      (2.) God calls with respect to men when he designates them
      to some special office (Ex. 31:2; Isa. 22:20; Acts 13:2),
      and when he invites them to accept his offered grace (Matt.
      9:13; 11:28; 22:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the message of the gospel his call is addressed to all
      men, to Jews and Gentiles alike (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15;
      Rom. 9:24, 25). But this universal call is not inseparably
      connected with salvation, although it leaves all to whom it
      comes inexcusable if they reject it (John 3:14-19; Matt.
      22:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      An effectual call is something more than the outward
      message of the Word of God to men. It is internal, and is
      the result of the enlightening and sanctifying influence of
      the Holy Spirit (John 16:14; Acts 26: 18; John 6:44),
      effectually drawing men to Christ, and disposing and
      enabling them to receive the truth (John 6:45; Acts 16:14;
      Eph. 1:17).

      your being called into the kingdom of God.</a>

      <a name="T0000696"><b>Calneh -</b> fort, one of the four

      Niffer, a lofty mound of earth and rubbish situated in the
      marshes on the left, i.e., the east, bank of the Euphrates,
      but 30 miles distant from its present course, and about 60
      miles south-south-east from Babylon. It is mentioned as one
      of the towns with which Tyre carried on trade. It was
      finally taken and probably destroyed by one of the Assyrian
      kings (Amos 6:2). It is called Calno (Isa. 10:9) and Canneh
      (Ezek. 27:23).</a>

      <a name="T0000697"><b>Calvary -</b> only in Luke 23:33, the
      Latin name Calvaria, which was used as a translation of the
      Greek word <i>Kranion</i>, by which the Hebrew word <i>
      Gulgoleth</i> was interpreted, &quot;the place of a
      skull.&quot; It probably took this name from its shape,
      being a hillock or low, rounded, bare elevation somewhat in
      the form of a human skull. It is nowhere in Scripture
      called a &quot;hill.&quot; The crucifixion of our Lord took
      place outside the city walls (Heb. 13:11-13) and near the

      <a name="T0000698"><b>Camel -</b> from the Hebrew <i>
      gamal</i>, &quot;to repay&quot; or &quot;requite,&quot; as
      the camel does the care of its master. There are two
      distinct species of camels, having, however, the common
      characteristics of being &quot;ruminants without horns,
      without muzzle, with nostrils forming oblique slits, the
      upper lip divided and separately movable and extensile, the
      soles of the feet horny, with two toes covered by claws,
      the limbs long, the abdomen drawn up, while the neck, long
      and slender, is bent up and down, the reverse of that of a
      horse, which is arched.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The Bactrian camel is distinguished by two humps. It
      is a native of the high table-lands of Central Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The Arabian camel or dromedary, from the Greek <i>
      dromos</i>, &quot;a runner&quot; (Isa. 60:6; Jer. 2:23),
      has but one hump, and is a native of Western Asia or
      Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camel was early used both for riding and as a beast of
      burden (Gen. 24:64; 37:25), and in war (1 Sam. 30:17; Isa.
      21:7). Mention is made of the camel among the cattle given
      by Pharaoh to Abraham (Gen. 12:16). Its flesh was not to be
      eaten, as it was ranked among unclean animals (Lev. 11:4;
      Deut. 14:7). Abraham&#39;s servant rode on a camel when he
      went to fetch a wife for Isaac (Gen. 24:10, 11). Jacob had
      camels as a portion of his wealth (30:43), as Abraham also
      had (24:35). He sent a present of thirty milch camels to
      his brother Esau (32:15). It appears to have been little in
      use among the Jews after the conquest. It is, however,
      mentioned in the history of David (1 Chr. 27:30), and after
      the Exile (Ezra 2:67; Neh. 7:69). Camels were much in use
      among other nations in the East. The queen of Sheba came
      with a caravan of camels when she came to see the wisdom of
      Solomon (1 Kings 10:2; 2 Chr. 9:1). Benhadad of Damascus
      also sent a present to Elisha, &quot;forty camels&#39;
      burden&quot; (2 Kings 8:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      To show the difficulty in the way of a rich man&#39;s
      entering into the kingdom, our Lord uses the proverbial
      expression that it was easier for a camel to go through the
      eye of a needle (Matt. 19:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      To strain at (rather, out) a gnat and swallow a camel was
      also a proverbial expression (Matt. 23:24), used with
      reference to those who were careful to avoid small faults,
      and yet did not hesitate to commit the greatest sins. The
      Jews carefully filtered their wine before drinking it, for
      fear of swallowing along with it some insect forbidden in
      the law as unclean, and yet they omitted openly the
      &quot;weightier matters&quot; of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raiment worn by John the Baptist was made of
      camel&#39;s hair (Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6), by which he was
      distinguished from those who resided in royal palaces and
      wore soft raiment. This was also the case with Elijah (2
      Kings 1:8), who is called &quot;a hairy man,&quot; from his
      wearing such raiment. &quot;This is one of the most
      admirable materials for clothing; it keeps out the heat,
      cold, and rain.&quot; The &quot;sackcloth&quot; so often
      alluded to (2 Kings 1:8; Isa. 15:3; Zech. 13:4, etc.) was
      probably made of camel&#39;s hair.

      <a name="T0000699"><b>Camon -</b> full of stalks, a place
      (Judg. 10:5) where Jair was buried. It has usually been
      supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of
      Jordan. It is probably, however, the modern Tell-el-Kaimun,
      on the southern slopes of Carmel, the Jokneam of Carmel
      (Josh. 12:22; 1 Kings 4:12), since it is not at all
      unlikely that after he became judge, Jair might find it
      more convenient to live on the west side of Jordan; and
      that he was buried where he had lived. </a>
