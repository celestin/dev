      <a name="T0000700"><b>Camp -</b> During their journeys
      across the wilderness, the twelve tribes formed encampments
      at the different places where they halted (Ex. 16:13; Num.
      2:3). The diagram here given shows the position of the
      different tribes and the form of the encampment during the
      wanderings, according to Num. 1:53; 2:2-31; 3:29, 35, 38;
      10:13-28.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The area of the camp would be in all about 3 square miles.
      After the Hebrews entered Palestine, the camps then spoken
      of were exclusively warlike (Josh. 11:5, 7; Judg. 5:19, 21;
      7:1; 1 Sam. 29:1; 30:9, etc.).
    </p>

      <a name="T0000701"><b>Camphire -</b> (Heb. copher),
      mentioned in Cant. 1:14 (R.V., &quot;henna-flowers&quot;);
      4:13 (R.V., &quot;henna&quot;), is the al-henna of the
      Arabs, a native of Egypt, producing clusters of small white
      and yellow odoriferous flowers, whence is made the Oleum
      Cyprineum. From its leaves is made the peculiar auburn dye
      with which Eastern women stain their nails and the palms of
      their hands. It is found only at Engedi, on the shore of
      the Dead Sea. It is known to botanists by the name Lawsonia
      alba or inermis, a kind of privet, which grows 6 or 8 feet
      high. The margin of the Authorized Version of the passages
      above referred to has &quot;or cypress,&quot; not with
      reference to the conifer so called, but to the circumstance
      that one of the most highly appreciated species of this
      plant grew in the island of Cyprus.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000702"><b>Cana -</b> reedy, a town of Galilee,
      near Capernaum. Here our Lord wrought his first miracle,
      the turning of water into wine (John 2:1-11; 4:46). It is
      also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael (21:2). It
      is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It has been
      identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called
      Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth.
      Others have identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on
      the direct road to the Sea of Galilee, about 5 miles
      north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct course from
      Tiberias. It is called &quot;Cana of Galilee,&quot; to
      distinguish it from Cana of Asher (Josh. 19:28).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000703"><b>Canaan -</b> (1.) The fourth son of
      Ham (Gen. 10:6). His descendants were under a curse in
      consequence of the transgression of his father (9:22-27).
      His eldest son, Zidon, was the father of the Sidonians and
      Phoenicians. He had eleven sons, who were the founders of
      as many tribes (10:15-18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The country which derived its name from the preceding.
      The name as first used by the Phoenicians denoted only the
      maritime plain on which Sidon was built. But in the time of
      Moses and Joshua it denoted the whole country to the west
      of the Jordan and the Dead Sea (Deut. 11:30). In Josh. 5:12
      the LXX. read, &quot;land of the Phoenicians,&quot; instead
      of &quot;land of Canaan.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The name signifies &quot;the lowlands,&quot; as
      distinguished from the land of Gilead on the east of
      Jordan, which was a mountainous district. The extent and
      boundaries of Canaan are fully set forth in different parts
      of Scripture (Gen. 10:19; 17:8; Num. 13:29; 34:8). (See

    <p>
      <a name="T0000704"><b>Canaanite -</b> a name given to the
      apostle Simon (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18). The word here does
      not, however, mean a descendant of Canaan, but is a
      translation, or rather almost a transliteration, of the
      Syriac word Kanenyeh (R.V. rendered &quot;Cananaen&quot;),
      which designates the Jewish sect of the Zealots. Hence he
      is called elsewhere (Luke 6:15) &quot;Simon Zelotes;&quot;
      i.e., Simon of the sect of the Zealots. (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0000705"><b>Canaanites -</b> the descendants of
      Canaan, the son of Ham. Migrating from their original home,
      they seem to have reached the Persian Gulf, and to have
      there sojourned for some time. They thence &quot;spread to
      the west, across the mountain chain of Lebanon to the very
      edge of the Mediterranean Sea, occupying all the land which
      later became Palestine, also to the north-west as far as
      the mountain chain of Taurus. This group was very numerous,
      and broken up into a great many peoples, as we can judge
      from the list of nations (Gen. 10), the &#39;sons of
      Canaan.&#39;&quot; Six different tribes are mentioned in
      Ex. 3:8, 17; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11. In Ex. 13:5 the
      &quot;Perizzites&quot; are omitted. The
      &quot;Girgashites&quot; are mentioned in addition to the
      foregoing in Deut. 7:1; Josh. 3:10.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;Canaanites,&quot; as distinguished from the
      Amalekites, the Anakim, and the Rephaim, were
      &quot;dwellers in the lowlands&quot; (Num. 13:29), the
      great plains and valleys, the richest and most important
      parts of Palestine. Tyre and Sidon, their famous cities,
      were the centres of great commercial activity; and hence
      the name &quot;Canaanite&quot; came to signify a
      &quot;trader&quot; or &quot;merchant&quot; (Job 41:6; Prov.
      31:24, lit. &quot;Canaanites;&quot; comp. Zeph. 1:11; Ezek.
      17:4). The name &quot;Canaanite&quot; is also sometimes
      used to designate the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land
      in general (Gen. 12:6; Num. 21:3; Judg. 1:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Israelites, when they were led to the Promised Land,
      were commanded utterly to destroy the descendants of Canaan
      then possessing it (Ex. 23:23; Num. 33:52, 53; Deut. 20:16,
      17). This was to be done &quot;by little and little,&quot;
      lest the beasts of the field should increase (Ex. 23:29;
      Deut. 7:22, 23). The history of these wars of conquest is
      given in the Book of Joshua. The extermination of these
      tribes, however, was never fully carried out. Jerusalem was
      not taken till the time of David (2 Sam. 5:6, 7). In the
      days of Solomon bond-service was exacted from the fragments
      of the tribes still remaining in the land (1 Kings 9:20,
      21). Even after the return from captivity survivors of five
      of the Canaanitish tribes were still found in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Tell-el-Amarna tablets Canaan is found under the
      forms of Kinakhna and Kinakhkhi. Under the name of Kanana
      the Canaanites appear on Egyptian monuments, wearing a coat
      of mail and helmet, and distinguished by the use of spear
      and javelin and the battle-axe. They were called
      Phoenicians by the Greeks and Poeni by the Romans. By race
      the Canaanites were Semitic. They were famous as merchants
      and seamen, as well as for their artistic skill. The chief
      object of their worship was the sun-god, who was addressed
      by the general name of Baal, &quot;lord.&quot; Each
      locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals
      were summed up under the name of Baalim, &quot;lords.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000706"><b>Canaan, the language of -</b>
      mentioned in Isa. 19:18, denotes the language spoken by the
      Jews resident in Palestine. The language of the Canaanites
      and of the Hebrews was substantially the same. This is seen
      from the fragments of the Phoenician language which still
      survive, which show the closest analogy to the Hebrew. Yet
      the subject of the language of the &quot;Canaanites&quot;
      is very obscure. The cuneiform writing of Babylon, as well
      as the Babylonian language, was taught in the Canaanitish
      schools, and the clay tablets of Babylonian literature were
      stored in the Canaanitish libraries. Even the Babylonian
      divinities were borrowed by the Canaanites.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000707"><b>Candace -</b> the queen of the
      Ethiopians whose &quot;eunuch&quot; or chamberlain was
      converted to Christianity by the instrumentality of Philip
      the evangelist (Acts 8:27). The country which she ruled was
      called by the Greeks Meroe, in Upper Nubia. It was long the
      centre of commercial intercourse between Africa and the
      south of Asia, and hence became famous for its wealth (Isa.
      45:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to
      have prevailed in Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare
      &quot;Pharaoh,&quot; &quot;Ptolemy,&quot;
      &quot;Caesar&quot;) being a title common to several
      successive queens. It is probable that Judaism had taken
      root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of the
      queen&#39;s treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There
      is a tradition that Candace was herself converted to
      Christianity by her treasurer on his return, and that he
      became the apostle of Christianity in that whole region,
      carrying it also into Abyssinia. It is said that he also
      preached the gospel in Arabia Felix and in Ceylon, where he
      suffered martyrdom. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000708"><b>Candle -</b> Heb. ner, Job 18:6;
      29:3; Ps. 18:28; Prov. 24:20, in all which places the
      Revised Version and margin of Authorized Version have
      &quot;lamp,&quot; by which the word is elsewhere frequently
      rendered. The Hebrew word denotes properly any kind of
      candle or lamp or torch. It is used as a figure of
      conscience (Prov. 20:27), of a Christian example (Matt.
      5:14, 15), and of prosperity (Job 21:17; Prov. 13:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000709"><b>Candlestick -</b> the lamp-stand,
      &quot;candelabrum,&quot; which Moses was commanded to make
      for the tabernacle, according to the pattern shown him. Its
      form is described in Ex. 25:31-40; 37:17-24, and may be
      seen represented on the Arch of Titus at Rome. It was among
      the spoils taken by the Romans from the temple of Jerusalem
      (A.D. 70). It was made of fine gold, and with the utensils
      belonging to it was a talent in weight.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tabernacle was a tent without windows, and thus
      artificial light was needed. This was supplied by the
      candlestick, which, however, served also as a symbol of the
      church or people of God, who are &quot;the light of the
      world.&quot; The light which &quot;symbolizes the knowledge
      of God is not the sun or any natural light, but an
      artificial light supplied with a specially prepared oil;
      for the knowledge of God is in truth not natural nor common
      to all men, but furnished over and above nature.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This candlestick was placed on the south side of the Holy
      Place, opposite the table of shewbread (Ex. 27:21; 30:7, 8;
      Lev. 24:3; 1 Sam. 3:3). It was lighted every evening, and
      was extinguished in the morning. In the morning the priests
      trimmed the seven lamps, borne by the seven branches, with
      golden snuffers, carrying away the ashes in golden dishes
      (Ex. 25:38), and supplying the lamps at the same time with
      fresh oil. What ultimately became of the candlestick is
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Solomon&#39;s temple there were ten separate
      candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right and five on
      the left of the Holy Place (1 Kings 7:49; 2 Chr. 4:7).
      Their structure is not mentioned. They were carried away to
      Babylon (Jer. 52:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the temple erected after the Exile there was again but
      one candlestick, and like the first, with seven branches.
      It was this which was afterwards carried away by Titus to
      Rome, where it was deposited in the Temple of Peace. When
      Genseric plundered Rome, he is said to have carried it to
      Carthage (A.D. 455). It was recaptured by Belisarius (A.D.
      533), and carried to Constantinople and thence to
      Jerusalem, where it finally disappeared.

    <p>
      <a name="T0000710"><b>Cane -</b> a tall sedgy plant with a
      hollow stem, growing in moist places. In Isa. 43:24; Jer.
      6:20, the Hebrew word <i>kaneh</i> is thus rendered, giving
      its name to the plant. It is rendered &quot;reed&quot; in 1
      Kings 14:15; Job 40:21; Isa. 19:6; 35:7. In Ps. 68:30 the
      expression &quot;company of spearmen&quot; is in the margin
      and the Revised Version &quot;beasts of the reeds,&quot;
      referring probably to the crocodile or the hippopotamus as
      a symbol of Egypt. In 2 Kings 18:21; Isa. 36:6; Ezek. 29:6,
      7, the reference is to the weak, fragile nature of the
      reed. (See <a href=

      1:4; 2:25). The word is rendered &quot;caterpillar&quot; in
      Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 17 (but R.V.
      &quot;canker-worm&quot;). &quot;It spoileth and fleeth

      <a name="T0000714"><b>Canon -</b> This word is derived from
      a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it
      means something straight, or something to keep straight;
      and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It
      came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they
      contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the
      standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of
      canonical authority when it has a right to take a place
      with the other books which contain a revelation of the
      Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any
      ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the
      inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the
      inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a
      complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice.
      They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to
      men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under
      divine guidance. The different books as they were written
      came into the possession of the Christian associations
      which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost;
      and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were
      gathered together into one collection containing the whole
      of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books.
      Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the
      second century this New Testament collection was
      substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained
      in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its
      place; and thus the whole is of divine authority.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New
      Testament writers. Their evidence is conclusive. The
      quotations in the New from the Old are very numerous, and
      the references are much more numerous. These quotations and
      references by our Lord and the apostles most clearly imply
      the existence at that time of a well-known and publicly
      acknowledged collection of Hebrew writings under the
      designation of &quot;The Scriptures;&quot; &quot;The Law
      and the Prophets and the Psalms;&quot; &quot;Moses and the
      Prophets,&quot; etc. The appeals to these books, moreover,
      show that they were regarded as of divine authority,
      finally deciding all questions of which they treat; and
      that the whole collection so recognized consisted only of
      the thirty-nine books which we now posses. Thus they
      endorse as genuine and authentic the canon of the Jewish
      Scriptures. The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also contained
      every book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures. As
      to the time at which the Old Testament canon was closed,
      there are many considerations which point to that of Ezra
      and Nehemiah, immediately after the return from Babylonian
      exile. (See BIBLE &macr;T0000580, EZRA &macr;T0001294, <a

      <a name="T0000715"><b>Capernaum -</b> Nahum&#39;s town, a
      Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our
      Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our
      Lord&#39;s expulsion from Nazareth (Matt. 4:13-16; Luke
      4:16-31), Capernaum became his &quot;own city.&quot; It was
      the scene of many acts and incidents of his life (Matt.
      8:5, 14, 15; 9:2-6, 10-17; 15:1-20; Mark 1:32-34, etc.).
      The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the
      many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his
      mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of
      judgement (Matt. 11:23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The
      &quot;land of Gennesaret,&quot; near, if not in, which it
      was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded
      districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway
      from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with
      Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan
      flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and
      foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a
      beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been
      the one built by the centurion (Luke 7:5), in which our
      Lord frequently taught (John 6:59; Mark 1:21; Luke 4:33).
      Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to
      be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the
      south on the shore of the lake. &quot;If Tell Hum be
      Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the
      ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and
      one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this
      building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in
      John 6; and it was not without a certain strange feeling
      that on turning over a large block we found the pot of
      manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words,
      &#39;I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in
      the wilderness, and are dead.&#39;&quot;, (The Recovery of
      Jerusalem.)

      seat of the Philistines (Deut. 2:23; Jer. 47:4; Amos 9:7).
      The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of
      Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of
      Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete,
      since the Philistines seem to be meant by the
      &quot;Cherethites&quot; in 1 Sam. 30:14 (see also 2 Sam.
      8:18). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the
      Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the
      same race as the Mizraite people (Gen. 10:14; 1 Chr.
      1:12).</a>

      <a name="T0000717"><b>Cappadocia -</b> the easternmost and
      the largest province of Asia Minor. Christianity very early
      penetrated into this country (1 Pet. 1:1). On the day of
      Pentecost there were Cappadocians at Jerusalem (Acts
      2:9).</a>

      <a name="T0000718"><b>Captain -</b> (1.) Heb. sar (1 Sam.
      22:2; 2 Sam. 23:19). Rendered &quot;chief,&quot; Gen. 40:2;
      41:9; rendered also &quot;prince,&quot; Dan. 1:7;
      &quot;ruler,&quot; Judg. 9:30; &quot;governor,&#39; 1 Kings
      22:26. This same Hebrew word denotes a military captain
      (Ex. 18:21; 2 Kings 1:9; Deut. 1:15; 1 Sam. 18:13, etc.),
      the &quot;captain of the body-guard&quot; (Gen. 37:36;
      39:1; 41:10; Jer. 40:1), or, as the word may be rendered,
      &quot;chief of the executioners&quot; (marg.). The officers
      of the king&#39;s body-guard frequently acted as
      executioners. Nebuzar-adan (Jer. 39:13) and Arioch (Dan.
      2:14) held this office in Babylon.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;captain of the guard&quot; mentioned in Acts
      28:16 was the Praetorian prefect, the commander of the
      Praetorian troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another word (Heb. katsin) so translated denotes
      sometimes a military (Josh. 10:24; Judg. 11:6, 11; Isa.
      22:3 &quot;rulers;&quot; Dan. 11:18) and sometimes a civil
      command, a judge, magistrate, Arab. <i>kady</i>, (Isa.
      1:10; 3:6; Micah 3:1, 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) It is also the rendering of a Hebrew word (shalish)
      meaning &quot;a third man,&quot; or &quot;one of
      three.&quot; The LXX. render in plural by <i>tristatai</i>;
      i.e., &quot;soldiers fighting from chariots,&quot; so
      called because each war-chariot contained three men, one of
      whom acted as charioteer while the other two fought (Ex.
      14:7; 15:4; 1 Kings 9:22; comp. 2 Kings 9:25). This word is
      used also to denote the king&#39;s body-guard (2 Kings
      10:25; 1 Chr. 12:18; 2 Chr. 11:11) or aides-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The &quot;captain of the temple&quot; mentioned in
      Acts 4:1 and 5:24 was not a military officer, but
      superintendent of the guard of priests and Levites who kept
      watch in the temple by night. (Comp. &quot;the ruler of the
      house of God,&quot; 1 Chr. 9:11; 2 Chr. 31:13; Neh. 11:11.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The Captain of our salvation is a name given to our
      Lord (Heb. 2:10), because he is the author and source of
      our salvation, the head of his people, whom he is
      conducting to glory. The &quot;captain of the Lord&#39;s
      host&quot; (Josh. 5:14, 15) is the name given to that
      mysterious person who manifested himself to Abraham (Gen.
      12:7), and to Moses in the bush (Ex. 3:2, 6, etc.) the
      Angel of the covenant. (See <a href=

      Captives were often treated with great cruelty and
      indignity (1 Kings 20:32; Josh. 10:24; Judg. 1:7; 2 Sam.
      4:12; Judg. 8:7; 2 Sam. 12:31; 1 Chr. 20:3). When a city
      was taken by assault, all the men were slain, and the women
      and children carried away captive and sold as slaves (Isa.
      20; 47:3; 2 Chr. 28:9-15; Ps. 44:12; Joel 3:3), and exposed
      to the most cruel treatment (Nah. 3:10; Zech. 14:2; Esther
      3:13; 2 Kings 8:12; Isa. 13:16, 18). Captives were
      sometimes carried away into foreign countries, as was the
      case with the Jews (Jer. 20:5; 39:9, 10; 40:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000720"><b>Captivity -</b> (1.) Of Israel. The
      kingdom of the ten tribes was successively invaded by
      several Assyrian kings. Pul (q.v.) imposed a tribute on
      Menahem of a thousand talents of silver (2 Kings 15:19, 20;
      1 Chr. 5:26) (B.C. 762), and Tiglath-pileser, in the days
      of Pekah (B.C. 738), carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes
      and the inhabitants of Galilee into Assyria (2 Kings 15:29;
      Isa. 9:1). Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid
      siege to Samaria, the capital of the kingdom. During the
      siege he died, and was succeeded by Sargon, who took the
      city, and transported the great mass of the people into
      Assyria (B.C. 721), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and
      in the cities of the Medes (2 Kings 17:3, 5). Samaria was
      never again inhabited by the Israelites. The families thus
      removed were carried to distant cities, many of them not
      far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied by
      colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. (2 Kings 17:24).
      Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten tribes, after a
      separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years (B.C.
      975-721).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many speculations have been indulged in with reference to
      these ten tribes. But we believe that all, except the
      number that probably allied themselves with Judah and
      shared in their restoration under Cyrus, are finally lost.

      river, Like the bubble on the fountain, They are gone, and

    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the
      eighteenth king of Judah (B.C. 605), Nebuchadnezzar having
      overcome the Egyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem
      with a great army. After a brief siege he took that city,
      and carried away the vessels of the sanctuary to Babylon,
      and dedicated them in the Temple of Belus (2 Kings 24:1; 2
      Chr. 36:6, 7; Dan. 1:1, 2). He also carried away the
      treasures of the king, whom he made his vassal. At this
      time, from which is dated the &quot;seventy years&quot; of
      captivity (Jer. 25; Dan. 9:1, 2), Daniel and his companions
      were carried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the
      court and trained in all the learning of the Chaldeans.
      After this, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, a great
      national fast was appointed (Jer. 36:9), during which the
      king, to show his defiance, cut up the leaves of the book
      of Jeremiah&#39;s prophecies as they were read to him in
      his winter palace, and threw them into the fire. In the
      same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings
      24:1), who again a second time (B.C. 598) marched against
      Jerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his son
      Jehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin&#39;s
      counsellors displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third
      time turned his army against Jerusalem, and carried away to
      Babylon a second detachment of Jews as captives, to the
      number of 10,000 (2 Kings 24:13; Jer. 24:1; 2 Chr. 36:10),
      among whom were the king, with his mother and all his
      princes and officers, also Ezekiel, who with many of his
      companions were settled on the banks of the river Chebar
      (q.v.). He also carried away all the remaining treasures of
      the temple and the palace, and the golden vessels of the
      sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mattaniah, the uncle of Jehoiachin, was now made king over
      what remained of the kingdom of Judah, under the name of
      Zedekiah (2 Kings 24:17; 2 Chr. 36:10). After a troubled
      reign of eleven years his kingdom came to an end (2 Chr.
      36:11). Nebuchadnezzar, with a powerful army, besieged
      Jerusalem, and Zedekiah became a prisoner in Babylon. His
      eyes were put out, and he was kept in close confinement
      till his death (2 Kings 25:7). The city was spoiled of all
      that was of value, and then given up to the flames. The
      temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city
      were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all that
      remained of the people, except a number of the poorest
      class who were left to till the ground and dress the
      vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon. This was
      the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land
      was now utterly desolate, and was abondoned to anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C.
      536), Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives,
      and permitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the
      city and the temple (2 Chr. 36:22, 23; Ezra 1; 2). The
      number of the people forming the first caravan, under
      Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 (Ezra 2:64, 65),
      besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A
      considerable number, 12,000 probably, from the ten tribes
      who had been carried away into Assyria no doubt combined
      with this band of liberated captives.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1)
      under Ezra (7:7) (B.C. 458), and (2) Nehemiah (7:66) (B.C.
      445). But the great mass of the people remained still in
      the land to which they had been carried, and became a
      portion of the Jews of the &quot;dispersion&quot; (John
      7:35; 1 Pet. 1:1). The whole number of the exiles that
      chose to remain was probably about six times the number of
      those who returned.

      Hebrew word is from a root meaning &quot;to glitter,&quot;
      &quot;lighten,&quot; &quot;flash.&quot; When held up to the

      glowing coal, and hence is called &quot;carbunculus&quot;,
      i.e., a little coal. It was one of the jewels in the first
      row of the high priest&#39;s breastplate. It has been
      conjectured by some that the garnet is meant. In Isa. 54:12

      confluence of the Chebar and the Euphrates, but a city
      considerably higher up the river, and commanding the
      ordinary passage of the Euphrates; probably identical with
      Hierapolis. It was the capital of the kingdom of the
      northern Hittites. The Babylonian army, under
      Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, here met and
      conquered the army of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt (B.C.
      607). It is mentioned in monuments in B.C. 1600 and down to

      <a name="T0000724"><b>Carmel -</b> a park; generally with
      the article, &quot;the park.&quot; (1.) A prominent
      headland of Central Palestine, consisting of several
      connected hills extending from the plain of Esdraelon to
      the sea, a distance of some 12 miles or more. At the east
      end, in its highest part, it is 1,728 feet high, and at the
      west end it forms a promontory to the bay of Acre about 600
      feet above the sea. It lay within the tribe of Asher. It
      was here, at the east end of the ridge, at a place called
      el-Mukhrakah (i.e., the place of burning), that Elijah
      brought back the people to their allegiance to God, and
      slew the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). Here were consumed
      the &quot;fifties&quot; of the royal guard; and here also
      Elisha received the visit of the bereaved mother whose son
      was restored by him to life (2 Kings 4:25-37). &quot;No
      mountain in or around Palestine retains its ancient beauty
      so much as Carmel. Two or three villages and some scattered
      cottages are found on it; its groves are few but luxuriant;
      it is no place for crags and precipices or rocks of wild
      goats; but its surface is covered with a rich and constant
      verdure.&quot; &quot;The whole mountain-side is dressed
      with blossom, and flowering shrubs, and fragrant
      herbs.&quot; The western extremity of the ridge is,
      however, more rocky and bleak than the eastern. The head of
      the bride in Cant. 7:5 is compared to Carmel. It is ranked
      with Bashan on account of its rich pastures (Isa. 33:9;
      Jer. 50:19; Amos 1:2). The whole ridge is deeply furrowed
      with rocky ravines filled with dense jungle. There are many
      caves in its sides, which at one time were inhabited by
      swarms of monks. These caves are referred to in Amos 9:3.
      To them Elijah and Elisha often resorted (1 Kings 18:19,
      42; 2 Kings 2:25). On its north-west summit there is an
      ancient establishment of Carmelite monks. Vineyards have
      recently been planted on the mount by the German colonists
      of Haifa. The modern Arabic name of the mount is Kurmul,
      but more commonly Jebel Mar Elyas, i.e., Mount St. Elias,
      from the Convent of Elias.</a>

      place of Abigail, who became David&#39;s wife (1 Sam.

      of man&#39;s animal nature are so called (Rom. 15:27; 1
      Cor. 9:11). The ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of
      as &quot;carnal,&quot; because it related to things
      outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the
      purification of the flesh (Heb. 7:16; 9:10). The weapons of
      Christian warfare are &quot;not carnal&quot;, that is, they
      are not of man&#39;s device, nor are wielded by human power
      (2 Cor. 10:4).</a>

      mentioned in 1 Sam. 13:19, 20; Judg. 4:21; Isa. 10:15;

      not this the carpenter?&quot; (Mark 6:3). Every Jew, even
      the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker.
      &quot;In the cities the carpenters would be Greeks, and
      skilled workmen; the carpenter of a provincial village

      or booty. In Isa. 46:1 (R.V., &quot;the things that ye
      carried about&quot;) the word means a load for a beast of
      burden. In 1 Sam. 17:22 and Isa. 10:28 it is the rendering
      of a word (&quot;stuff&quot; in 1 Sam. 10:22) meaning
      implements, equipments, baggage. The phrase in Acts 21:15,

      wheels, and usually drawn by oxen (2 Sam. 6:3). The Hebrew
      word thus rendered, <i>&#39;agalah</i> (1 Sam. 6:7, 8), is
      also rendered &quot;wagon&quot; (Gen. 45:19). It is used
      also to denote a war-chariot (Ps. 46:9). Carts were used
      for the removal of the ark and its sacred utensils (Num.
      7:3, 6). After retaining the ark amongst them for seven
      months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On
      this occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude
      construction, with solid wooden wheels like that still used
      in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows, which
      conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh.</a>

      carving were much practised among the Jews. They were
      practised in connection with the construction of the
      tabernacle and the temple (Ex. 31:2, 5; 35:33; 1 Kings
      6:18, 35; Ps. 74:6), as well as in the ornamentation of the
      priestly dresses (Ex. 28:9-36; Zech. 3:9; 2 Chr. 2:7, 14).
      Isaiah (44:13-17) gives a minute description of the process
      of carving idols of wood.</a>

      <a name="T0000733"><b>Casluhim -</b> fortified, a people
      descended from Mizraim (Gen. 10:14; 1 Chr. 1:12). Their
      original seat was probably somewhere in Lower Egypt, along
      the sea-coast to the south border of Palestine.</a>

      principal spices of the holy anointing oil (Ex. 30:24), and
      an article of commerce (Ezek. 27:19). It is the inner bark
      of a tree resembling the cinnamon (q.v.), the Cinnamomum
      cassia of botanists, and was probably imported from
      India.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Hebrew pl. <i>ketzi&#39;oth</i> (Ps. 45:8). Mentioned
      in connection with myrrh and aloes as being used to scent
      garments. It was probably prepared from the peeled bark, as
      the Hebrew word suggests, of some kind of cinnamon.

      Chr. 11:7), also probably a kind of tower used by the
      priests for making known anything discovered at a distance
      (1 Chr. 6:54). Castles are also mentioned (Gen. 25:16) as a
      kind of watch-tower, from which shepherds kept watch over
      their flocks by night. The &quot;castle&quot; into which
      the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought was the
      quarters of the Roman soldiers in the fortress of Antonia
      (so called by Herod after his patron Mark Antony), which
      was close to the north-west corner of the temple (Acts
      21:34), which it commanded.</a>

      <a name="T0000737"><b>Castor and Pollux -</b> the
      &quot;Dioscuri&quot;, two heroes of Greek and Roman
      mythology. Their figures were probably painted or
      sculptured on the prow of the ship which Luke refers to
      (Acts 28:11). They were regarded as the tutelary divinities
      of sailors. They appeared in the heavens as the
      constellation Gemini.</a>

      in the Old Testament (1 Kings 8:37; 2 Chr. 6:28; Ps. 78:46;
      Isa. 33:4) as the translation of a word (hasil) the root of
      which means &quot;to devour&quot; or &quot;consume,&quot;
      and which is used also with reference to the locust in
      Deut. 28:38. It may have been a species of locust, or the
      name of one of the transformations through which the locust
      passes, locust-grub. It is also found (Ps. 105:34; Jer.
      51:14, 27; R.V., &quot;cankerworm&quot;) as the rendering
      of a different Hebrew word, <i>yelek</i>, a word elsewhere

      or person in particular.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000740"><b>Cattle -</b> abounded in the Holy
      Land. To the rearing and management of them the inhabitants
      chiefly devoted themselves (Deut. 8:13; 12:21; 1 Sam. 11:5;
      12:3; Ps. 144:14; Jer. 3:24). They may be classified
      as,</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Neat cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly
      consumed in sacrifices or used for food. The finest herds
      were found in Bashan, beyond Jordan (Num. 32:4). Large
      herds also pastured on the wide fertile plains of Sharon.
      They were yoked to the plough (1 Kings 19:19), and were
      employed for carrying burdens (1 Chr. 12:40). They were
      driven with a pointed rod (Judg. 3:31) or goad (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed
      for the threshing-floor were not to be muzzled, so as to
      prevent them from eating of the provender over which they
      trampled (Deut. 25:4). Whosoever stole and sold or
      slaughtered an ox must give five in satisfaction (Ex.
      22:1); but if it was found alive in the possession of him
      who stole it, he was required to make double restitution
      only (22:4). If an ox went astray, whoever found it was
      required to bring it back to its owner (23:4; Deut. 22:1,
      4). An ox and an ass could not be yoked together in the
      plough (Deut. 22:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Small cattle. Next to herds of neat cattle, sheep
      formed the most important of the possessions of the
      inhabitants of Palestine (Gen. 12:16; 13:5; 26:14; 21:27;
      29:2, 3). They are frequently mentioned among the booty
      taken in war (Num. 31:32; Josh. 6:21; 1 Sam. 14:32; 15:3).
      There were many who were owners of large flocks (1 Sam.
      25:2; 2 Sam. 12:2, comp. Job 1:3). Kings also had shepherds
      &quot;over their flocks&quot; (1 Chr. 27:31), from which
      they derived a large portion of their revenue (2 Sam.
      17:29; 1 Chr. 12:40). The districts most famous for their
      flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon (Isa. 65: 10),
      Mount Carmel (Micah 7:14), Bashan and Gilead (Micah 7:14).
      In patriarchal times the flocks of sheep were sometimes
      tended by the daughters of the owners. Thus Rachel, the
      daughter of Laban, kept her father&#39;s sheep (Gen. 29:9);
      as also Zipporah and her six sisters had charge of their
      father Jethro&#39;s flocks (Ex. 2:16). Sometimes they were
      kept by hired shepherds (John 10:12), and sometimes by the
      sons of the family (1 Sam. 16:11; 17:15). The keepers so
      familiarized their sheep with their voices that they knew
      them, and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more
      especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in
      sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive
      occasion (1 Sam. 25:4; 2 Sam. 13:23). They were folded at
      night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks of
      the lion (Micah 5:8), the bear (1 Sam. 17:34), and the wolf
      (Matt. 10:16; John 10:12). They were liable to wander over
      the wide pastures and go astray (Ps. 119:176; Isa. 53:6;
      Hos. 4:16; Matt. 18:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Goats also formed a part of the pastoral wealth of
      Palestine (Gen. 15:9; 32:14; 37:31). They were used both
      for sacrifice and for food (Deut. 14:4), especially the
      young males (Gen. 27:9, 14, 17; Judg. 6:19; 13:15; 1 Sam.
      16:20). Goat&#39;s hair was used for making tent cloth (Ex.
      26:7; 36:14), and for mattresses and bedding (1 Sam. 19:13,
      16). (See <a href=

      i.e., &quot;something redundant&quot;), the membrane which
      covers the upper part of the liver (Ex. 29:13, 22; Lev.
      3:4, 10, 15; 4:9; 7:4; marg., &quot;midriff&quot;). In Hos.
      13:8 (Heb. seghor; i.e., &quot;an enclosure&quot;) the

      <a name="T0000742"><b>Cauls -</b> In Isa. 3:18 this word
      (Heb. shebisim), in the marg. &quot;networks,&quot; denotes
      network caps to contain the hair, worn by females. Others

      translated &quot;terrace.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0000744"><b>Cave -</b> There are numerous natural
      caves among the limestone rocks of Syria, many of which
      have been artificially enlarged for various purposes.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first notice of a cave occurs in the history of Lot
      (Gen. 19:30).
    </p>
    <p>
      The next we read of is the cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which
      Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth (Gen. 25:9, 10). It
      was the burying-place of Sarah and of Abraham himself, also
      of Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob (Gen. 49:31; 50:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave of Makkedah, into which the five Amorite kings
      retired after their defeat by Joshua (10:16, 27).
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave of Adullam (q.v.), an immense natural cavern,
      where David hid himself from Saul (1 Sam. 22:1, 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called &#39;Ain Jidy, i.e.,
      the &quot;Fountain of the Kid&quot;, where David cut off
      the skirt of Saul&#39;s robe (24:4). Here he also found a
      shelter for himself and his followers to the number of 600
      (23:29; 24:1). &quot;On all sides the country is full of
      caverns which might serve as lurking-places for David and
      his men, as they do for outlaws at the present day.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets (1 Kings 18:4)
      was probably in the north, but it cannot be identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave of Elijah (1 Kings 19:9), and the
      &quot;cleft&quot; of Moses on Horeb (Ex. 33:22), cannot be
      determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Gideon the Israelites took refuge from the
      Midianites in dens and caves, such as abounded in the
      mountain regions of Manasseh (Judg. 6:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Caves were frequently used as dwelling-places (Num. 24:21;
      Cant. 2:14; Jer. 49:16; Obad. 1:3). &quot;The excavations
      at Deir Dubban, on the south side of the wady leading to
      Santa Hanneh, are probably the dwellings of the
      Horites,&quot; the ancient inhabitants of Idumea Proper.
      The pits or cavities in rocks were also sometimes used as
      prisons (Isa. 24:22; 51:14; Zech. 9:11). Those which had
      niches in their sides were occupied as burying-places
      (Ezek. 32:23; John 11:38).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000745"><b>Cedar -</b> (Heb. e&#39;rez, Gr.
      kedros, Lat. cedrus), a tree very frequently mentioned in
      Scripture. It was stately (Ezek. 31:3-5), long-branched
      (Ps. 80:10; 92:12; Ezek. 31:6-9), odoriferous (Cant. 4:11;
      Hos. 14:6), durable, and therefore much used for boards,
      pillars, and ceilings (1 Kings 6:9, 10; 7:2; Jer. 22:14),
      for masts (Ezek. 27:5), and for carved images (Isa.
      44:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew very abundantly in Palestine, and particularly on
      Lebanon, of which it was &quot;the glory&quot; (Isa. 35:2;
      60:13). Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar trees from
      Lebanon for various purposes connected with the
      construction of the temple and the king&#39;s palace (2
      Sam. 5:11; 7:2, 7; 1 Kings 5:6, 8,10; 6:9, 10, 15, 16, 18,
      20; 7:2, 3, 7, 11, 12; 9:11, etc.). Cedars were used also
      in the building of the second temple under Zerubbabel (Ezra
      3:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the ancient cedars of Lebanon there remain now only some
      seven or eight. They are not standing together. But beside
      them there are found between three hundred and four hundred
      of younger growth. They stand in an amphitheatre fronting
      the west, about 6,400 feet above the level of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cedar is often figuratively alluded to in the sacred
      Scriptures. &quot;The mighty conquerors of olden days, the
      despots of Assyria and the Pharaohs of Egypt, the proud and
      idolatrous monarchs of Judah, the Hebrew commonwealth
      itself, the war-like Ammonites of patriarchal times, and
      the moral majesty of the Messianic age, are all compared to
      the towering cedar, in its royal loftiness and supremacy
      (Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 17:3, 22, 23, 31:3-9; Amos 2:9; Zech.
      11:1, 2; Job 40:17; Ps. 29:5; 80:10; 92:12, etc).&quot;,

      of the Mediterranean. When Paul returned from his second
      missionary journey to Syria, he sailed from this port (Acts
      18:18). In Rom. 16:1 he speaks as if there were at the time
      of his writing that epistle an organized church there. The
      western harbour of Corinth was Lechaeum, about a mile and a
      half from the city. It was the channel of its trade with
      Italy and the west.</a>

      filled the censer with live coal from the sacred fire on
      the altar of burnt-offering, and having carried it into the
      sanctuary, there threw upon the burning coals the sweet
      incense (Lev. 16:12, 13), which sent up a cloud of smoke,
      filling the apartment with fragrance. The censers in daily
      use were of brass (Num. 16:39), and were designated by a
      different Hebrew name, <i>miktereth</i> (2 Chr. 26:19;
      Ezek. 8:11): while those used on the day of Atonement were
      of gold, and were denoted by a word (mahtah) meaning
      &quot;something to take fire with;&quot; LXX. pureion = a
      fire-pan. Solomon prepared for the temple censers of pure
      gold (1 Kings 7:50; 2 Chr. 4:22). The angel in the
      Apocalypse is represented with a golden censer (Rev. 8:3,
      5). Paul speaks of the golden censer as belonging to the
      tabernacle (Heb. 9:4). The Greek word thumiaterion, here
      rendered &quot;censer,&quot; may more appropriately denote,
      as in the margin of Revised Version, &quot;the altar of
      incense.&quot; Paul does not here say that the thumiaterion
      was in the holiest, for it was in the holy place, but that
      the holiest had it, i.e., that it belonged to the holiest
      (1 Kings 6:22). It was intimately connected with the high
      priest&#39;s service in the holiest.</a>

      and upward was then 603,550 (Ex. 38:26). (2.) Another
      census was made just before the entrance into Canaan, when
      the number was found to be 601,730, showing thus a small
      decrease (Num. 26:51). (3.) The next census was in the time
      of David, when the number, exclusive of the tribes of Levi
      and Benjamin, was found to be 1,300,000 (2 Sam. 24:9; 1
      Chr. 21:5). (4.) Solomon made a census of the foreigners in
      the land, and found 153,600 able-bodied workmen (2 Chr.
      2:17, 18). (5.) After the return from Exile the whole
      congregation of Israel was numbered, and found to amount to
      42,360 (Ezra 2:64). A census was made by the Roman
      government in the time of our Lord (Luke 2:1). (See <a

      11, 31, 43; 28:16. A centurion watched the crucifixion of
      our Lord (Matt. 27:54; Luke 23:47), and when he saw the
      wonders attending it, exclaimed, &quot;Truly this man was
      the Son of God.&quot; &quot;The centurions mentioned in the
      New Testament are uniformly spoken of in terms of praise,
      whether in the Gospels or in the Acts. It is interesting to
      compare this with the statement of Polybius (vi. 24), that
      the centurions were chosen by merit, and so were men
      remarkable not so much for their daring courage as for
      their deliberation, constancy, and strength of mind.&quot;,

      3:12). This word sometimes, however, means dried grass or
      hay (Isa. 5:24; 33:11). Chaff is used as a figure of
      abortive wickedness (Ps. 1:4; Matt. 3:12). False doctrines
      are also called chaff (Jer. 23:28), or more correctly
      rendered &quot;chopped straw.&quot; The destruction of the
      wicked, and their powerlessness, are likened to the

      (Acts 28:20; Eph. 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:16). Sometimes, for the

      Babylonia, Lower Mesopotamia, lying chiefly on the right
      bank of the Euphrates, but commonly used of the whole of
      the Mesopotamian plain. The Hebrew name is Kasdim, which is
      usually rendered &quot;Chaldeans&quot; (Jer. 50:10;
      51:24,35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits
      of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400
      miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles
      in average breadth. &quot;In former days the vast plains of
      Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals
      and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the
      country like a network. The wants of a teeming population
      were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that
      on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from
      a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of
      palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or
      traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of
      passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the
      busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine.&quot;

    <p>
      Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have
      thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs,
      and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in
      many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was,
      we are told, born at &quot;Ur of the Chaldees.&quot;
      &quot;Chaldees&quot; is a mistranslation of the Hebrew <i>
      Kasdim</i>, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the
      Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on
      the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part
      of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur
      was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian
      cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the
      western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About
      a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a
      powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam
      on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were
      followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon,
      and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The
      founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (&quot;Shem is my
      father&quot;). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under
      Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to
      acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to
      that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at
      Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the
      river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku,
      the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been
      recognized, is the Biblical &quot;Arioch king of
      Ellasar&quot; (Gen. 14:1). The contemporaneous king of
      Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in
      Scripture, was Khammu-rabi. (See BABYLON &macr;T0000409;

      the sacred writers in certain portions of the Old
      Testament, viz., Dan. 2:4-7, 28; Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26;
      Gen. 31:46; Jer. 10:11. It is the Aramaic dialect, as it is
      sometimes called, as distinguished from the Hebrew dialect.
      It was the language of commerce and of social intercourse
      in Western Asia, and after the Exile gradually came to be
      the popular language of Palestine. It is called
      &quot;Syrian&quot; in 2 Kings 18:26. Some isolated words in
      this language are preserved in the New Testament (Matt.
      5:22; 6:24; 16:17; 27:46; Mark 3:17; 5:41; 7:34; 14:36;
      Acts 1:19; 1 Cor. 16:22). These are specimens of the
      vernacular language of Palestine at that period. The term
      &quot;Hebrew&quot; was also sometimes applied to the
      Chaldee because it had become the language of the Hebrews
      (John 5:2; 19:20).</a>

      <a name="T0000760"><b>Chaldees -</b> or Chaldeans, the
      inhabitants of the country of which Babylon was the
      capital. They were so called till the time of the Captivity
      (2 Kings 25; Isa. 13:19; 23:13), when, particularly in the
      Book of Daniel (5:30; 9:1), the name began to be used with
      special reference to a class of learned men ranked with the
      magicians and astronomers. These men cultivated the ancient
      Cushite language of the original inhabitants of the land,
      for they had a &quot;learning&quot; and a
      &quot;tongue&quot; (1:4) of their own. The common language
      of the country at that time had become assimilated to the
      Semitic dialect, especially through the influence of the
      Assyrians, and was the language that was used for all civil
      purposes. The Chaldeans were the learned class, interesting
      themselves in science and religion, which consisted, like
      that of the ancient Arabians and Syrians, in the worship of
      the heavenly bodies. There are representations of this
      priestly class, of magi and diviners, on the walls of the
      Assyrian palaces.</a>

      through the hall toward the street. This was the
      &quot;guest chamber&quot; where entertainments were
      prepared (Mark 14:14). There were also &quot;chambers
      within chambers&quot; (1 Kings 22:25; 2 Kings 9:2). To
      enter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer and
      communion with God (Isa. 26:20). The &quot;chambers of the
      south&quot; (Job 9:9) are probably the constelations of the
      southern hemisphere. The &quot;chambers of imagery&quot;,
      i.e., chambers painted with images, as used by Ezekiel
      (8:12), is an expression denoting the vision the prophet
      had of the abominations practised by the Jews in

      mention is made of &quot;Erastus the chamberlain.&quot;
      Here the word denotes the treasurer of the city, or the
      quaestor, as the Romans styled him. He is almost the only
      convert from the higher ranks of whom mention is made
      (comp. Acts 17:34). Blastus, Herod&#39;s
      &quot;chamberlain&quot; (Acts 12:20), was his personal
      attendant or valet-de-chambre. The Hebrew word <i>
      saris</i>, thus translated in Esther 1:10, 15; 2:3, 14, 21,

      &quot;land crocodile&quot;). In the same verse the Hebrew
      <i>tanshemeth</i>, rendered in Authorized Version
      &quot;mole,&quot; is in Revised Version
      &quot;chameleon,&quot; which is the correct rendering. This

      tragelephus), which is still found in Sinai and in the
      broken ridges of Stony Arabia. The LXX. and Vulgate render
      the word by camelopardus, i.e., the giraffe; but this is an

      of this kind at the head of armies were common in ancient

      that time, but by a specific arrangement and in exact
      fulfilment of a plan; not the plan of the priest, nor the
      plan of the wounded traveller, but the plan of God. By
      coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is,
      by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were
      previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In
      the result they fell together according to the omniscient
      Designer&#39;s plan. This is the true theory of the divine
      government.&quot; Compare the meeting of Philip with the
      Ethiopian (Acts 8:26, 27). There is no &quot;chance&quot;
      in God&#39;s empire. &quot;Chance&quot; is only another

      <a name="T0000773"><b>Chapter -</b> The several books of
      the Old and New Testaments were from an early time divided
      into chapters. The Pentateuch was divided by the ancient
      Hebrews into 54 <i>parshioth</i> or sections, one of which
      was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day (Acts. 13:15).
      These sections were afterwards divided into 669 <i>
      sidrim</i> or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were
      divided in somewhat the same manner into <i>haphtaroth</i>
      or passages.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early Latin and Greek versions of the Bible, similar
      divisions of the several books were made. The New Testament
      books were also divided into portions of various lengths
      under different names, such as titles and heads or
      chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times this ancient example was imitated, and many
      attempts of the kind were made before the existing division
      into chapters was fixed. The Latin Bible published by
      Cardinal Hugo of St. Cher in A.D. 1240 is generally
      regarded as the first Bible that was divided into our
      present chapters, although it appears that some of the
      chapters were fixed as early as A.D. 1059. This division
      into chapters came gradually to be adopted in the published
      editions of the Hebrew, with some few variations, and of
      the Greek Scriptures, and hence of other versions.

      The silver vessels given by the heads of the tribes for the

      The &quot;charger&quot; in which the Baptist&#39;s head was
      presented was a platter or flat wooden trencher (Matt.
      14:8, 11; Mark 6:25, 28). The chargers of gold and silver

    </p>
    <p>
      The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a mark
      of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh&#39;s second state
      chariot (Gen. 41:43); and the next, when he went out in his
      own chariot to meet his father Jacob (46:29). Chariots
      formed part of the funeral procession of Jacob (50:9). When
      Pharaoh pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots
      with him (Ex. 14:7). The Canaanites in the valleys of
      Palestine had chariots of iron (Josh. 17:18; Judg. 1:19).
      Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots (Judg. 4:3);
      and in Saul&#39;s time the Philistines had 30,000. In his
      wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David
      took many chariots among the spoils (2 Sam. 8:4; 10:18).
      Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots (1
      Kings 10:26), which were chiefly imported from Egypt (29).
      From this time forward they formed part of the armies of
      Israel (1 Kings 22:34; 2 Kings 9:16, 21; 13:7, 14; 18:24;
      23:30).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament we have only one historical reference
      to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch
      (Acts. 8:28, 29, 38).
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts (Ps.
      68:17; 2 Kings 6:17). Elijah, by his prayers and his
      counsel, was &quot;the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
      thereof.&quot; The rapid agency of God in the phenomena of
      nature is also spoken of under the similitude of a chariot
      (Ps. 104:3; Isa. 66:15; Hab. 3:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chariot of the cherubim (1 Chr. 28:18), the chariot formed
      by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord
      rides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots
      in time of peace (2 Chr. 1:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chariot horses were such as were peculiarly fitted for
      service in chariots (2 Kings 7:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chariots of war are described in Ex. 14:7; 1 Sam. 13:5; 2
      Sam. 8:4; 1 Chr. 18:4; Josh. 11:4; Judg. 4:3, 13. They were
      not used by the Israelites till the time of David. Elijah
      was translated in a &quot;chariot of fire&quot; (2 Kings
      2:11). Comp. 2 Kings 6:17. This vision would be to Elisha a
      source of strength and encouragement, for now he could say,
      &quot;They that be with us are more than they that be with
      them.&quot;

      <a name="T0000777"><b>Charity -</b> (1 Cor. 13), the
      rendering in the Authorized Version of the word which
      properly denotes love, and is frequently so rendered
      (always so in the Revised Version). It is spoken of as the
      greatest of the three Christian graces (1 Cor.
      12:31-13:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000778"><b>Charmer -</b> one who practises
      serpent-charming (Ps. 58:5; Jer. 8:17; Eccl. 10:11). It was
      an early and universal opinion that the most venomous
      reptiles could be made harmless by certain charms or by
      sweet sounds. It is well known that there are jugglers in
      India and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at
      the present day.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Isa. 19:3 the word &quot;charmers&quot; is the rendering
      of the Hebrew <i>&#39;ittim</i>, meaning, properly,
      necromancers (R.V. marg., &quot;whisperers&quot;). In Deut.
      18:11 the word &quot;charmer&quot; means a dealer in
      spells, especially one who, by binding certain knots, was
      supposed thereby to bind a curse or a blessing on its
      object. In Isa. 3:3 the words &quot;eloquent orator&quot;
      should be, as in the Revised Version, &quot;skilful
      enchanter.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000779"><b>Charran -</b> another form (Acts 7:2,
      4) of Haran (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000780"><b>Chebar -</b> length, a river in the
      &quot;land of the Chaldeans&quot; (Ezek. 1:3), on the banks
      of which were located some of the Jews of the Captivity
      (Ezek. 1:1; 3:15, 23; 10:15, 20, 22). It has been supposed
      to be identical with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or
      modern Khabour, which falls into the Euphrates at
      Circesium. To the banks of this river some of the
      Israelites were removed by the Assyrians (2 Kings 17:6). An
      opinion that has much to support it is that the
      &quot;Chebar&quot; was the royal canal of Nebuchadnezzar,
      the Nahr Malcha, the greatest in Mesopotamia, which
      connected the Tigris with the Euphrates, in the excavation
      of which the Jewish captives were probably employed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000781"><b>Chedorlaomer -</b> (= Khudur-Lagamar
      of the inscriptions), king of Elam. Many centuries before
      the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula
      had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of
      Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which
      claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of
      the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at
      once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the
      dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one
      rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the
      throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the
      Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of
      Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the
      Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku (&quot;the
      servant of the moon-god&quot;), the son of an Elamite
      prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled &quot;the father of
      the land of the Amorites.&quot; A recently discovered
      tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi,
      Kudur-Lagamar (&quot;the servant of the goddess
      Lagamar&quot;) or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and
      Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi, whose name is also read
      Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars, succeeded in
      overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of
      Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian
      conquerors, mentions in two inscriptions that he took Susa
      1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta, king of Elam, had
      conquered Babylonia. It was in the year B.C. 660 that
      Assur-bani-pal took Susa.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000782"><b>Cheek -</b> Smiting on the cheek was
      accounted a grievous injury and insult (Job 16:10; Lam.
      3:30; Micah 5:1). The admonition (Luke 6:29), &quot;Unto
      him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
      other,&quot; means simply, &quot;Resist not evil&quot;
      (Matt. 5:39; 1 Pet. 2:19-23). Ps. 3:7 = that God had
      deprived his enemies of the power of doing him injury.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000783"><b>Cheese -</b> (A.S. cese). This word
      occurs three times in the Authorized Version as the
      translation of three different Hebrew words: (1.) 1 Sam.
      17:18, &quot;ten cheeses;&quot; i.e., ten sections of curd.
      (2.) 2 Sam. 17:29, &quot;cheese of kine&quot; = perhaps
      curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version reads &quot;fat
      calves.&quot; (3.) Job 10:10, curdled milk is meant by the
      word.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000784"><b>Chemarim -</b> black, (Zeph. 1:4;
      rendered &quot;idolatrous priests&quot; in 2 Kings 23:5,
      and &quot;priests&quot; in Hos. 10:5). Some derive this
      word from the Assyrian Kamaru, meaning &quot;to throw
      down,&quot; and interpret it as describing the idolatrous
      priests who prostrate themselves before the idols. Others
      regard it as meaning &quot;those who go about in
      black,&quot; or &quot;ascetics.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000785"><b>Chemosh -</b> the destroyer, subduer,
      or fish-god, the god of the Moabites (Num. 21:29; Jer.
      48:7, 13, 46). The worship of this god, &quot;the
      abomination of Moab,&quot; was introduced at Jerusalem by
      Solomon (1 Kings 11:7), but was abolished by Josiah (2
      Kings 23:13). On the &quot;Moabite Stone&quot; (q.v.),
      Mesha (2 Kings 3:5) ascribes his victories over the king of
      Israel to this god, &quot;And Chemosh drove him before my
      sight.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000786"><b>Chenaanah -</b> merchant. (1.) A
      Benjamite (1 Chr. 7:10). (2.) The father of Zedekiah (1
      Kings 22:11, 24).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000787"><b>Chenaiah -</b> whom Jehovah hath
      made. &quot;Chief of the Levites,&quot; probably a
      Kohathite (1 Chr. 15:22), and therefore not the same as
      mentioned in 26:29.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000788"><b>Chephirah -</b> village, one of the
      four cities of the Gibeonitish Hivites with whom Joshua
      made a league (9:17). It belonged to Benjamin. It has been
      identified with the modern Kefireh, on the west confines of
      Benjamin, about 2 miles west of Ajalon and 11 from
      Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000789"><b>Cherethim -</b> (Ezek. 25:16), more
      frequently Cherethites, the inhabitants of Southern
      Philistia, the Philistines (Zeph. 2:5). The Cherethites and
      the Pelethites were David&#39;s life-guards (1 Sam. 30:14;
      2 Sam. 8:18; 20:7, 23; 23:23). This name is by some
      interpreted as meaning &quot;Cretans,&quot; and by others
      &quot;executioners,&quot; who were ready to execute the
      king&#39;s sentence of death (Gen. 37:36, marg.; 1 Kings
      2:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000790"><b>Cherith -</b> a cutting; separation;
      a gorge, a torrent-bed or winter-stream, a
      &quot;brook,&quot; in whose banks the prophet Elijah hid
      himself during the early part of the three years&#39;
      drought (1 Kings 17:3, 5). It has by some been identified
      as the Wady el-Kelt behind Jericho, which is formed by the
      junction of many streams flowing from the mountains west of
      Jericho. It is dry in summer. Travellers have described it
      as one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and
      peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the
      persecuted. But if the prophet&#39;s interview with Ahab
      was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it
      is probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some
      of the ravines of Gilead. The &quot;brook&quot; is said to
      have been &quot;before Jordan,&quot; which probably means
      that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed.
      This description would apply to the east as well as to the
      west of Jordan. Thus Elijah&#39;s hiding-place may have
      been the Jermuk, in the territory of the half-tribe of
      Manasseh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000791"><b>Cherub -</b> plural cherubim, the
      name of certain symbolical figures frequently mentioned in
      Scripture. They are first mentioned in connection with the
      expulsion of our first parents from Eden (Gen. 3:24). There
      is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are
      next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide
      furniture for the tabernacle (Ex. 25:17-20; 26:1, 31). God
      promised to commune with Moses &quot;from between the
      cherubim&quot; (25:22). This expression was afterwards used
      to denote the Divine abode and presence (Num. 7:89; 1 Sam.
      4:4; Isa. 37:16; Ps. 80:1; 99:1). In Ezekiel&#39;s vision
      (10:1-20) they appear as living creatures supporting the
      throne of God. From Ezekiel&#39;s description of them
      (1;10; 41:18, 19), they appear to have been compound
      figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial
      images possessing the features and properties of several
      animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the
      ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon&#39;s
      temple. Ezekiel (1:4-14) speaks of four; and this number of
      &quot;living creatures&quot; is mentioned in Rev. 4:6.
      Those on the ark are called the &quot;cherubim of
      glory&quot; (Heb. 9:5), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of
      glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They
      were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings
      stretched upward, and their faces &quot;toward each other
      and toward the mercy-seat.&quot; They were anointed with
      holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred
      furniture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to
      represent spiritual existences in immediate contact with
      Jehovah. Some have regarded them as symbolical of the chief
      ruling power by which God carries on his operations in
      providence (Ps. 18:10). Others interpret them as having
      reference to the redemption of men, and as symbolizing the
      great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other
      opinions have been held regarding them which need not be
      referred to here. On the whole, it seems to be most
      satisfactory to regard the interpretation of the symbol to
      be variable, as is the symbol itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their office was, (1) on the expulsion of our first parents
      from Eden, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and
      (2) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in his
      manifestation of himself on earth. He dwelleth between and
      sitteth on the cherubim (1 Sam. 4:4; Ps. 80:1; Ezek. 1:26,
      28).

      a place on the border of Judah, on the side of Mount Jearim
      (Josh. 15:10); probably identified with the modern village
      of Kesla, on the western mountains of Judah.</a>
    </p>

      south of Judah (Josh. 15:30); probably the same as Bethul
      (19:4) and Bethuel (1 Chr. 4:30); now Khelasa.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000795"><b>Chest -</b> (Heb. <i>&#39;aron</i>,
      generally rendered &quot;ark&quot;), the coffer into which
      the contributions for the repair of the temple were put (2
      Kings 12:9, 10; 2 Chr. 24:8, 10, 11). In Gen. 50:26 it is
      rendered &quot;coffin.&quot; In Ezek. 27:24 a different
      Hebrew word, <i>genazim</i> (plur.), is used. It there
      means &quot;treasure-chests.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000796"><b>Chestnut tree -</b> (Heb. <i>

      connection with Jacob&#39;s artifice regarding the cattle
      (Gen. 30:37). It is one of the trees of which, because of
      its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened
      (Ezek. 31:8; R.V., &quot;plane trees&quot;). It is probably
      the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is
      intended. It is a characteristic of this tree that it
      annually sheds its outer bark, becomes &quot;naked.&quot;
      The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine.</a>

      between Jezreel and Shunem (Josh. 19:18). It has been
      identified with Chisloth-tabor, 2 1/2 miles to the west of
      Mount Tabor, and north of Jezreel; now Iksal.</a>

      threshing-floor at which the death of Uzzah took place (1
      Chr. 13:9). In the parallel passage in Samuel (2 Sam. 6:6)
      it is called &quot;Nachon&#39;s threshing-floor.&quot; It
      was a place not far north-west from Jerusalem. </a>
