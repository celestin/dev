      <a name="T0000802"><b>Chiefs of Asia -</b>
      &quot;Asiarchs,&quot; the title given to certain wealthy
      persons annually appointed to preside over the religious
      festivals and games in the various cities of proconsular
      Asia (Acts 19:31). Some of these officials appear to have
      been Paul&#39;s friends.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000803"><b>Child -</b> This word has
      considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph
      is called a child at the time when he was probably about
      sixteen years of age (Gen. 37:3); and Benjamin is so called
      when he was above thirty years (44:20). Solomon called
      himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (1 Kings
      3:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his
      children; as, &quot;the children of Edom,&quot; &quot;the
      children of Moab,&quot; &quot;the children of Israel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children
      till they were from thirty months to three years old; and
      the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival
      day (Gen. 21:8; Ex. 2:7, 9; 1 Sam. 1:22-24; Matt. 21:16).
      At the age of five, children began to learn the arts and
      duties of life under the care of their fathers (Deut.
      6:20-25; 11:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine
      favour (Gen. 11:30; 30:1; 1 Sam. 2:5; 2 Sam. 6:23; Ps.
      127:3; 128:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or
      narrow-minded (Matt. 11:16; Luke 7:32; 1 Cor. 13:11).
      &quot;When I was a child, I spake as a child.&quot;
      &quot;Brethren, be not children in understanding&quot; (1
      Cor. 14:20). &quot;That we henceforth be no more children,
      tossed to and fro&quot; (Eph. 4:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and
      humility (Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17).
      Believers are &quot;children of light&quot; (Luke 16:8; 1
      Thess. 5:5) and &quot;children of obedience&quot; (1 Pet.
      1:14).

      <a name="T0000804"><b>Chileab -</b> protected by the
      father, David&#39;s second son by Abigail (2 Sam. 3:3);
      called also Daniel (1 Chr. 3:1). He seems to have died when
      young.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000805"><b>Chilion -</b> the pining one, the
      younger son of Elimelech and Naomi, and husband of Orpah,
      Ruth&#39;s sister (Ruth 1:2; 4:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000806"><b>Chilmad -</b> a place or country
      unknown which, along with Sheba and Asshur, traded with
      Tyre (Ezek. 27:23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000807"><b>Chimham -</b> pining, probably the
      youngest son of Barzillai the Gileadite (2 Sam. 19:37-40).
      The &quot;habitation of Chimham&quot; (Jer. 41:17) was
      probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the
      Hebrew <i>geruth</i>, rendered &quot;habitation&quot;,
      established in later times in his possession at Bethlehem,
      which David gave to him as a reward for his loyalty in
      accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom
      (1 Kings 2:7). It has been supposed that, considering the
      stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in the
      stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was
      born (Luke 2:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000808"><b>Chinnereth -</b> lyre, the singular
      form of the word (Deut. 3:17; Josh. 19:35), which is also
      used in the plural form, Chinneroth, the name of a fenced
      city which stood near the shore of the lake of Galilee, a
      little to the south of Tiberias. The town seems to have
      given its name to a district, as appears from 1 Kings
      15:20, where the plural form of the word is used.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sea of Chinnereth (Num. 34:11; Josh. 13:27), or of
      Chinneroth (Josh. 12: 3), was the &quot;lake of
      Gennesaret&quot; or &quot;sea of Tiberias&quot; (Deut.
      3:17; Josh. 11:2). Chinnereth was probably an ancient
      Canaanitish name adopted by the Israelites into their
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000809"><b>Chios -</b> mentioned in Acts 20:15,
      an island in the Aegean Sea, about 5 miles distant from the
      mainland, having a roadstead, in the shelter of which Paul
      and his companions anchored for a night when on his third
      missionary return journey. It is now called Scio.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000810"><b>Chisleu -</b> the name adopted from
      the Babylonians by the Jews after the Captivity for the
      third civil, or ninth ecclesiastical, month (Neh. 1:1;
      Zech. 7:1). It corresponds nearly with the moon in
      November.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000811"><b>Chittim -</b> or Kittim, a plural
      form (Gen. 10:4), the name of a branch of the descendants
      of Javan, the &quot;son&quot; of Japheth. Balaam foretold
      (Num. 24:24) &quot;that ships shall come from the coast of
      Chittim, and afflict Eber.&quot; Daniel prophesied (11:30)
      that the ships of Chittim would come against the king of
      the north. It probably denotes Cyprus, whose ancient
      capital was called Kition by the Greeks.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The references elsewhere made to Chittim (Isa. 23:1, 12;
      Jer. 2:10; Ezek. 27:6) are to be explained on the ground
      that while the name originally designated the Phoenicians
      only, it came latterly to be used of all the islands and
      various settlements on the sea-coasts which they had
      occupied, and then of the people who succeeded them when
      the Phoenician power decayed. Hence it designates generally
      the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean and the races
      that inhabit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000812"><b>Chiun -</b> occurs only in Amos 5:26
      (R.V. marg., &quot;shrine&quot;). The LXX. translated the
      word by Rhephan, which became corrupted into Remphan, as
      used by Stephen (Acts 7:43; but R.V., &quot;Rephan&quot;).
      Probably the planet Saturn is intended by the name.
      Astrologers represented this planet as baleful in its
      influences, and hence the Phoenicians offered to it human
      sacrifices, especially children.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000813"><b>Chloe -</b> verdure, a female
      Christian (1 Cor. 1:11), some of whose household had
      informed Paul of the divided state of the Corinthian
      church. Nothing is known of her.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000814"><b>Chor-ashan -</b> smoking furnace, one
      of the places where &quot;David himself and his men were
      wont to haunt&quot; (1 Sam. 30:30, 31). It is probably
      identical with Ashan (Josh. 15:42; 19:7), a Simeonite city
      in the Negeb, i.e., the south, belonging to Judah. The word
      ought, according to another reading, to be
      &quot;Bor-ashan.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000815"><b>Chorazin -</b> named along with
      Bethsaida and Capernaum as one of the cities in which our
      Lord&#39;s &quot;mighty works&quot; were done, and which
      was doomed to woe because of signal privileges neglected
      (Matt. 11:21; Luke 10:13). It has been identified by
      general consent with the modern Kerazeh, about 2 1/2 miles
      up the Wady Kerazeh from Capernaum; i.e., Tell Hum.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000816"><b>Chosen -</b> spoken of warriors (Ex.
      15:4; Judg. 20:16), of the Hebrew nation (Ps. 105:43; Deut.
      7:7), of Jerusalem as the seat of the temple (1 Kings
      11:13). Christ is the &quot;chosen&quot; of God (Isa.
      42:1); and the apostles are &quot;chosen&quot; for their
      work (Acts 10:41). It is said with regard to those who do
      not profit by their opportunities that &quot;many are
      called, but few are chosen&quot; (Matt. 20:16). (See <a

    <p>
      <a name="T0000817"><b>Chozeba -</b> (1 Chr. 4:22), the same
      as Chezib and Achzib, a place in the lowlands of Judah
      (Gen. 38:5; Josh. 15:44).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000818"><b>Christ -</b> anointed, the Greek
      translation of the Hebrew word rendered &quot;Messiah&quot;
      (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five
      hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes
      that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive
      work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is
      Jesus the Christ (Acts 17:3; 18:5; Matt. 22:42), the
      Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by Isaiah (61:1), and by
      Daniel (9:24-26), who styles him &quot;Messiah the
      Prince.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Messiah is the same person as &quot;the seed of the
      woman&quot; (Gen. 3:15), &quot;the seed of Abraham&quot;
      (Gen. 22:18), the &quot;Prophet like unto Moses&quot;
      (Deut. 18:15), &quot;the priest after the order of
      Melchizedek&quot; (Ps. 110:4), &quot;the rod out of the
      stem of Jesse&quot; (Isa. 11:1, 10), the
      &quot;Immanuel,&quot; the virgin&#39;s son (Isa. 7:14),
      &quot;the branch of Jehovah&quot; (Isa. 4:2), and &quot;the
      messenger of the covenant&quot; (Mal. 3:1). This is he
      &quot;of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did
      write.&quot; The Old Testament Scripture is full of
      prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and
      the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus
      the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men.
      This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed,
      commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men (Heb.
      5:4; Isa. 11:2-4; 49:6; John 5:37; Acts 2:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      To believe that &quot;Jesus is the Christ&quot; is to
      believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the
      prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word,
      what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by
      the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That
      Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith
      of this constitutes a Christian (1 Cor. 12:3; 1 John 5:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000819"><b>Christian -</b> the name given by the
      Greeks or Romans, probably in reproach, to the followers of
      Jesus. It was first used at Antioch. The names by which the
      disciples were known among themselves were
      &quot;brethren,&quot; &quot;the faithful,&quot;
      &quot;elect,&quot; &quot;saints,&quot;
      &quot;believers.&quot; But as distinguishing them from the
      multitude without, the name &quot;Christian&quot; came into
      use, and was universally accepted. This name occurs but
      three times in the New Testament (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pet.
      4:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000820"><b>Christs, False -</b> Our Lord warned
      his disciples that they would arise (Matt. 24:24). It is
      said that no fewer than twenty-four persons have at
      different times appeared (the last in 1682) pretending to
      be the Messiah of the prophets.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000821"><b>Chronicles -</b> the words of the
      days, (1 Kings 14:19; 1 Chr. 27:24), the daily or yearly
      records of the transactions of the kingdom; events recorded
      in the order of time.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000822"><b>Chronicles, Books of -</b> The two
      books were originally one. They bore the title in the
      Massoretic Hebrew <i>Dibre hayyamim</i>, i.e., &quot;Acts
      of the Days.&quot; This title was rendered by Jerome in his
      Latin version &quot;Chronicon,&quot; and hence
      &quot;Chronicles.&quot; In the Septuagint version the book
      is divided into two, and bears the title Paraleipomena,
      i.e., &quot;things omitted,&quot; or
      &quot;supplements&quot;, because containing many things
      omitted in the Books of Kings.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of these books are comprehended under four
      heads. (1.) The first nine chapters of Book I. contain
      little more than a list of genealogies in the line of
      Israel down to the time of David. (2.) The remainder of the
      first book contains a history of the reign of David. (3.)
      The first nine chapters of Book II. contain the history of
      the reign of Solomon. (4.) The remaining chapters of the
      second book contain the history of the separate kingdom of
      Judah to the time of the return from Babylonian Exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there is
      every ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian
      Exile, probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of
      this twofold book, both as to matter and form, correspond
      closely with this idea. The close of the book records the
      proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to
      their own land, and this forms the opening passage of the
      Book of Ezra, which must be viewed as a continuation of the
      Chronicles. The peculiar form of the language, being
      Aramaean in its general character, harmonizes also with
      that of the books which were written after the Exile. The
      author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, details
      of whose family history are given (1 Chr. 3:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of the composition being determined, the question
      of the authorship may be more easily decided. According to
      Jewish tradition, which was universally received down to
      the middle of the seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as
      the author of the Chronicles. There are many points of
      resemblance and of contact between the Chronicles and the
      Book of Ezra which seem to confirm this opinion. The
      conclusion of the one and the beginning of the other are
      almost identical in expression. In their spirit and
      characteristics they are the same, showing thus also an
      identity of authorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their general scope and design these books are not so
      much historical as didactic. The principal aim of the
      writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth.
      He does not give prominence to political occurences, as is
      done in Samuel and Kings, but to ecclesiastical
      institutions. &quot;The genealogies, so uninteresting to
      most modern readers, were really an important part of the
      public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on
      which not only the land was distributed and held, but the
      public services of the temple were arranged and conducted,
      the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known,
      being entitled and first fruits set apart for that
      purpose.&quot; The &quot;Chronicles&quot; are an epitome of
      the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return
      from Babylonian Exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The
      writer gathers up &quot;the threads of the old national
      life broken by the Captivity.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were
      public records, registers, and genealogical tables
      belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course
      of the book (1 Chr. 27:24; 29:29; 2 Chr. 9:29; 12:15;
      13:22; 20:34; 24:27; 26:22; 32:32; 33:18, 19; 27:7; 35:25).
      There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings,
      forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer both
      knew and used these records (1 Chr. 17:18; comp. 2 Sam.
      7:18-20; 1 Chr. 19; comp. 2 Sam. 10, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles
      omits many particulars there recorded (2 Sam. 6:20-23; 9;
      11; 14-19, etc.), and includes many things peculiar to
      itself (1 Chr. 12; 22; 23-26; 27; 28; 29, etc.). Twenty
      whole chapters, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are
      occupied with matter not found elsewhere. It also records
      many things in fuller detail, as (e.g.) the list of
      David&#39;s heroes (1 Chr. 12:1-37), the removal of the ark
      from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion (1 Chr. 13; 15:2-24;
      16:4-43; comp. 2 Sam. 6), Uzziah&#39;s leprosy and its
      cause (2 Chr. 26:16-21; comp. 2 Kings 15:5), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the
      book is that it substitutes modern and more common
      expressions for those that had then become unusual or
      obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of
      modern names of places, such as were in use in the
      writer&#39;s day, for the old names; thus Gezer (1 Chr.
      20:4) is used instead of Gob (2 Sam. 21:18), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the <i>
      khethubim</i> or hagiographa. They are alluded to, though
      not directly quoted, in the New Testament (Heb. 5:4; Matt.
      12:42; 23:35; Luke 1:5; 11:31, 51).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000823"><b>Chronicles of king David -</b> (1
      Chr. 27:24) were statistical state records; one of the
      public sources from which the compiler of the Books of
      Chronicles derived information on various public
      matters.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000824"><b>Chronology -</b> is the arrangement
      of facts and events in the order of time. The writers of
      the Bible themselves do not adopt any standard era
      according to which they date events. Sometimes the years
      are reckoned, e.g., from the time of the Exodus (Num. 1:1;
      33:38; 1 Kings 6:1), and sometimes from the accession of
      kings (1 Kings 15:1, 9, 25, 33, etc.), and sometimes again
      from the return from Exile (Ezra 3:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence in constructing a system of Biblecal chronology, the
      plan has been adopted of reckoning the years from the ages
      of the patriarchs before the birth of their first-born sons
      for the period from the Creation to Abraham. After this
      period other data are to be taken into account in
      determining the relative sequence of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the patriarchal period, there are three principal
      systems of chronology: (1) that of the Hebrew text, (2)
      that of the Septuagint version, and (3) that of the
      Samaritan Pentateuch, as seen in the scheme on the opposite
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Samaritan and the Septuagint have considerably modified
      the Hebrew chronology. This modification some regard as
      having been wilfully made, and to be rejected. The same
      system of variations is observed in the chronology of the
      period between the Flood and Abraham. Thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      | Hebrew Septuigant Samaritan | From the birth of |
      Arphaxad, 2 years | after the Flood, to | the birth of
      Terah. 220 1000 870 | From the birth of | Terah to the
      birth | of Abraham. 130 70 72
    </p>
    <p>
      The Septuagint fixes on seventy years as the age of Terah
      at the birth of Abraham, from Gen. 11:26; but a comparison
      of Gen. 11:32 and Acts 7:4 with Gen. 12:4 shows that when
      Terah died, at the age of two hundred and five years,
      Abraham was seventy-five years, and hence Terah must have
      been one hundred and thirty years when Abraham was born.
      Thus, including the two years from the Flood to the birth
      of Arphaxad, the period from the Flood to the birth of
      Abraham was three hundred and fifty-two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next period is from the birth of Abraham to the Exodus.
      This, according to the Hebrew, extends to five hundred and
      five years. The difficulty here is as to the four hundred
      and thirty years mentioned Ex. 12:40, 41; Gal. 3:17. These
      years are regarded by some as dating from the covenant with
      Abraham (Gen. 15), which was entered into soon after his
      sojourn in Egypt; others, with more probability, reckon
      these years from Jacob&#39;s going down into Egypt. (See <a

    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times the systems of Biblical chronology that
      have been adopted are chiefly those of Ussher and Hales.
      The former follows the Hebrew, and the latter the
      Septuagint mainly. Archbishop Ussher&#39;s (died 1656)
      system is called the short chronology. It is that given on
      the margin of the Authorized Version, but is really of no
      authority, and is quite uncertain.

      bronze or copper) from it for the temple (1 Chr. 18:8). It

      Berothah in Ezek. 47:16.</a>

      <a name="T0000828"><b>Church -</b> Derived probably from
      the Greek kuriakon (i.e., &quot;the Lord&#39;s
      house&quot;), which was used by ancient authors for the
      place of worship.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament it is the translation of the Greek
      word ecclesia, which is synonymous with the Hebrew <i>
      kahal</i> of the Old Testament, both words meaning simply
      an assembly, the character of which can only be known from
      the connection in which the word is found. There is no
      clear instance of its being used for a place of meeting or
      of worship, although in post-apostolic times it early
      received this meaning. Nor is this word ever used to denote
      the inhabitants of a country united in the same profession,
      as when we say the &quot;Church of England,&quot; the
      &quot;Church of Scotland,&quot; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find the word ecclesia used in the following senses in
      the New Testament: (1.) It is translated
      &quot;assembly&quot; in the ordinary classical sense (Acts
      19:32, 39, 41).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) It denotes the whole body of the redeemed, all those
      whom the Father has given to Christ, the invisible catholic
      church (Eph. 5:23, 25, 27, 29; Heb. 12:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A few Christians associated together in observing the
      ordinances of the gospel are an ecclesia (Rom. 16:5; Col.
      4:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) All the Christians in a particular city, whether they
      assembled together in one place or in several places for
      religious worship, were an ecclesia. Thus all the disciples
      in Antioch, forming several congregations, were one church
      (Acts 13:1); so also we read of the &quot;church of God at
      Corinth&quot; (1 Cor. 1:2), &quot;the church at
      Jerusalem&quot; (Acts 8:1), &quot;the church of
      Ephesus&quot; (Rev. 2:1), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The whole body of professing Christians throughout the
      world (1 Cor. 15:9; Gal. 1:13; Matt. 16:18) are the church
      of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church visible &quot;consists of all those throughout
      the world that profess the true religion, together with
      their children.&quot; It is called &quot;visible&quot;
      because its members are known and its assemblies are
      public. Here there is a mixture of &quot;wheat and
      chaff,&quot; of saints and sinners. &quot;God has commanded
      his people to organize themselves into distinct visible
      ecclesiastical communities, with constitutions, laws, and
      officers, badges, ordinances, and discipline, for the great
      purpose of giving visibility to his kingdom, of making
      known the gospel of that kingdom, and of gathering in all
      its elect subjects. Each one of these distinct organized
      communities which is faithful to the great King is an
      integral part of the visible church, and all together
      constitute the catholic or universal visible church.&quot;
      A credible profession of the true religion constitutes a
      person a member of this church. This is &quot;the kingdom
      of heaven,&quot; whose character and progress are set forth
      in the parables recorded in Matt. 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children of all who thus profess the true religion are
      members of the visible church along with their parents.
      Children are included in every covenant God ever made with
      man. They go along with their parents (Gen. 9:9-17; 12:1-3;
      17:7; Ex. 20:5; Deut. 29:10-13). Peter, on the day of
      Pentecost, at the beginning of the New Testament
      dispensation, announces the same great principle. &quot;The
      promise [just as to Abraham and his seed the promises were
      made] is unto you, and to your children&quot; (Acts 2:38,
      39). The children of believing parents are
      &quot;holy&quot;, i.e., are &quot;saints&quot;, a title
      which designates the members of the Christian church (1
      Cor. 7:14). (See <a href=

      BAPTISM</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The church invisible &quot;consists of the whole number of
      the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into
      one under Christ, the head thereof.&quot; This is a pure
      society, the church in which Christ dwells. It is the body
      of Christ. it is called &quot;invisible&quot; because the
      greater part of those who constitute it are already in
      heaven or are yet unborn, and also because its members
      still on earth cannot certainly be distinguished. The
      qualifications of membership in it are internal and are
      hidden. It is unseen except by Him who &quot;searches the
      heart.&quot; &quot;The Lord knoweth them that are his&quot;
      (2 Tim. 2:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      The church to which the attributes, prerogatives, and
      promises appertaining to Christ&#39;s kingdom belong, is a
      spiritual body consisting of all true believers, i.e., the
      church invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Its unity. God has ever had only one church on earth.
      We sometimes speak of the Old Testament Church and of the
      New Testament church, but they are one and the same. The
      Old Testament church was not to be changed but enlarged
      (Isa. 49:13-23; 60:1-14). When the Jews are at length
      restored, they will not enter a new church, but will be
      grafted again into &quot;their own olive tree&quot; (Rom.
      11:18-24; comp. Eph. 2:11-22). The apostles did not set up
      a new organization. Under their ministry disciples were
      &quot;added&quot; to the &quot;church&quot; already
      existing (Acts 2:47).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Its universality. It is the &quot;catholic&quot;
      church; not confined to any particular country or outward
      organization, but comprehending all believers throughout
      the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Its perpetuity. It will continue through all ages to
      the end of the world. It can never be destroyed. It is an
      &quot;everlasting kindgdom.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000829"><b>Churl -</b> in Isa. 32:5 (R.V. marg.,
      &quot;crafty&quot;), means a deceiver. In 1 Sam. 25:3, the
      word churlish denotes a man that is coarse and ill-natured,
      or, as the word literally means, &quot;hard.&quot; The same
      Greek word as used by the LXX. here is found in Matt.
      25:24, and there is rendered &quot;hard.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000830"><b>Chushan-rishathaim -</b> Cush of
      double wickedness, or governor of two presidencies, the
      king of Mesopotamia who oppressed Israel in the generation
      immediately following Joshua (Judg. 3:8). We learn from the
      Tell-el-Amarna tablets that Palestine had been invaded by
      the forces of Aram-naharaim (A.V., &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;)
      more than once, long before the Exodus, and that at the
      time they were written the king of Aram-naharaim was still
      intriguing in Canaan. It is mentioned among the countries
      which took part in the attack upon Egypt in the reign of
      Rameses III. (of the Twentieth Dynasty), but as its king is
      not one of the princes stated to have been conquered by the
      Pharaoh, it would seem that he did not actually enter
      Egypt. As the reign of Rameses III. corresponds with the
      Israelitish occupation of Canaan, it is probable that the
      Egyptian monuments refer to the oppression of the
      Israelites by Chushan-rishathaim. Canaan was still regarded
      as a province of Egypt, so that, in attacking it
      Chushan-rishathaim would have been considered to be
      attacking Egypt.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000831"><b>Cilicia -</b> a maritime province in
      the south-east of Asia Minor. Tarsus, the birth-place of
      Paul, was one of its chief towns, and the seat of a
      celebrated school of philosophy. Its luxurious climate
      attracted to it many Greek residents after its
      incorporation with the Macedonian empire. It was formed
      into a Roman province, B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a
      synagogue at Jerusalem (Acts 6:9). Paul visited it soon
      after his conversion (Gal. 1:21; Acts 9:30), and again, on
      his second missionary journey (15:41), &quot;he went
      through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.&quot;
      It was famous for its goat&#39;s-hair cloth, called
      cilicium. Paul learned in his youth the trade of making
      tents of this cloth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000832"><b>Cinnamon -</b> Heb. kinamon, the
      Cinnamomum zeylanicum of botanists, a tree of the Laurel
      family, which grows only in India on the Malabar coast, in
      Ceylon, and China. There is no trace of it in Egypt, and it
      was unknown in Syria. The inner rind when dried and rolled
      into cylinders forms the cinnamon of commerce. The fruit
      and coarser pieces of bark when boiled yield a fragrant
      oil. It was one of the principal ingredients in the holy
      anointing oil (Ex. 30:23). It is mentioned elsewhere only
      in Prov. 7:17; Cant. 4:14; Rev. 18:13. The mention of it
      indicates a very early and extensive commerce carried on
      between Palestine and the East.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000833"><b>Cinnereth -</b> a harp, one of the
      &quot;fenced cities&quot; of Naphtali (Josh. 19:35; comp.
      Deut. 3:17). It also denotes, apparently, a district which
      may have taken its name from the adjacent city or lake of
      Gennesaret, anciently called &quot;the sea of
      Chinnereth&quot; (q.v.), and was probably that enclosed
      district north of Tiberias afterwards called &quot;the
      plain of Gennesaret.&quot; Called Chinneroth (R.V.,
      Chinnereth) Josh. 11:2. The phrase &quot;all Cinneroth,
      with all the land of Naphtali&quot; in 1 Kings 15:20 is
      parallel to &quot;the store-houses of the cities of
      Naphtali&quot; (R.V. marg.) in 2 Chr. 16:4.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000834"><b>Circuit -</b> the apparent diurnal
      revolution of the sun round the earth (Ps. 19:6), and the
      changes of the wind (Eccl. 1:6). In Job 22:14, &quot;in the
      circuit of heaven&quot; (R.V. marg., &quot;on the vault of
      heaven&quot;) means the &quot;arch of heaven,&quot; which
      seems to be bent over our heads.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000835"><b>Circumcision -</b> cutting around.
      This rite, practised before, as some think, by divers
      races, was appointed by God to be the special badge of his
      chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to
      him. It was established as a national ordinance (Gen.
      17:10, 11). In compliance with the divine command, Abraham,
      though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the
      same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old
      (17:24-27). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were
      circumcised (17:12, 13); and all foreigners must have their
      males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of
      Jewish citizenship (Ex. 12:48). During the journey through
      the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into
      disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before
      they entered the Promised Land (Josh. 5:2-9). It was
      observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel,
      although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the
      settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450
      years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this
      covenant distinction (Judg. 14:3; 15:18; 1 Sam. 14:6;
      17:26; 2 Sam. 1:20; Ezek. 31:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament
      times began (Gal. 6:15; Col. 3:11). Some Jewish Christians
      sought to impose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but
      this the apostles resolutely resisted (Acts 15:1; Gal.
      6:12). Our Lord was circumcised, for it &quot;became him to
      fulfil all righteousness,&quot; as of the seed of Abraham,
      according to the flesh; and Paul &quot;took and
      circumcised&quot; Timothy (Acts 16:3), to avoid giving
      offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy&#39;s labours
      more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no means
      consent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised
      (Gal. 2:3-5). The great point for which he contended was
      the free admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the
      church. He contended successfully in behalf of Titus, even
      in Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached to
      circumcision. It was the symbol of purity (Isa. 52:1). We
      read of uncircumcised lips (Ex. 6:12, 30), ears (Jer.
      6:10), hearts (Lev. 26:41). The fruit of a tree that is
      unclean is spoken of as uncircumcised (Lev. 19:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sign and seal of the covenant of grace as well as
      of the national covenant between God and the Hebrews. (1.)
      It sealed the promises made to Abraham, which related to
      the commonwealth of Israel, national promises. (2.) But the
      promises made to Abraham included the promise of redemption
      (Gal. 3:14), a promise which has come upon us. The covenant
      with Abraham was a dispensation or a specific form of the
      covenant of grace, and circumcision was a sign and seal of
      that covenant. It had a spiritual meaning. It signified
      purification of the heart, inward circumcision effected by
      the Spirit (Deut. 10:16; 30:6; Ezek. 44:7; Acts 7:51; Rom.
      2:28; Col. 2:11). Circumcision as a symbol shadowing forth
      sanctification by the Holy Spirit has now given way to the
      symbol of baptism (q.v.). But the truth embodied in both
      ordinances is ever the same, the removal of sin, the
      sanctifying effects of grace in the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Jewish dispensation, church and state were
      identical. No one could be a member of the one without also
      being a member of the other. Circumcision was a sign and
      seal of membership in both. Every circumcised person bore
      thereby evidence that he was one of the chosen people, a
      member of the church of God as it then existed, and
      consequently also a member of the Jewish commonwealth.

      Hebrew word <i>bor</i>, which means a receptacle for water
      conveyed to it; distinguished from <i>beer</i>, which
      denotes a place where water rises on the spot (Jer. 2:13;
      Prov. 5:15; Isa. 36:16), a fountain. Cisterns are
      frequently mentioned in Scripture. The scarcity of springs
      in Palestine made it necessary to collect rain-water in
      reservoirs and cisterns (Num. 21:22). (See <a href=

      Empty cisterns were sometimes used as prisons (Jer. 38:6;
      Lam. 3:53; Ps. 40:2; 69:15). The &quot;pit&quot; into which
      Joseph was cast (Gen. 37:24) was a <i>beer</i> or dry well.
      There are numerous remains of ancient cisterns in all parts
      of Palestine.

      <a name="T0000837"><b>Citizenship -</b> the rights and
      privileges of a citizen in distinction from a foreigner
      (Luke 15:15; 19:14; Acts 21:39). Under the Mosaic law
      non-Israelites, with the exception of the Moabites and the
      Ammonites and others mentioned in Deut. 23:1-3, were
      admitted to the general privileges of citizenship among the
      Jews (Ex. 12:19; Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15; 35:15; Deut.
      10:18; 14:29; 16:10, 14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The right of citizenship under the Roman government was
      granted by the emperor to individuals, and sometimes to
      provinces, as a favour or as a recompense for services
      rendered to the state, or for a sum of money (Acts 22:28).
      This &quot;freedom&quot; secured privileges equal to those
      enjoyed by natives of Rome. Among the most notable of these
      was the provision that a man could not be bound or
      imprisoned without a formal trial (Acts 22:25, 26), or
      scourged (16:37). All Roman citizens had the right of
      appeal to Caesar (25:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000838"><b>City -</b> The earliest mention of
      city-building is that of Enoch, which was built by Cain
      (Gen. 4:17). After the confusion of tongues, the
      descendants of Nimrod founded several cities (10:10-12).
      Next, we have a record of the cities of the Canaanites,
      Sidon, Gaza, Sodom, etc. (10:12, 19; 11:3, 9; 36:31-39).
      The earliest description of a city is that of Sodom
      (19:1-22). Damascus is said to be the oldest existing city
      in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities
      in Egypt (Num. 13:22). The Israelites in Egypt were
      employed in building the &quot;treasure cities&quot; of
      Pithom and Raamses (Ex. 1:11); but it does not seem that
      they had any cities of their own in Goshen (Gen. 46:34;
      47:1-11). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty
      &quot;great cities with walls,&quot; and twenty-three
      cities in Gilead partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east
      of Jordan (Num. 21:21, 32, 33, 35; 32:1-3, 34-42; Deut.
      3:4, 5, 14; 1 Kings 4:13). On the west of Jordan were
      thirty-one &quot;royal cities&quot; (Josh. 12), besides
      many others spoken of in the history of Israel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A fenced city was a city surrounded by fortifications and
      high walls, with watch-towers upon them (2 Chr. 11:11;
      Deut. 3:5). There was also within the city generally a
      tower to which the citizens might flee when danger
      threatened them (Judg. 9:46-52).
    </p>
    <p>
      A city with suburbs was a city surrounded with open
      pasture-grounds, such as the forty-eight cities which were
      given to the Levites (Num. 35:2-7). There were six cities
      of refuge, three on each side of Jordan, namely, Kadesh,
      Shechem, Hebron, on the west of Jordan; and on the east,
      Bezer, Ramoth-gilead, and Golan. The cities on each side of
      the river were nearly opposite each other. The regulations
      concerning these cities are given in Num. 35:9-34; Deut.
      19:1-13; Ex. 21:12-14.
    </p>
    <p>
      When David reduced the fortress of the Jebusites which
      stood on Mount Zion, he built on the site of it a palace
      and a city, which he called by his own name (1 Chr. 11:5),
      the city of David. Bethlehem is also so called as being
      David&#39;s native town (Luke 2:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerusalem is called the Holy City, the holiness of the
      temple being regarded as extending in some measure over the
      whole city (Neh. 11:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Pithom and Raamses, built by the Israelites as
      &quot;treasure cities,&quot; were not places where royal
      treasures were kept, but were fortified towns where
      merchants might store their goods and transact their
      business in safety, or cities in which munitions of war
      were stored. (See <a href=

      name of the emperor, his patron, Tiberius Claudius, and
      that she was the wife of Pudens.</a>

      <a name="T0000841"><b>Claudius -</b> lame. (1.) The fourth
      Roman emperor. He succeeded Caligula (A.D. 41). Though in
      general he treated the Jews, especially those in Asia and
      Egypt, with great indulgence, yet about the middle of his
      reign (A.D. 49) he banished them all from Rome (Acts 18:2).
      In this edict the Christians were included, as being, as
      was supposed, a sect of Jews. The Jews, however soon again
      returned to Rome.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the reign of this emperor, several persecutions of
      the Christians by the Jews took place in the dominions of
      Herod Agrippa, in one of which the apostle James was
      &quot;killed&quot; (12:2). He died A.D. 54.

      sediment found in pits or in streets (Isa. 57:20; Jer.
      38:60), of dust mixed with spittle (John 9:6), and of
      potter&#39;s clay (Isa. 41:25; Nah. 3:14; Jer. 18:1-6; Rom.
      9:21). Clay was used for sealing (Job 38:14; Jer. 32:14).
      Our Lord&#39;s tomb may have been thus sealed (Matt.
      27:66). The practice of sealing doors with clay is still
      common in the East. Clay was also in primitive times used
      for mortar (Gen. 11:3). The &quot;clay ground&quot; in
      which the large vessels of the temple were cast (1 Kings
      7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17) was a compact loam fitted for the
      purpose. The expression literally rendered is, &quot;in the
      thickness of the ground,&quot;, meaning, &quot;in stiff
      ground&quot; or in clay.</a>

      uncleanness according to the Mosaic law are enumerated in
      Lev. 11-15; Num. 19. The division of animals into clean and
      unclean was probably founded on the practice of sacrifice.
      It existed before the Flood (Gen. 7:2). The regulations
      regarding such animals are recorded in Lev. 11 and Deut.
      14:1-21.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrews were prohibited from using as food certain
      animal substances, such as (1) blood; (2) the fat covering
      the intestines, termed the caul; (3) the fat on the
      intestines, called the mesentery; (4) the fat of the
      kidneys; and (5) the fat tail of certain sheep (Ex. 29:13,
      22; Lev. 3:4-9; 9:19; 17:10; 19:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief design of these regulations seems to have been to
      establish a system of regimen which would distinguish the
      Jews from all other nations. Regarding the design and the
      abolition of these regulations the reader will find all the
      details in Lev. 20:24-26; Acts 10:9-16; 11:1-10; Heb.

      Clement of Rome whose name is well known in church history,
      and that he was the author of an Epistle to the
      Corinthians, the only known manuscript of which is appended
      to the Alexandrian Codex, now in the British Museum. It is
      of some historical interest, and has given rise to much

      rather Cleopas, which is the Greek form of the word, while
      Clopas is the Aramaic form. In John 19:25 the Authorized
      Version reads, &quot;Mary, the wife of Clopas.&quot; The
      word &quot;wife&quot; is conjecturally inserted here. If
      &quot;wife&quot; is rightly inserted, then Mary was the
      mother of James the Less, and Clopas is the same as

      rendered is elsewhere rendered &quot;robe&quot; or
      &quot;mantle.&quot; It was worn by the high priest under
      the ephod (Ex. 28:31), by kings and others of rank (1 Sam.
      15:27; Job 1:20; 2:12), and by women (2 Sam. 13:18).</a>

    <p>
      The word translated &quot;cloke&quot;, i.e., outer garment,
      in Matt. 5:40 is in its plural form used of garments in
      general (Matt. 17:2; 26:65). The cloak mentioned here and
      in Luke 6:29 was the Greek himation, Latin pallium, and
      consisted of a large square piece of wollen cloth fastened
      round the shoulders, like the abba of the Arabs. This could
      be taken by a creditor (Ex. 22:26,27), but the coat or
      tunic (Gr. chiton) mentioned in Matt. 5:40 could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloak which Paul &quot;left at Troas&quot; (2 Tim.

      chiefly in travelling as a protection from the weather.
      Some, however, have supposed that what Paul meant was a
      travelling-bag. In the Syriac version the word used means a
      bookcase. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000849"><b>Cloud -</b> The Hebrew so rendered
      means &quot;a covering,&quot; because clouds cover the sky.
      The word is used as a symbol of the Divine presence, as
      indicating the splendour of that glory which it conceals
      (Ex. 16:10; 33:9; Num. 11:25; 12:5; Job 22:14; Ps. 18:11).
      A &quot;cloud without rain&quot; is a proverbial saying,
      denoting a man who does not keep his promise (Prov. 16:15;
      Isa. 18:4; 25:5; Jude 1:12). A cloud is the figure of that
      which is transitory (Job 30:15; Hos. 6:4). A bright cloud
      is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence (Ex.29:42,
      43; 1 Kings 8:10; 2 Chr. 5:14; Ezek. 43:4), and was called
      the Shechinah (q.v.). Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a
      cloud (Ex. 19:9); and the cloud filled the court around the
      tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter
      it (Ex. 40:34, 35). At the dedication of the temple also
      the cloud &quot;filled the house of the Lord&quot; (1 Kings
      8:10). Thus in like manner when Christ comes the second
      time he is described as coming &quot;in the clouds&quot;
      (Matt. 17:5; 24:30; Acts 1:9, 11). False teachers are
      likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest (2 Pet.
      2:17). The infirmities of old age, which come one after
      another, are compared by Solomon to &quot;clouds returning
      after the rain&quot; (Eccl. 12:2). The blotting out of sins
      is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from
      the sky (Isa. 44:22).</a>

      Cloud, the pillar of, was the glory-cloud which indicated
      God&#39;s presence leading the ransomed people through the
      wilderness (Ex. 13:22; 33:9, 10). This pillar preceded the
      people as they marched, resting on the ark (Ex. 13:21;
      40:36). By night it became a pillar of fire (Num. 9:17-23).

      <a name="T0000851"><b>Coal -</b> It is by no means certain
      that the Hebrews were acquainted with mineral coal,
      although it is found in Syria. Their common fuel was dried
      dung of animals and wood charcoal. Two different words are
      found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring in Prov.
      26:21, &quot;As coal [Heb. peham; i.e., &quot;black
      coal&quot;] is to burning coal [Heb. gehalim].&quot; The
      latter of these words is used in Job 41:21; Prov. 6:28;
      Isa. 44:19. The words &quot;live coal&quot; in Isa. 6:6 are
      more correctly &quot;glowing stone.&quot; In Lam. 4:8 the
      expression &quot;blacker than a coal&quot; is literally
      rendered in the margin of the Revised Version &quot;darker
      than blackness.&quot; &quot;Coals of fire&quot; (2 Sam.
      22:9, 13; Ps. 18:8, 12, 13, etc.) is an expression used
      metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false
      tongue is compared to &quot;coals of juniper&quot; (Ps.
      120:4; James 3:6). &quot;Heaping coals of fire on the
      head&quot; symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words
      of Paul (Rom. 12:20) are equivalent to saying, &quot;By
      charity and kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as
      surely as heaping coals on the fire fuses the metal in the

      God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing more than aprons
      (Gen. 3:21). This tunic was sometimes woven entire without
      a seam (John 19:23); it was also sometimes of &quot;many
      colours&quot; (Gen. 37:3; R.V. marg., &quot;a long garment
      with sleeves&quot;). The &quot;fisher&#39;s coat&quot; of
      John 21:7 was obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was
      also the &quot;coat&quot; made by Hannah for Samuel (1 Sam.

      hours, the first beginning at six o&#39;clock in the
      evening (Luke 12:38; Matt. 14:25; Mark 6:48). But the
      ancient division, known as the first and second
      cock-crowing, was still retained. The cock usually crows
      several times soon after midnight (this is the first
      crowing), and again at the dawn of day (and this is the
      second crowing). Mark mentions (14:30) the two
      cock-crowings. Matthew (26:34) alludes to that only which
      was emphatically the cock-crowing, viz, the second.</a>

      <a name="T0000856"><b>Cockle -</b> occurs only in Job 31:40
      (marg., &quot;noisome weeds&quot;), where it is the
      rendering of a Hebrew word (b&#39;oshah) which means
      &quot;offensive,&quot; &quot;having a bad smell,&quot;
      referring to some weed perhaps which has an unpleasant
      odour. Or it may be regarded as simply any noisome weed,
      such as the &quot;tares&quot; or darnel of Matt. 13:30. In
      Isa. 5:2, 4 the plural form is rendered &quot;wild
      grapes.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000857"><b>Coele-Syria -</b> hollow Syria, the

      extensive valley, about 100 miles long, between the Lebanon
      and the Anti-Lebanon range of mountains.</a>

      <a name="T0000858"><b>Coffer -</b> the receptacle or small
      box placed beside the ark by the Philistines, in which they
      deposited the golden mice and the emerods as their
      trespass-offering (1 Sam. 6:8, 11, 15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000859"><b>Coffin -</b> used in Gen. 50:26 with
      reference to the burial of Joseph. Here, it means a
      mummy-chest. The same Hebrew word is rendered
      &quot;chest&quot; in 2 Kings 12:9, 10.</a>

      <a name="T0000860"><b>Cogitations -</b> (or
      &quot;thoughts,&quot; as the Chaldee word in Dan. 7:28
      literally means), earnest meditation.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000861"><b>Coin -</b> Before the Exile the Jews
      had no regularly stamped money. They made use of uncoined
      shekels or talents of silver, which they weighed out (Gen.
      23:16; Ex. 38:24; 2 Sam. 18:12). Probably the silver ingots
      used in the time of Abraham may have been of a fixed
      weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The
      &quot;pieces of silver&quot; paid by Abimelech to Abraham
      (Gen. 20:16), and those also for which Joseph was sold
      (37:28), were proably in the form of rings. The shekel was
      the common standard of weight and value among the Hebrews
      down to the time of the Captivity. Only once is a shekel of
      gold mentioned (1 Chr. 21:25). The &quot;six thousand of
      gold&quot; mentioned in the transaction between Naaman and
      Gehazi (2 Kings 5:5) were probably so many shekels of gold.
      The &quot;piece of money&quot; mentioned in Job 42:11; Gen.
      33:19 (marg., &quot;lambs&quot;) was the Hebrew <i>
      kesitah</i>, probably an uncoined piece of silver of a
      certain weight in the form of a sheep or lamb, or perhaps
      having on it such an impression. The same Hebrew word is
      used in Josh. 24:32, which is rendered by Wickliffe
      &quot;an hundred yonge scheep.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000862"><b>Collar -</b> (Heb. peh), means in Job
      30:18 the mouth or opening of the garment that closes round
      the neck in the same way as a tunic (Ex. 39:23). The
      &quot;collars&quot; (Heb. netiphoth) among the spoils of
      the Midianites (Judg. 8:26; R.V., &quot;pendants&quot;)
      were ear-drops. The same Hebrew word is rendered
      &quot;chains&quot; in Isa. 3:19.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000863"><b>Collection -</b> The Christians in
      Palestine, from various causes, suffered from poverty. Paul
      awakened an interest in them among the Gentile churches,
      and made pecuniary collections in their behalf (Acts 24:17;
      Rom. 15:25, 26; 1 Cor. 16:1-3; 2 Cor. 8:9; Gal. 2:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000864"><b>College -</b> Heb. mishneh (2 Kings
      22:14; 2 Chr. 34:22), rendered in Revised Version
      &quot;second quarter&quot;, the residence of the prophetess
      Huldah. The Authorized Version followed the Jewish
      commentators, who, following the Targum, gave the Hebrew
      word its post-Biblical sense, as if it meant a place of
      instruction. It properly means the &quot;second,&quot; and
      may therefore denote the lower city (Acra), which was built
      after the portion of the city on Mount Zion, and was
      enclosed by a second wall.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000865"><b>Colony -</b> The city of Philippi was
      a Roman colony (Acts 16:12), i.e., a military settlement of
      Roman soldiers and citizens, planted there to keep in
      subjection a newly-conquered district. A colony was Rome in
      miniature, under Roman municipal law, but governed by
      military officers (praetors and lictors), not by
      proconsuls. It had an independent internal government, the
      jus Italicum; i.e., the privileges of Italian citizens.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000866"><b>Colossae -</b> or Colosse, a city of
      Phrygia, on the Lycus, which is a tributary of the
      Maeander. It was about 12 miles above Laodicea, and near
      the great road from Ephesus to the Euphrates, and was
      consequently of some mercantile importance. It does not
      appear that Paul had visited this city when he wrote his
      letter to the church there (Col. 1:2). He expresses in his
      letter to Philemon (ver. 1:22) his hope to visit it on
      being delivered from his imprisonment. From Col. 1:7; 4:12
      it has been concluded that Epaphras was the founder of the
      Colossian church. This town afterwards fell into decay, and
      the modern town of Chonas or Chonum occupies a site near
      its ruins.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000867"><b>Colossians, Epistle to the -</b> was
      written by Paul at Rome during his first imprisonment there
      (Acts 28:16, 30), probably in the spring of A.D. 57, or, as
      some think, 62, and soon after he had written his Epistle
      to the Ephesians. Like some of his other epistles (e.g.,
      those to Corinth), this seems to have been written in
      consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed
      to him of the internal state of the church there (Col.
      1:4-8). Its object was to counteract false teaching. A
      large part of it is directed against certain speculatists
      who attempted to combine the doctrines of Oriental
      mysticism and asceticism with Christianity, thereby
      promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual
      life and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. Paul
      argues against such teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus
      they had all things. He sets forth the majesty of his
      redemption. The mention of the &quot;new moon&quot; and
      &quot;sabbath days&quot; (2:16) shows also that there were
      here Judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the
      disciples from the simplicity of the gospel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most of Paul&#39;s epistles, this consists of two
      parts, a doctrinal and a practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters.
      His main theme is developed in chapter 2. He warns them
      against being drawn away from Him in whom dwelt all the
      fulness of the Godhead, and who was the head of all
      spiritual powers. Christ was the head of the body of which
      they were members; and if they were truly united to him,
      what needed they more?
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The practical part of the epistle (3-4) enforces
      various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines
      expounded. They are exhorted to mind things that are above
      (3:1-4), to mortify every evil principle of their nature,
      and to put on the new man (3:5-14). Many special duties of
      the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting
      evidence of the Christian character. Tychicus was the
      bearer of the letter, as he was also of that to the
      Ephesians and to Philemon, and he would tell them of the
      state of the apostle (4:7-9). After friendly greetings
      (10-14), he bids them interchange this letter with that he
      had sent to the neighbouring church of Laodicea. He then
      closes this brief but striking epistle with his usual
      autograph salutation. There is a remarkable resemblance
      between this epistle and that to the Ephesians (q.v.). The
      genuineness of this epistle has not been called in
      question.

      <a name="T0000868"><b>Colour -</b> The subject of colours
      holds an important place in the Scriptures.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      White occurs as the translation of various Hebrew words. It
      is applied to milk (Gen. 49:12), manna (Ex. 16:31), snow
      (Isa. 1:18), horses (Zech. 1:8), raiment (Eccl. 9:8).
      Another Hebrew word so rendered is applied to marble
      (Esther 1:6), and a cognate word to the lily (Cant. 2:16).
      A different term, meaning &quot;dazzling,&quot; is applied
      to the countenance (Cant. 5:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      This colour was an emblem of purity and innocence (Mark
      16:5; John 20:12; Rev. 19:8, 14), of joy (Eccl. 9:8), and
      also of victory (Zech. 6:3; Rev. 6:2). The hangings of the
      tabernacle court (Ex. 27:9; 38:9), the coats, mitres,
      bonnets, and breeches of the priests (Ex. 39:27,28), and
      the dress of the high priest on the day of Atonement (Lev.
      16:4,32), were white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black, applied to the hair (Lev. 13:31; Cant. 5:11), the
      complexion (Cant. 1:5), and to horses (Zech. 6:2,6). The
      word rendered &quot;brown&quot; in Gen. 30:32 (R.V.,
      &quot;black&quot;) means properly &quot;scorched&quot;,
      i.e., the colour produced by the influence of the sun&#39;s
      rays. &quot;Black&quot; in Job 30:30 means dirty, blackened
      by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a
      mourner&#39;s robes (Jer. 8:21; 14:2), to a clouded sky (1
      Kings 18:45), to night (Micah 3:6; Jer. 4:28), and to a
      brook rendered turbid by melted snow (Job 6:16). It is used
      as symbolical of evil in Zech. 6:2, 6 and Rev. 6:5. It was
      the emblem of mourning, affliction, calamity (Jer. 14:2;
      Lam. 4:8; 5:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Red, applied to blood (2 Kings 3;22), a heifer (Num. 19:2),
      pottage of lentils (Gen. 25:30), a horse (Zech. 1:8), wine
      (Prov. 23:31), the complexion (Gen. 25:25; Cant. 5:10).
      This colour is symbolical of bloodshed (Zech. 6:2; Rev.
      6:4; 12:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Purple, a colour obtained from the secretion of a species
      of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was found in the
      Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia
      and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate
      shell-fish amounted to only a single drop, and hence the
      great value of this dye. Robes of this colour were worn by
      kings (Judg. 8:26) and high officers (Esther 8:15). They
      were also worn by the wealthy and luxurious (Jer. 10:9;
      Ezek. 27:7; Luke 16:19; Rev. 17:4). With this colour was
      associated the idea of royalty and majesty (Judg. 8:26;
      Cant. 3:10; 7:5; Dan. 5:7, 16,29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue. This colour was also procured from a species of
      shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix
      ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of
      the sky, the deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour
      was used in the same way as purple. The ribbon and fringe
      of the Hebrew dress were of this colour (Num. 15:38). The
      loops of the curtains (Ex. 26:4), the lace of the high
      priest&#39;s breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the
      lace on his mitre, were blue (Ex. 28:28, 31, 37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarlet, or Crimson. In Isa. 1:18 a Hebrew word is used
      which denotes the worm or grub whence this dye was
      procured. In Gen. 38:28,30, the word so rendered means
      &quot;to shine,&quot; and expresses the brilliancy of the
      colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was
      obtained somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in
      Eastern countries. It is called by naturalists Coccus
      ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone. The
      only natural object to which this colour is applied in
      Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet
      thread (Cant. 4:3). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and
      luxurious (2 Sam. 1:24; Prov. 31:21; Jer. 4:30. Rev. 17:4).
      It was also the hue of the warrior&#39;s dress (Nah. 2:3;
      Isa. 9:5). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing
      this colour (2 Chr. 2:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      These four colours--white, purple, blue, and scarlet--were
      used in the textures of the tabernacle curtains (Ex. 26:1,
      31, 36), and also in the high priest&#39;s ephod, girdle,
      and breastplate (Ex. 28:5, 6, 8, 15). Scarlet thread is
      mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing the
      leper (Lev. 14:4, 6, 51) and of burning the red heifer
      (Num. 19:6). It was a crimson thread that Rahab was to bind
      on her window as a sign that she was to be saved alive
      (Josh. 2:18; 6:25) when the city of Jericho was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a
      colour used for drawing the figures of idols on the walls
      of temples (Ezek. 23:14), or for decorating the walls and
      beams of houses (Jer. 22:14).

      &quot;or Advocate, or Helper; Gr. paracletos&quot;). The
      same Greek word thus rendered is translated
      &quot;Advocate&quot; in 1 John 2:1 as applicable to Christ.
      It means properly &quot;one who is summoned to the side of
      another&quot; to help him in a court of justice by
      defending him, &quot;one who is summoned to plead a
      cause.&quot; &quot;Advocate&quot; is the proper rendering
      of the word in every case where it occurs.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the
      word paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when
      he speaks of the &quot;intercession&quot; both of Christ
      and the Spirit (Rom. 8:27, 34).

      reference to his first advent &quot;in the fulness of the

      to his coming again the second time at the last day (Acts
      1:11; 3:20, 21; 1 Thess. 4:15; 2 Tim. 4:1; Heb. 9:28).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression is used metaphorically of the introduction
      of the gospel into any place (John 15:22; Eph. 2:17), the
      visible establishment of his kingdom in the world (Matt.
      16:28), the conferring on his people of the peculiar tokens
      of his love (John 14:18, 23, 28), and his executing
      judgment on the wicked (2 Thess. 2:8).

      <a name="T0000871"><b>Commandments, the Ten -</b> (Ex.
      34:28; Deut. 10:4, marg. &quot;ten words&quot;) i.e., the
      Decalogue (q.v.), is a summary of the immutable moral law.
      These commandments were first given in their written form
      to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai,
      about fifty days after they came out of Egypt (Ex.
      19:10-25). They were written by the finger of God on two
      tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when
      he brought them down from the mount (32:19), being thrown
      by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into
      the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them &quot;the
      words that were on the first tables&quot; (34:1). These
      tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant
      (Deut. 10:5; 1 Kings 8:9). Their subsequent history is
      unknown. They are as a whole called &quot;the
      covenant&quot; (Deut. 4:13), and &quot;the tables of the
      covenant&quot; (9:9, 11; Heb. 9:4), and &quot;the
      testimony.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are obviously &quot;ten&quot; in number, but their
      division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering
      them have been adopted. The Jews make the
      &quot;Preface&quot; one of the commandments, and then
      combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and
      Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth
      into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The
      Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to
      the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and
      Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the
      second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim
      is the mount of worship. (See <a href=

      concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The
      concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various
      laws recorded providing for their protection (Ex. 21:7;
      Deut. 21:10-14), and setting limits to the relation they
      sustained to the household to which they belonged (Gen.
      21:14; 25:6). They had no authority in the family, nor
      could they share in the household government.</a>

      The immediate cause of concubinage might be gathered from

      But in process of time the custom of concubinage
      degenerated, and laws were made to restrain and regulate it
      (Ex. 21:7-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity has restored the sacred institution of
      marriage to its original character, and concubinage is
      ranked with the sins of fornication and adultery (Matt.
      19:5-9; 1 Cor. 7:2).

      (R.V., &quot;coveting&quot;); Col. 3:5 (R.V.,
      &quot;desire&quot;). The &quot;lust of concupiscence&quot;
      (1 Thess. 4:5; R.V., &quot;passion of lust&quot;) denotes
      evil desire, indwelling sin.</a>

      <a name="T0000877"><b>Conduit -</b> a water-course or
      channel (Job 38:25). The &quot;conduit of the upper
      pool&quot; (Isa. 7:3) was formed by Hezekiah for the
      purpose of conveying the waters from the upper pool in the
      valley of Gihon to the west side of the city of David (2
      Kings 18:17; 20:20; 2 Chr. 32:30). In carrying out this
      work he stopped &quot;the waters of the fountains which
      were without the city&quot; i.e., &quot;the upper
      water-course of Gihon&quot;, and conveyed it down from the
      west through a canal into the city, so that in case of a
      siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of
      water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy. (See

    <p>
      There are also the remains of a conduit which conducted
      water from the so-called &quot;Pools of Solomon,&quot;
      beyond Bethlehem, into the city. Water is still conveyed
      into the city from the fountains which supplied these pools
      by a channel which crosses the valley of Hinnom.

      <a name="T0000878"><b>Coney -</b> (Heb. shaphan; i.e.,
      &quot;the hider&quot;), an animal which inhabits the
      mountain gorges and the rocky districts of Arabia Petraea
      and the Holy Land. &quot;The conies are but a feeble folk,
      yet make they their houses in the rocks&quot; (Prov. 30:26;
      Ps. 104:18). They are gregarious, and &quot;exceeding
      wise&quot; (Prov. 30:24), and are described as chewing the
      cud (Lev. 11:5; Deut. 14:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal intended by this name is known among naturalists
      as the Hyrax Syriacus. It is neither a ruminant nor a
      rodent, but is regarded as akin to the rhinoceros. When it
      is said to &quot;chew the cud,&quot; the Hebrew word so
      used does not necessarily imply the possession of a
      ruminant stomach. &quot;The lawgiver speaks according to
      appearances; and no one can watch the constant motion of
      the little creature&#39;s jaws, as it sits continually
      working its teeth, without recognizing the naturalness of
      the expression&quot; (Tristram, Natural History of the
      Bible). It is about the size and color of a rabbit, though
      clumsier in structure, and without a tail. Its feet are not
      formed for digging, and therefore it has its home not in
      burrows but in the clefts of the rocks. &quot;Coney&quot;
      is an obsolete English word for &quot;rabbit.&quot;

      &quot;ointment&quot; in ver. 25; R.V.,
      &quot;perfume&quot;). The Hebrew word so rendered is
      derived from a root meaning to compound oil and
      perfume.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000880"><b>Confectionaries -</b> only in 1 Sam.

      compound species and perfumes.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000881"><b>Confession -</b> (1) An open
      profession of faith (Luke 12:8). (2.) An acknowledment of
      sins to God (Lev. 16:21; Ezra 9:5-15; Dan. 9:3-12), and to
      a neighbour whom we have wronged (James 5:16; Matt.
      18:15).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000882"><b>Congregation -</b> (Heb. kahal), the
      Hebrew people collectively as a holy community (Num.
      15:15). Every circumcised Hebrew from twenty years old and
      upward was a member of the congregation. Strangers resident
      in the land, if circumcised, were, with certain exceptions
      (Ex. 12:19; Num. 9:14; Deut. 23:1-3), admitted to the
      privileges of citizenship, and spoken of as members of the
      congregation (Ex. 12:19; Num. 9:14; 15:15). The
      congregation were summonded together by the sound of two
      silver trumpets, and they met at the door of the tabernacle
      (Num. 10:3). These assemblies were convened for the purpose
      of engaging in solemn religious services (Ex. 12:27; Num.
      25:6; Joel 2:15), or of receiving new commandments (Ex.
      19:7, 8). The elders, who were summonded by the sound of
      one trumpet (Num. 10:4), represented on various occasions
      the whole congregation (Ex. 3:16; 12:21; 17:5; 24:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the conquest of Canaan, the people were assembled
      only on occasions of the highest national importance (Judg.
      20; 2 Chr. 30:5; 34:29; 1 Sam. 10:17; 2 Sam. 5:1-5; 1 Kings
      12:20; 2 Kings 11:19; 21:24; 23:30). In subsequent times
      the congregation was represented by the Sanhedrim; and the
      name synagogue, applied in the Septuagint version
      exclusively to the congregation, came to be used to denote
      the places of worship established by the Jews. (See <a

      it is the same word as that rendered &quot;synagogue&quot;
      (q.v.) in ver. 42, and is so rendered in ver. 43 in R.V.

      <a name="T0000883"><b>Congregation, mount of the -</b>
      (Isa. 14:13), has been supposed to refer to the place where
      God promised to meet with his people (Ex. 25:22; 29:42, 43)
      i.e., the mount of the Divine presence, Mount Zion. But
      here the king of Babylon must be taken as expressing
      himself according to his own heathen notions, and not
      according to those of the Jews. The &quot;mount of the
      congregation&quot; will therefore in this case mean the
      northern mountain, supposed by the Babylonians to be the
      meeting-place of their gods. In the Babylonian inscriptions
      mention is made of a mountain which is described as
      &quot;the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head rivals heaven,
      whose root is the holy deep.&quot; This mountain was
      regarded in their mythology as the place where the gods had
      their seat.</a>

      <a name="T0000884"><b>Conscience -</b> that faculty of the
      mind, or inborn sense of right and wrong, by which we judge
      of the moral character of human conduct. It is common to
      all men. Like all our other faculties, it has been
      perverted by the Fall (John 16:2; Acts 26:9; Rom. 2:15). It
      is spoken of as &quot;defiled&quot; (Titus 1:15), and
      &quot;seared&quot; (1 Tim. 4:2). A &quot;conscience void of
      offence&quot; is to be sought and cultivated (Acts 24:16;
      Rom. 9:1; 2 Cor. 1:12; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 1 Pet. 3:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000885"><b>Consecration -</b> the devoting or
      setting apart of anything to the worship or service of God.
      The race of Abraham and the tribe of Levi were thus
      consecrated (Ex. 13:2, 12, 15; Num. 3:12). The Hebrews
      devoted their fields and cattle, and sometimes the spoils
      of war, to the Lord (Lev. 27:28, 29). According to the
      Mosaic law the first-born both of man and beast were
      consecrated to God.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament, Christians are regarded as
      consecrated to the Lord (1 Pet. 2:9).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000886"><b>Consolation of Israel -</b> a name
      for the Messiah in common use among the Jews, probably
      suggested by Isa. 12:1; 49:13. The Greek word thus rendered
      (Luke 2:25, paraklesis) is kindred to that translated
      &quot;Comforter&quot; in John 14:16, etc., parakletos.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000887"><b>Constellation -</b> a cluster of
      stars, or stars which appear to be near each other in the
      heavens, and which astronomers have reduced to certain
      figures (as the &quot;Great Bear,&quot; the
      &quot;Bull,&quot; etc.) for the sake of classification and
      of memory. In Isa. 13:10, where this word only occurs, it
      is the rendering of the Hebrew <i>kesil</i>, i.e.,
      &quot;fool.&quot; This was the Hebrew name of the
      constellation Orion (Job 9:9; 38:31), a constellation which
      represented Nimrod, the symbol of folly and impiety. The
      word some interpret by &quot;the giant&quot; in this place,
      &quot;some heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the sky
      for his impiety.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000888"><b>Contentment -</b> a state of mind in
      which one&#39;s desires are confined to his lot whatever it
      may be (1 Tim. 6:6; 2 Cor. 9:8). It is opposed to envy
      (James 3:16), avarice (Heb. 13:5), ambition (Prov. 13:10),
      anxiety (Matt. 6:25, 34), and repining (1 Cor. 10:10). It
      arises from the inward disposition, and is the offspring of
      humility, and of an intelligent consideration of the
      rectitude and benignity of divine providence (Ps. 96:1, 2;
      145), the greatness of the divine promises (2 Pet. 1:4),
      and our own unworthiness (Gen. 32:10); as well as from the
      view the gospel opens up to us of rest and peace hereafter
      (Rom. 5:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000889"><b>Conversation -</b> generally the
      goings out and in of social intercourse (Eph. 2:3; 4:22;
      R.V., &quot;manner of life&quot;); one&#39;s deportment or
      course of life. This word is never used in Scripture in the
      sense of verbal communication from one to another (Ps.
      50:23; Heb. 13:5). In Phil. 1:27 and 3:20, a different
      Greek word is used. It there means one&#39;s relations to a
      community as a citizen, i.e., citizenship.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000890"><b>Conversion -</b> the turning of a
      sinner to God (Acts 15:3). In a general sense the heathen
      are said to be &quot;converted&quot; when they abandon
      heathenism and embrace the Christian faith; and in a more
      special sense men are converted when, by the influence of
      divine grace in their souls, their whole life is changed,
      old things pass away, and all things become new (Acts
      26:18). Thus we speak of the conversion of the Philippian
      jailer (16:19-34), of Paul (9:1-22), of the Ethiopian
      treasurer (8:26-40), of Cornelius (10), of Lydia
      (16:13-15), and others. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000891"><b>Convocation -</b> a meeting of a
      religious character as distinguished from congregation,
      which was more general, dealing with political and legal
      matters. Hence it is called an &quot;holy
      convocation.&quot; Such convocations were the Sabbaths
      (Lev. 23:2, 3), the Passover (Ex. 12:16; Lev. 23:7, 8; Num.
      28:25), Pentecost (Lev. 23:21), the feast of Trumpets (Lev.
      23:24; Num. 29:1), the feast of Weeks (Num. 28:26), and the
      feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:35, 36). The great fast, the
      annual day of atonement, was &quot;the holy
      convocation&quot; (Lev. 23:27; Num. 29:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000892"><b>Cook -</b> a person employed to
      perform culinary service. In early times among the Hebrews
      cooking was performed by the mistress of the household
      (Gen. 18:2-6; Judg. 6:19), and the process was very
      expeditiously performed (Gen. 27:3, 4, 9, 10). Professional
      cooks were afterwards employed (1 Sam. 8:13; 9:23). Few
      animals, as a rule, were slaughtered (other than
      sacrifices), except for purposes of hospitality (Gen. 18:7;
      Luke 15:23). The paschal lamb was roasted over a fire (Ex.
      12:8, 9; 2Chr. 35:13). Cooking by boiling was the usual
      method adopted (Lev. 8:31; Ex. 16:23). No cooking took
      place on the Sabbath day (Ex. 35:3).</a>

      <a name="T0000893"><b>Coos -</b> (written Cos in the R.V.),
      a small island, one of the Sporades in the Aegean Sea, in
      the north-west of Rhodes, off the coast of Caria. Paul on
      his return from his third missionary journey, passed the
      night here after sailing from Miletus (Acts 21:1). It is
      now called Stanchio.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000894"><b>Copper -</b> derived from the Greek
      kupros (the island of Cyprus), called &quot;Cyprian
      brass,&quot; occurs only in the Authorized Version in Ezra
      8:27. Elsewhere the Hebrew word (nehosheth) is improperly
      rendered &quot;brass,&quot; and sometimes &quot;steel&quot;
      (2 Sam. 22:35; Jer. 15:12). The &quot;bow of steel&quot;
      (Job 20:24; Ps. 18:34) should have been &quot;bow of
      copper&quot; (or &quot;brass,&quot; as in the R.V.). The
      vessels of &quot;fine copper&quot; of Ezra 8:27 were
      probably similar to those of &quot;bright brass&quot;
      mentioned in 1 Kings 7:45; Dan. 10:6.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tubal-cain was the first artificer in brass and iron (Gen.
      4:22). Hiram was noted as a worker in brass (1 Kings 7:14).
      Copper abounded in Palestine (Deut. 8:9; Isa. 60:17; 1 Chr.
      22:3, 14). All sorts of vessels in the tabernacle and the
      temple were made of it (Lev. 6:28; Num. 16:39; 2 Chr. 4:16;
      Ezra 8:27); also weapons of war (1 Sam. 17:5, 6, 38; 2 Sam.
      21:16). Iron is mentioned only four times (Gen. 4:22; Lev.
      26:19; Num. 31:22; 35:16) in the first four books of Moses,
      while copper (rendered &quot;brass&quot;) is mentioned
      forty times. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000895"><b>Cor -</b> This Hebrew word,
      untranslated, denotes a round vessel used as a measure both
      for liquids and solids. It was equal to one homer, and
      contained ten ephahs in dry and ten baths in liquid measure
      (Ezek. 45:14). The Rabbins estimated the cor at forty-five
      gallons, while Josephus estimated it at about eighty-seven.
      In 1 Kings 4:22; 5:11; 2 Chr. 2:10; 27:5, the original word
      is rendered &quot;measure.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000896"><b>Coral -</b> Heb. ramoth, meaning
      &quot;heights;&quot; i.e., &quot;high-priced&quot; or
      valuable things, or, as some suppose, &quot;that which
      grows high,&quot; like a tree (Job 28:18; Ezek. 27:16),
      according to the Rabbins, red coral, which was in use for
      ornaments.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The coral is a cretaceous marine product, the deposit by
      minute polypous animals of calcareous matter in cells in
      which the animal lives. It is of numberless shapes as it
      grows, but usually is branched like a tree. Great coral
      reefs and coral islands abound in the Red Sea, whence
      probably the Hebrews derived their knowledge of it. It is
      found of different colours, white, black, and red. The red,
      being esteemed the most precious, was used, as noticed
      above, for ornamental purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000897"><b>Corban -</b> a Hebrew word adopted
      into the Greek of the New Testament and left untranslated.
      It occurs only once (Mark 7:11). It means a gift or
      offering consecrated to God. Anything over which this word
      was once pronounced was irrevocably dedicated to the
      temple. Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed
      before the year of jubilee (Lev. 27:16-24). Our Lord
      condemns the Pharisees for their false doctrine, inasmuch
      as by their traditions they had destroyed the commandment
      which requires children to honour their father and mother,
      teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by
      the device of pronouncing &quot;Corban&quot; over their
      goods, thus reserving them to their own selfish use.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000898"><b>Cord -</b> frequently used in its
      proper sense, for fastening a tent (Ex. 35:18; 39:40),
      yoking animals to a cart (Isa. 5:18), binding prisoners
      (Judg. 15:13; Ps. 2:3; 129:4), and measuring ground (2 Sam.
      8;2; Ps. 78:55). Figuratively, death is spoken of as the
      giving way of the tent-cord (Job 4:21. &quot;Is not their
      tent-cord plucked up?&quot; R.V.). To gird one&#39;s self
      with a cord was a token of sorrow and humiliation. To
      stretch a line over a city meant to level it with the
      ground (Lam. 2:8). The &quot;cords of sin&quot; are the
      consequences or fruits of sin (Prov. 5:22). A
      &quot;threefold cord&quot; is a symbol of union (Eccl.
      4:12). The &quot;cords of a man&quot; (Hos. 11:4) means
      that men employ, in inducing each other, methods such as
      are suitable to men, and not &quot;cords&quot; such as oxen
      are led by. Isaiah (5:18) says, &quot;Woe unto them that
      draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with
      a cart rope.&quot; This verse is thus given in the Chaldee
      paraphrase: &quot;Woe to those who begin to sin by little
      and little, drawing sin by cords of vanity: these sins grow
      and increase till they are strong and are like a cart
      rope.&quot; This may be the true meaning. The wicked at
      first draw sin with a slender cord; but by-and-by their
      sins increase, and they are drawn after them by a cart
      rope. Henderson in his commentary says: &quot;The meaning
      is that the persons described were not satisfied with
      ordinary modes of provoking the Deity, and the consequent
      ordinary approach of his vengeance, but, as it were, yoked
      themselves in the harness of iniquity, and, putting forth
      all their strength, drew down upon themselves, with
      accelerated speed, the load of punishment which their sins
      deserved.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0000899"><b>Coriander -</b> Heb. gad, (Ex. 16:31;
      Num. 11:7), seed to which the manna is likened in its form
      and colour. It is the Coriandrum sativum of botanists, an
      umbelliferous annual plant with a round stalk, about two
      feet high. It is widely cultivated in Eastern countries and
      in the south of Europe for the sake of its seeds, which are
      in the form of a little ball of the size of a peppercorn.
      They are used medicinally and as a spice. The Greek name of
      this plant is korion or koriannon, whence the name
      &quot;coriander.&quot; </a>
