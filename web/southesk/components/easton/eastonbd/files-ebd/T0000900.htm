      <a name="T0000900"><b>Corinth -</b> a Grecian city, on the
      isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of
      Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient
      city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that
      mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having
      been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a
      colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans
      the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia (Acts
      18:12-16). It was noted for its wealth, and for the
      luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It
      had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews.
      When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio,
      the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for
      eighteen months (18:1-18). Here he first became aquainted
      with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure
      Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he
      visited it a second time, and remained for three months
      (20:3). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans
      was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many
      Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element
      prevailed in the church there.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have argued from 2 Cor. 12:14; 13:1, that Paul visited
      Corinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded
      occasion he visited the city between what are usually
      called the first and second visits). But the passages
      referred to only indicate Paul&#39;s intention to visit
      Corinth (comp. 1 Cor. 16:5, where the Greek present tense
      denotes an intention), an intention which was in some way
      frustrated. We can hardly suppose that such a visit could
      have been made by the apostle without more distinct
      reference to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000901"><b>Corinthians, First Epistle to the -</b> was written from Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:8) about the time
      of the Passover in the third year of the apostle&#39;s
      sojourn there (Acts 19:10; 20:31), and when he had formed
      the purpose to visit Macedonia, and then return to Corinth
      (probably A.D. 57).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The news which had reached him, however, from Corinth
      frustrated his plan. He had heard of the abuses and
      contentions that had arisen among them, first from Apollos
      (Acts 19:1), and then from a letter they had written him on
      the subject, and also from some of the &quot;household of
      Chloe,&quot; and from Stephanas and his two friends who had
      visited him (1 Cor. 1:11; 16:17). Paul thereupon wrote this
      letter, for the purpose of checking the factious spirit and
      correcting the erroneous opinions that had sprung up among
      them, and remedying the many abuses and disorderly
      practices that prevailed. Titus and a brother whose name is
      not given were probably the bearers of the letter (2 Cor.
      2:13; 8:6, 16-18).
    </p>
    <p>
      The epistle may be divided into four parts:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The apostle deals with the subject of the lamentable
      divisions and party strifes that had arisen among them (1
      Cor. 1-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) He next treats of certain cases of immorality that had
      become notorious among them. They had apparently set at
      nought the very first principles of morality (5; 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In the third part he discusses various questions of
      doctrine and of Christian ethics in reply to certain
      communications they had made to him. He especially
      rectifies certain flagrant abuses regarding the celebration
      of the Lord&#39;s supper (7-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The concluding part (15; 16) contains an elaborate
      defense of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead,
      which had been called in question by some among them,
      followed by some general instructions, intimations, and
      greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      This epistle &quot;shows the powerful self-control of the
      apostle in spite of his physical weakness, his distressed
      circumstances, his incessant troubles, and his emotional
      nature. It was written, he tells us, in bitter anguish,
      &#39;out of much affliction and pressure of heart...and
      with streaming eyes&#39; (2 Cor. 2:4); yet he restrained
      the expression of his feelings, and wrote with a dignity
      and holy calm which he thought most calculated to win back
      his erring children. It gives a vivid picture of the early
      church...It entirely dissipates the dream that the
      apostolic church was in an exceptional condition of
      holiness of life or purity of doctrine.&quot; The apostle
      in this epistle unfolds and applies great principles fitted
      to guide the church of all ages in dealing with the same
      and kindred evils in whatever form they may appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the epistles the authenticity of which has
      never been called in question by critics of any school, so
      many and so conclusive are the evidences of its Pauline
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subscription to this epistle states erroneously in the
      Authorized Version that it was written at Philippi. This
      error arose from a mistranslation of 1 Cor. 16:5, &quot;For
      I do pass through Macedonia,&quot; which was interpreted as
      meaning, &quot;I am passing through Macedonia.&quot; In
      16:8 he declares his intention of remaining some time
      longer in Ephesus. After that, his purpose is to &quot;pass
      through Macedonia.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000902"><b>Corinthians, Second Epistle to the -</b> Shortly after writing his first letter to the
      Corinthians, Paul left Ephesus, where intense excitement
      had been aroused against him, the evidence of his great
      success, and proceeded to Macedonia. Pursuing the usual
      route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe.
      Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from
      Ephesus to Corinth, with tidings of the effects produced on
      the church there by the first epistle; but was disappointed
      (1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 1:8; 2:12, 13). He then left Troas and
      proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried,
      he was soon joined by Titus (2 Cor. 7:6, 7), who brought
      him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the
      influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the
      favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth,
      this second epistle was written. It was probably written at
      Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the
      year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This letter
      he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also to
      the saints in all Achaia, i.e., in Athens, Cenchrea, and
      other cities in Greece.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of this epistle may be thus arranged:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Paul speaks of his spiritual labours and course of
      life, and expresses his warm affection toward the
      Corinthians (2 Cor. 1-7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) He gives specific directions regarding the collection
      that was to be made for their poor brethren in Judea (8;
      9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) He defends his own apostolic claim (10-13), and
      justifies himself from the charges and insinuations of the
      false teacher and his adherents.
    </p>
    <p>
      This epistle, it has been well said, shows the
      individuallity of the apostle more than any other.
      &quot;Human weakness, spiritual strength, the deepest
      tenderness of affection, wounded feeling, sternness, irony,
      rebuke, impassioned self-vindication, humility, a just
      self-respect, zeal for the welfare of the weak and
      suffering, as well as for the progress of the church of
      Christ and for the spiritual advancement of its members,
      are all displayed in turn in the course of his
      appeal.&quot;--Lias, Second Corinthians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the effects produced on the Corinthian church by this
      epistle we have no definite information. We know that Paul
      visited Corinth after he had written it (Acts 20:2, 3), and
      that on that occasion he tarried there for three months. In
      his letter to Rome, written at this time, he sent
      salutations from some of the principal members of the
      church to the Romans.

      <a name="T0000903"><b>Cormorant -</b> (Lev. 11:17; Deut.
      14:17), Heb. shalak, &quot;plunging,&quot; or &quot;darting
      down,&quot; (the Phalacrocorax carbo), ranked among the
      &quot;unclean&quot; birds; of the same family group as the
      pelican. It is a &quot;plunging&quot; bird, and is common
      on the coasts and the island seas of Palestine. Some think
      the Hebrew word should be rendered &quot;gannet&quot; (Sula
      bassana, &quot;the solan goose&quot;); others that it is
      the &quot;tern&quot; or &quot;sea swallow,&quot; which also
      frequents the coasts of Palestine as well as the Sea of
      Galilee and the Jordan valley during several months of the
      year. But there is no reason to depart from the ordinary
      rendering.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Isa. 34:11, Zeph. 2:14 (but in R.V.,
      &quot;pelican&quot;) the Hebrew word rendered by this name
      is <i>ka&#39;ath</i>. It is translated &quot;pelican&quot;
      (q.v.) in Ps. 102:6. The word literally means the
      &quot;vomiter,&quot; and the pelican is so called from its
      vomiting the shells and other things which it has
      voraciously swallowed. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0000904"><b>Corn -</b> The word so rendered
      (dagan) in Gen. 27:28, 37, Num. 18:27, Deut. 28:51, Lam.
      2:12, is a general term representing all the commodities we
      usually describe by the words corn, grain, seeds, peas,
      beans. With this corresponds the use of the word in John
      12:24.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gen. 41:35, 49, Prov. 11:26, Joel 2:24
      (&quot;wheat&quot;), the word thus translated (bar; i.e.,
      &quot;winnowed&quot;) means corn purified from chaff. With
      this corresponds the use of the word in the New Testament
      (Matt. 3:12; Luke 3:17; Acts 7:12). In Ps. 65:13 it means
      &quot;growing corn.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gen. 42:1, 2, 19, Josh. 9:14, Neh. 10:31
      (&quot;victuals&quot;), the word (sheber; i.e.,
      &quot;broken,&quot; i.e., grist) denotes generally
      victuals, provisions, and corn as a principal article of
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of Solomon, corn began to be exported from
      Palestine (Ezek. 27:17; Amos 8:5). &quot;Plenty of
      corn&quot; was a part of Issac&#39;s blessing conferred
      upon Jacob (Gen. 27:28; comp. Ps. 65:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000905"><b>Cornelius -</b> a centurion whose
      history is narrated in Acts 10. He was a &quot;devout
      man,&quot; and like the centurion of Capernaum, believed in
      the God of Israel. His residence at Caesrea probably
      brought him into contact with Jews who communicated to him
      their expectations regarding the Messiah; and thus he was
      prepared to welcome the message Peter brought him. He
      became the first fruit of the Gentile world to Christ. He
      and his family were baptized and admitted into the
      Christian church (Acts 10:1, 44-48). (See <a href=

      CENTURION</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000906"><b>Corner -</b> The angle of a house
      (Job 1:19) or a street (Prov. 7:8). &quot;Corners&quot; in
      Neh. 9:22 denotes the various districts of the promised
      land allotted to the Israelites. In Num. 24:17, the
      &quot;corners of Moab&quot; denotes the whole land of Moab.
      The &quot;corner of a field&quot; (Lev. 19:9; 23:22) is its
      extreme part, which was not to be reaped. The Jews were
      prohibited from cutting the &quot;corners,&quot; i.e., the
      extremities, of the hair and whiskers running round the
      ears (Lev. 19:27; 21:5). The &quot;four corners of the
      earth&quot; in Isa. 11:12 and Ezek. 7:2 denotes the whole
      land. The &quot;corners of the streets&quot; mentioned in
      Matt. 6:5 means the angles where streets meet so as to form
      a square or place of public resort.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The corner gate of Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chr. 26:9)
      was on the north-west side of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corner-stone (Job 38:6; Isa. 28:16), a block of great
      importance in binding together the sides of a building. The
      &quot;head of the corner&quot; (Ps. 118:22, 23) denotes the
      coping, the &quot;coign of vantage&quot;, i.e., the
      topstone of a building. But the word &quot;corner
      stone&quot; is sometimes used to denote some person of rank
      and importance (Isa. 28:16). It is applied to our Lord, who
      was set in highest honour (Matt. 21:42). He is also styled
      &quot;the chief corner stone&quot; (Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet.
      2:6-8). When Zechariah (10:4), speaking of Judah, says,
      &quot;Out of him came forth the corner,&quot; he is
      probably to be understood as ultimately referring to the
      Messiah as the &quot;corner stone.&quot; (See TEMPLE,
      SOLOMON&#39;S &macr;T0003612.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000907"><b>Cornet -</b> Heb. shophar,
      &quot;brightness,&quot; with reference to the clearness of
      its sound (1 Chr. 15:28; 2 Chr. 15:14; Ps. 98:6; Hos. 5:8).
      It is usually rendered in the Authorized Version
      &quot;trumpet.&quot; It denotes the long and straight horn,
      about eighteen inches long. The words of Joel, &quot;Blow
      the trumpet,&quot; literally, &quot;Sound the cornet,&quot;
      refer to the festival which was the preparation for the day
      of Atonement. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word (keren) so
      rendered is a curved horn. The word &quot;cornet&quot; in 2
      Sam. 6:5 (Heb. mena&#39;an&#39;im, occurring only here) was
      some kind of instrument played by being shaken like the
      Egyptian sistrum, consisting of rings or bells hung loosely
      on iron rods.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0000909"><b>Cottage -</b> (1.) A booth in a
      vineyard (Isa. 1:8); a temporary shed covered with leaves
      or straw to shelter the watchman that kept the garden.
      These were slight fabrics, and were removed when no longer
      needed, or were left to be blown down in winter (Job
      27:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A lodging-place (rendered &quot;lodge&quot; in Isa.
      1:8); a slighter structure than the &quot;booth,&quot; as
      the cucumber patch is more temporary than a vineyard (Isa.
      24:20). It denotes a frail structure of boughs supported on
      a few poles, which is still in use in the East, or a
      hammock suspended between trees, in which the watchman was
      accustomed to sleep during summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In Zeph. 2:6 it is the rendering of the Hebrew <i>
      keroth</i>, which some suppose to denote rather
      &quot;pits&quot; (R.V. marg., &quot;caves&quot;) or
      &quot;wells of water,&quot; such as shepherds would sink.

      &quot;ploughshare&quot; (Isa. 2:4; Micah 4:3; Joel 3:10).

    <p>
      The Jewish councils were the Sanhedrim, or supreme council
      of the nation, which had subordinate to it smaller
      tribunals (the &quot;judgment,&quot; perhaps, in Matt.
      5:21, 22) in the cities of Palestine (Matt. 10:17; Mark
      13:9). In the time of Christ the functions of the Sanhedrim
      were limited (John 16:2; 2 Cor. 11:24). In Ps. 68:27 the
      word &quot;council&quot; means simply a company of persons.
      (R.V. marg., &quot;company.&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      In ecclesiastical history the word is used to denote an
      assembly of pastors or bishops for the discussion and
      regulation of church affairs. The first of these councils
      was that of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, of which
      we have a detailed account in Acts 15.

      11:14; 15:22), a king&#39;s state counsellor (2 Sam.
      15:12). Used once of the Messiah (Isa. 9:6). In Mark 15:43,
      Luke 23:50, the word probably means a member of the Jewish
      Sanhedrim.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000914"><b>Courses -</b> When David was not
      permitted to build the temple, he proceeded, among the last
      acts of his life, with the assistance of Zadok and
      Ahimelech, to organize the priestly and musical services to
      be conducted in the house of God. (1.) He divided the
      priests into twenty-four courses (1 Chr. 24:1-19), sixteen
      being of the house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar.
      Each course was under a head or chief, and ministered for a
      week, the order being determined by lot. (2.) The rest of
      the 38,000 Levites (23:4) were divided also into
      twenty-four courses, each to render some allotted service
      in public worship: 4,000 in twenty-four courses were set
      apart as singers and musicians under separate leaders (25);
      4,000 as porters or keepers of the doors and gates of the
      sanctuary (26:1-19); and 6,000 as officers and judges to
      see to the administration of the law in all civil and
      ecclesiastical matters (20-32).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement was re-established by Hezekiah (2 Chr.
      31:2); and afterwards the four sacerdotal courses which are
      said to have returned from the Captivity were re-divided
      into the original number of twenty-four by Ezra (6:18).

      <a name="T0000915"><b>Court -</b> the enclosure of the
      tabernacle (Ex. 27:9-19; 40:8), of the temple (1 Kings
      6:36), of a prison (Neh. 3:25), of a private house (2 Sam.
      17:18), and of a king&#39;s palace (2 Kings 20:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000916"><b>Covenant -</b> a contract or
      agreement between two parties. In the Old Testament the
      Hebrew word <i>berith</i> is always thus translated. <i>
      Berith</i> is derived from a root which means &quot;to
      cut,&quot; and hence a covenant is a &quot;cutting,&quot;
      with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into
      two parts, and the contracting parties passing between
      them, in making a covenant (Gen. 15; Jer. 34:18, 19).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is <i>
      diatheke</i>, which is, however, rendered
      &quot;testament&quot; generally in the Authorized Version.
      It ought to be rendered, just as the word <i>berith</i> of
      the Old Testament, &quot;covenant.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man
      and man (Gen. 21:32), or between tribes or nations (1 Sam.
      11:1; Josh. 9:6, 15). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah
      was solemnly called on to witness the transaction (Gen.
      31:50), and hence it was called a &quot;covenant of the
      Lord&quot; (1 Sam. 20:8). The marriage compact is called
      &quot;the covenant of God&quot; (Prov. 2:17), because the
      marriage was made in God&#39;s name. Wicked men are spoken
      of as acting as if they had made a &quot;covenant with
      death&quot; not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour
      them (Isa. 28:15, 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The word is used with reference to God&#39;s
      revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to
      men. Thus God&#39;s promise to Noah after the Flood is
      called a covenant (Gen. 9; Jer. 33:20, &quot;my
      covenant&quot;). We have an account of God&#39;s covernant
      with Abraham (Gen. 17, comp. Lev. 26:42), of the covenant
      of the priesthood (Num. 25:12, 13; Deut. 33:9; Neh. 13:29),
      and of the covenant of Sinai (Ex. 34:27, 28; Lev. 26:15),
      which was afterwards renewed at different times in the
      history of Israel (Deut. 29; Josh. 1:24; 2 Chr. 15; 23; 29;
      34; Ezra 10; Neh. 9). In conformity with human custom,
      God&#39;s covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath
      (Deut. 4:31; Ps. 89:3), and to be accompanied by a sign
      (Gen. 9; 17). Hence the covenant is called God&#39;s
      &quot;counsel,&quot; &quot;oath,&quot; &quot;promise&quot;
      (Ps. 89:3, 4; 105:8-11; Heb. 6:13-20; Luke 1:68-75).
      God&#39;s covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of
      blessing (Isa. 59:21; Jer. 31:33, 34).
    </p>
    <p>
      The term covenant is also used to designate the regular
      succession of day and night (Jer. 33:20), the Sabbath (Ex.
      31:16), circumcision (Gen. 17:9, 10), and in general any
      ordinance of God (Jer. 34:13, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      A &quot;covenant of salt&quot; signifies an everlasting
      covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an
      emblem of perpetuity, is used (Num. 18:19; Lev. 2:13; 2
      Chr. 13:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was
      placed at his creation. In this covenant, (1.) The
      contracting parties were (a) God the moral Governor, and
      (b) Adam, a free moral agent, and representative of all his
      natural posterity (Rom. 5:12-19). (2.) The promise was
      &quot;life&quot; (Matt. 19:16, 17; Gal. 3:12). (3.) The
      condition was perfect obedience to the law, the test in
      this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the
      &quot;tree of knowledge,&quot; etc. (4.) The penalty was
      death (Gen. 2:16, 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made
      with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of
      life, because &quot;life&quot; was the promise attached to
      obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded
      perfect obedience to the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;tree of life&quot; was the outward sign and seal
      of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence
      it is usually called the seal of that covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as
      Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his
      people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith.
      It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable
      justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to
      Christ and accepted his righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered
      into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out
      by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented
      the Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his
      people as their surety (John 17:4, 6, 9; Isa. 42:6; Ps.
      89:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions of this covenant were, (1.) On the part of
      the Father (a) all needful preparation to the Son for the
      accomplishment of his work (Heb. 10:5; Isa. 42:1-7); (b)
      support in the work (Luke 22:43); and (c) a glorious reward
      in the exaltation of Christ when his work was done (Phil.
      2:6-11), his investiture with universal dominion (John
      5:22; Ps. 110:1), his having the administration of the
      covenant committed into his hands (Matt. 28:18; John 1:12;
      17:2; Acts 2:33), and in the final salvation of all his
      people (Isa. 35:10; 53:10, 11; Jer. 31:33; Titus 1:2). (2.)
      On the part of the Son the conditions were (a) his becoming
      incarnate (Gal. 4:4, 5); and (b) as the second Adam his
      representing all his people, assuming their place and
      undertaking all their obligations under the violated
      covenant of works; (c) obeying the law (Ps. 40:8; Isa.
      42:21; John 9:4, 5), and (d) suffering its penalty (Isa.
      53; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13), in their stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ, the mediator of, fulfils all its conditions in
      behalf of his people, and dispenses to them all its
      blessings. In Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24, this title is given to
      Christ. (See <a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000917"><b>Covering of the eyes -</b> occurs
      only in Gen. 20:16. In the Revised Version the rendering is
      &quot;it (i.e., Abimelech&#39;s present of 1,000 pieces of
      silver to Abraham) is for thee a covering of the
      eyes.&quot; This has been regarded as an implied advice to
      Sarah to conform to the custom of married women, and wear a
      complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the
      face.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000918"><b>Covetousness -</b> a strong desire
      after the possession of worldly things (Col. 3:5; Eph. 5:5;
      Heb. 13:5; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10; Matt. 6:20). It assumes
      sometimes the more aggravated form of avarice, which is the
      mark of cold-hearted worldliness.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000919"><b>Cow -</b> A cow and her calf were not
      to be killed on the same day (Lev. 22:28; Ex. 23:19; Deut.
      22:6, 7). The reason for this enactment is not given. A
      state of great poverty is described in the words of Isa.
      7:21-25, where, instead of possessing great resources, a
      man shall depend for the subsistence of himself and his
      family on what a single cow and two sheep could yield.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000920"><b>Crane -</b> (Isa. 38:14; Jer. 8:7).
      In both of these passages the Authorized Version has
      reversed the Hebrew order of the words. &quot;Crane or
      swallow&quot; should be &quot;swallow or crane,&quot; as in
      the Revised Version. The rendering is there correct. The
      Hebrew for crane is <i>&#39;agur</i>, the Grus cincerea, a
      bird well known in Palestine. It is migratory, and is
      distinguished by its loud voice, its cry being hoarse and
      melancholy.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000921"><b>Creation -</b> &quot;In the
      beginning&quot; God created, i.e., called into being, all
      things out of nothing. This creative act on the part of God
      was absolutely free, and for infinitely wise reasons. The
      cause of all things exists only in the will of God. The
      work of creation is attributed (1) to the Godhead (Gen.
      1:1, 26); (2) to the Father (1 Cor. 8:6); (3) to the Son
      (John 1:3; Col. 1:16, 17); (4) to the Holy Spirit (Gen.
      1:2; Job 26:13; Ps. 104:30). The fact that he is the
      Creator distinguishes Jehovah as the true God (Isa. 37:16;
      40:12, 13; 54:5; Ps. 96:5; Jer. 10:11, 12). The one great
      end in the work of creation is the manifestation of the
      glory of the Creator (Col. 1:16; Rev. 4:11; Rom. 11:36).
      God&#39;s works, equally with God&#39;s word, are a
      revelation from him; and between the teachings of the one
      and those of the other, when rightly understood, there can
      be no contradiction.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditions of the creation, disfigured by corruptions, are
      found among the records of ancient Eastern nations. (See <a

      ACCAD</a>.) A peculiar interest belongs to the traditions
      of the Accadians, the primitive inhabitants of the plains
      of Lower Mesopotamia. These within the last few years have
      been brought to light in the tablets and cylinders which
      have been rescued from the long-buried palaces and temples
      of Assyria. They bear a remarkable resemblance to the
      record of Genesis.

      long and 35 broad. It was at one time a very prosperous and
      populous island, having a &quot;hundred cities.&quot; The
      character of the people is described in Paul&#39;s
      quotation from &quot;one of their own poets&quot;
      (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: &quot;The Cretans are
      alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies&quot; (Titus 1:12).
      Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost
      (Acts 2:11). The island was visited by Paul on his voyage
      to Rome (Acts 27). Here Paul subsequently left Titus (1:5)
      &quot;to ordain elders.&quot; Some have supposed that it

      The forms in which the cross is represented are these:

    <p>
      After the conversion, so-called, of Constantine the Great
      (B.C. 313), the cross first came into use as an emblem of
      Christianity. He pretended at a critical moment that he saw
      a flaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription,
      &quot;In hoc signo vinces&quot;, i.e., By this sign thou
      shalt conquer, and that on the following night Christ
      himself appeared and ordered him to take for his standard
      the sign of this cross. In this form a new standard, called
      the Labarum, was accordingly made, and borne by the Roman
      armies. It remained the standard of the Roman army till the
      downfall of the Western empire. It bore the embroidered
      monogram of Christ, i.e., the first two Greek letters of
      his name, X and P (chi and rho), with the Alpha and Omega.

      <a name="T0000929"><b>Crown -</b> (1.) Denotes the plate of
      gold in the front of the high priest&#39;s mitre (Ex. 29:6;
      39:30). The same Hebrew word so rendered (ne&#39;zer)
      denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle (2 Sam. 1:10),
      and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash (2
      Kings 11:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is <i>
      &#39;atarah</i>, meaning a &quot;circlet.&quot; This is
      used of crowns and head ornaments of divers kinds,
      including royal crowns. Such was the crown taken from the
      king of Ammon by David (2 Sam. 12:30). The crown worn by
      the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned with
      flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crowns
      worn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a
      diadem surrounded the royal head-dress of two or three
      fillets. This probably signified that the wearer had
      dominion over two or three countries. In Rev. 12:3; 13:1,
      we read of &quot;many crowns,&quot; a token of extended
      dominion.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The ancient Persian crown (Esther 1:11; 2:17; 6:8) was
      called <i>kether</i>; i.e., &quot;a chaplet,&quot; a high
      cap or tiara. Crowns were worn sometimes to represent
      honour and power (Ezek. 23:42). They were worn at marriages
      (Cant. 3:11; Isa. 61:10, &quot;ornaments;&quot; R.V.,
      &quot;a garland&quot;), and at feasts and public festivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of
      victory and reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors
      in the Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive;
      in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of
      parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans
      bestowed the &quot;civic crown&quot; on him who saved the
      life of a citizen. It was made of the leaves of the oak. In
      opposition to all these fading crowns the apostles speak of
      the incorruptible crown, the crown of life (James 1:12;
      Rev. 2:10) &quot;that fadeth not away&quot; (1 Pet. 5:4,
      Gr. amarantinos; comp. 1:4). Probably the word
      &quot;amaranth&quot; was applied to flowers we call
      &quot;everlasting,&quot; the &quot;immortal amaranth.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0000930"><b>Crown of thorns -</b> our Lord was
      crowned with a, in mockery by the Romans (Matt. 27:29). The
      object of Pilate&#39;s guard in doing this was probably to
      insult, and not specially to inflict pain. There is nothing
      to show that the shrub thus used was, as has been supposed,
      the spina Christi, which could have been easily woven into
      a wreath. It was probably the thorny nabk, which grew
      abundantly round about Jerusalem, and whose flexible,
      pliant, and round branches could easily be platted into the
      form of a crown. (See THORN &macr;T0003642, 3.)</a>

      <a name="T0000931"><b>Crucifixion -</b> a common mode of
      punishment among heathen nations in early times. It is not
      certain whether it was known among the ancient Jews;
      probably it was not. The modes of capital punishment
      according to the Mosaic law were, by the sword (Ex. 21),
      strangling, fire (Lev. 20), and stoning (Deut. 21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was regarded as the most horrible form of death, and
      to a Jew it would acquire greater horror from the curse in
      Deut. 21:23.
    </p>
    <p>
      This punishment began by subjecting the sufferer to
      scourging. In the case of our Lord, however, his scourging
      was rather before the sentence was passed upon him, and was
      inflicted by Pilate for the purpose, probably, of exciting
      pity and procuring his escape from further punishment (Luke
      23:22; John 19:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The condemned one carried his own cross to the place of
      execution, which was outside the city, in some conspicuous
      place set apart for the purpose. Before the nailing to the
      cross took place, a medicated cup of vinegar mixed with
      gall and myrrh (the sopor) was given, for the purpose of
      deadening the pangs of the sufferer. Our Lord refused this
      cup, that his senses might be clear (Matt. 27:34). The
      spongeful of vinegar, sour wine, posca, the common drink of
      the Roman soldiers, which was put on a hyssop stalk and
      offered to our Lord in contemptuous pity (Matt. 27:48; Luke
      23:36), he tasted to allay the agonies of his thirst (John
      19:29). The accounts given of the crucifixion of our Lord
      are in entire agreement with the customs and practices of
      the Roman in such cases. He was crucified between two
      &quot;malefactors&quot; (Isa. 53:12; Luke 23:32), and was
      watched by a party of four soldiers (John 19:23; Matt.
      27:36, 54), with their centurion. The &quot;breaking of the
      legs&quot; of the malefactors was intended to hasten death,
      and put them out of misery (John 19:31); but the unusual
      rapidity of our Lord&#39;s death (19:33) was due to his
      previous sufferings and his great mental anguish. The
      omission of the breaking of his legs was the fulfilment of
      a type (Ex. 12:46). He literally died of a broken heart, a
      ruptured heart, and hence the flowing of blood and water
      from the wound made by the soldier&#39;s spear (John
      19:34). Our Lord uttered seven memorable words from the
      cross, namely, (1) Luke 23:34; (2) 23:43; (3) John 19:26;
      (4) Matt. 27:46, Mark 15:34; (5) John 19:28; (6) 19:30; (7)

      derived from the Latin cubitus, the lower arm. It is
      difficult to determine the exact length of this measure,
      from the uncertainty whether it included the entire length
      from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger, or only
      from the elbow to the root of the hand at the wrist. The
      probability is that the longer was the original cubit. The
      common computation as to the length of the cubit makes it
      20.24 inches for the ordinary cubit, and 21.888 inches for
      the sacred one. This is the same as the Egyptian
      measurements.</a>

      by &quot;petrel&quot; or &quot;shearwater&quot; (Puffinus
      cinereus), which is found on the coast of Syria; others
      think it denotes the &quot;sea-gull&quot; or
      &quot;seamew.&quot; The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus)
      feeds on reptiles and large insects. It is found in Asia
      and Africa as well as in Europe. It only passes the winter
      in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to utter the cry <i>
      Yakub_, and hence they call it _tir el-Yakub</i>; i.e.,

      extensively cultivated in the East at the present day, as
      it appears to have been in earlier times among the Hebrews.
      It belongs to the gourd family of plants. In the East its

      Egyptian monuments. All Solomon&#39;s drinking vessels were
      of gold (1 Kings 10: 21). The cups mentioned in the New

      sometimes of gold (Rev. 17:4).</a>

    <p>
      The &quot;cup of salvation&quot; (Ps. 116:13) is the cup of
      thanksgiving for the great salvation. The &quot;cup of
      consolation&quot; (Jer. 16:7) refers to the custom of
      friends sending viands and wine to console relatives in
      mourning (Prov. 31:6). In 1 Cor. 10:16, the &quot;cup of
      blessing&quot; is contrasted with the &quot;cup of
      devils&quot; (1 Cor. 10:21). The sacramental cup is the
      &quot;cup of blessing,&quot; because of blessing pronounced
      over it (Matt. 26:27; Luke 22:17). The &quot;portion of the
      cup&quot; (Ps. 11:6; 16:5) denotes one&#39;s condition of
      life, prosperous or adverse. A &quot;cup&quot; is also a
      type of sensual allurement (Jer. 51:7; Prov. 23:31; Rev.
      17:4). We read also of the &quot;cup of astonishment,&quot;
      the &quot;cup of trembling,&quot; and the &quot;cup of
      God&#39;s wrath&quot; (Ps. 75:8; Isa. 51:17; Jer. 25:15;
      Lam. 4:21; Ezek. 23:32; Rev. 16:19; comp. Matt. 26:39, 42;
      John 18:11). The cup is also the symbol of death (Matt.

      The cup-bearer of the king of Egypt is mentioned in
      connection with Joseph&#39;s history (Gen. 40:1-21; 41:9).
      Rabshakeh (q.v.) was cup-bearer in the Assyrian court (2
      Kings 18:17). Nehemiah filled this office to the king of
      Persia (Neh. 1:11). We read also of Solomon&#39;s

      Ephesus was noted for its wizard and the &quot;Ephesian
      spells;&quot; i.e., charms or scraps of parchment written
      over with certain formula, which were worn as a safeguard
      against all manner of evils. The more important and

      the serpent (Gen. 3:14), and against Cain (4:11). These
      divine maledictions carried their effect with them.
      Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy men
      (Gen. 9:25; 49:7; Deut. 27:15; Josh. 6:26). Such curses are
      not the consequence of passion or revenge, they are

      No one on pain of death shall curse father or mother (Ex.
      21:17), nor the prince of his people (22:28), nor the deaf
      (Lev. 19:14). Cursing God or blaspheming was punishable by
      death (Lev. 24:10-16). The words &quot;curse God and
      die&quot; (R.V., &quot;renounce God and die&quot;), used by
      Job&#39;s wife (Job 2:9), have been variously interpreted.
      Perhaps they simply mean that as nothing but death was
      expected, God would by this cursing at once interpose and
      destroy Job, and so put an end to his sufferings.

    <p>
      (2.) The sacred curtain, separating the holy of holies from
      the sanctuary, is designated by a different Hebrew word
      (peroketh). It is described as a &quot;veil of blue, and
      purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning
      work&quot; (Ex. 26:31; Lev. 16:2; Num. 18:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) &quot;Stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain&quot;
      (Isa. 40:22), is an expression used with reference to the
      veil or awning which Orientals spread for a screen over
      their courts in summer. According to the prophet, the
      heavens are spread over our heads as such an awning.
      Similar expressions are found in Ps. 104:2l; comp. Isa.

      <a name="T0000943"><b>Cush -</b> black. (1.) A son,
      probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod (Gen.
      10:8; 1 Chr. 1:10). From him the land of Cush seems to have
      derived its name. The question of the precise locality of
      the land of Cush has given rise to not a little
      controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the
      whole land of Cush (Gen. 2:13, R.V.). The term Cush is in
      the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south
      of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt
      (Ezek. 29:10, A.V. &quot;Ethiopia,&quot; Heb. Cush), with
      which it is generally associated (Ps. 68:31; Isa. 18:1;
      Jer. 46:9, etc.). It stands also associated with Elam (Isa.
      11:11), with Persia (Ezek. 38:5), and with the Sabeans
      (Isa. 45:14). From these facts it has been inferred that
      Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of
      the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still
      known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris.
      But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that
      there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by
      the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6)
      of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known
      to us as Nubia and Abyssinia (Isa. 18:1; Zeph. 3:10, Heb.
      Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed
      <i>Kesh</i>. The Cushites appear to have spread along
      extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the
      Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream
      of migration of Cushites &quot;from Ethiopia, properly so
      called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western
      India.&quot; The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in
      Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three
      branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from
      Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the
      Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in
      the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known
      afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions
      of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized
      the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they
      afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on
      the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a
      great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a
      Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded
      his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so
      forming the Chaldean nation.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of
      Ps. 7. &quot;Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head
      of his tribe, and had sought the friendship of David for
      the purpose of &#39;rewarding evil to him that was at peace
      with him.&#39;&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0000944"><b>Cushan -</b> probably a poetic or
      prolonged name of the land of Cush, the Arabian Cush (Hab.
      3:7). Some have, however, supposed this to be the same as
      Chushan-rishathaim (Judg. 3:8, 10), i.e., taking the latter
      part of the name as a title or local appellation, Chushan
      &quot;of the two iniquities&quot; (= oppressing Israel, and
      provoking them to idolatry), a Mesopotamian king,
      identified by Rawlinson with Asshur-ris-ilim (the father of
      Tiglathpileser I.); but incorrectly, for the empire of
      Assyria was not yet founded. He held Israel in bondage for
      eight years.</a>

      purpose, called the &quot;receipt of custom&quot; (Matt.9:
      9; Mark 2:14), where they collected the money that was to
      be paid on certain goods (Matt.17:25). These publicans were
      tempted to exact more from the people than was lawful, and
      were, in consequence of their extortions, objects of great
      hatred. The Pharisees would have no intercourse with them
      (Matt.5:46, 47; 9:10, 11).</a>

    <p>
      A tax or tribute (q.v.) of half a shekel was annually paid
      by every adult Jew for the temple. It had to be paid in
      Jewish coin (Matt. 22:17-19; Mark 12:14, 15).
      Money-changers (q.v.) were necessary, to enable the Jews
      who came up to Jerusalem at the feasts to exchange their
      foreign coin for Jewish money; but as it was forbidden by
      the law to carry on such a traffic for emolument (Deut.
      23:19, 20), our Lord drove them from the temple (Matt.
      21:12: Mark 11:15).

      &quot;hardness&quot;), mentioned only in Isa. 44:14 (R.V.,
      &quot;holm tree&quot;). The oldest Latin version translates
      this word by ilex, i.e., the evergreen oak, which may
      possibly have been the tree intended; but there is great
      probability that our Authorized Version is correct in
      rendering it &quot;cypress.&quot; This tree grows
      abundantly on the mountains of Hermon. Its wood is hard and
      fragrant, and very durable. Its foliage is dark and gloomy.
      It is an evergreen (Cupressus sempervirens).
      &quot;Throughout the East it is used as a funereal tree;
      and its dark, tall, waving plumes render it peculiarly

      islands of the Mediterranean, about 148 miles long and 40
      broad. It is distant about 60 miles from the Syrian coast.
      It was the &quot;Chittim&quot; of the Old Testament (Num.
      24:24). The Greek colonists gave it the name of Kypros,
      from the cyprus, i.e., the henna (see CAMPHIRE
      &macr;T0000701), which grew on this island. It was
      originally inhabited by Phoenicians. In B.C. 477 it fell
      under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman
      province B.C. 58. In ancient times it was a centre of great
      commercial activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced
      here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber
      and in mineral wealth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is first mentioned in the New Testament (Acts 4:36) as
      the native place of Barnabas. It was the scene of
      Paul&#39;s first missionary labours (13:4-13), when he and
      Barnabas and John Mark were sent forth by the church of
      Antioch. It was afterwards visited by Barnabas and Mark
      alone (15:39). Mnason, an &quot;old disciple,&quot; probaly
      one of the converts of the day of Pentecost belonging to
      this island, is mentioned (21:16). It is also mentioned in
      connection with the voyages of Paul (Acts 21:3; 27:4).
      After being under the Turks for three hundred years, it was
      given up to the British Government in 1878.

      Upper Libya, North Africa, founded by a colony of Greeks
      (B.C. 630). It contained latterly a large number of Jews,
      who were introduced into the city by Ptolemy, the son of
      Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to the
      security of the place. They increased in number and
      influence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent
      references to them in connection with the early history of
      Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord&#39;s cross, was a
      native of this place (Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21). Jews from
      Cyrene were in Jerusalem at Pentecost (Acts 2:10); and
      Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue at Jerusalem (6:9). Converts
      belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the
      first Gentile church at Antioch (11:20). Among &quot;the
      prophets and teachers&quot; who &quot;ministered to the

      time of our Lord&#39;s birth. Cilicia, which he ruled,
      being a province of Syria, he is called the governor, which

      celebrated &quot;King of Persia&quot; (Elam) who was
      conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation
      to the Jews (Ezra 1:1, 2). He was the son of Cambyses, the
      prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year
      B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media
      being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great
      military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell
      before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar&#39;s
      feast (Dan. 5:30), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria
      was also added to his empire (cf., &quot;Go up, O
      Elam&quot;, Isa.21:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed
      the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a &quot;shepherd&quot; (Isa.
      44:28; 45:1). God employed him in doing service to his
      ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact
      with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;first year of Cyrus&quot; (Ezra 1:1) is not the
      year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the
      Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year
      succeeding the two years during which &quot;Darius the
      Mede&quot; was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this
      time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over
      Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire.
      The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a
      great epoch in the history of the Jewish people (2 Chr.
      36:22, 23; Ezra 1:1-4; 4:3; 5:13-17; 6:3-5).
    </p>
    <p>
      This decree was discovered &quot;at Achmetha [R.V. marg.,
      &quot;Ecbatana&quot;], in the palace that is in the
      province of the Medes&quot; (Ezra 6:2). A chronicle drawn
      up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the
      history of the reign of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last
      king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire.
      In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while
      the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In
      June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis,
      and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the
      conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was
      then sent to Babylon, which surrendered &quot;without
      fighting,&quot; and the daily services in the temples
      continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself
      arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was
      communicated by Gobryas to &quot;all the province of
      Babylon,&quot; of which he had been made governor.
      Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was
      captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died,
      Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus
      now assumed the title of &quot;king of Babylon,&quot;
      claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made
      rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed
      the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia
      to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images
      of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who,
      as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of
      the temple.

      Zebulum. It is the modern small village of Deburich, at the
      base of Mount Tabor. Tradition has incorrectly made it the
      scene of the miracle of the cure of the lunatic child
      (Matt. 17:14).</a>

      <a name="T0000956"><b>Daemon -</b> the Greek form, rendered
      &quot;devil&quot; in the Authorized Version of the New

      certain power over man (James 2:19; Rev. 16:14). They
      recognize our Lord as the Son of God (Matt. 8:20; Luke
      4:41). They belong to the number of those angels that
      &quot;kept not their first estate,&quot; &quot;unclean
      spirits,&quot; &quot;fallen angels,&quot; the angels of the
      devil (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7-9). They are the

      mysteriously permitted by God to exercise an influence both
      over the souls and bodies of men, inflicting dumbness
      (Matt. 9:32), blindness (12:22), epilepsy (Mark 9:17-27),
      insanity (Matt. 8:28; Mark 5:1-5). Daemoniacs are
      frequently distinguished from those who are afflicted with
      ordinary bodily maladies (Mark 1:32; 16:17, 18; Luke 6:17,
      18). The daemons speak in their own persons (Matt. 8:29;
      Mark 1:23, 24; 5:7). This influence is clearly
      distinguished from the ordinary power of corruption and of
      temptation over men. In the daemoniac his personality seems
      to be destroyed, and his actions, words, and even thoughts
      to be overborne by the evil spirit (Mark, l.c.; Acts

      Assyrio-Babylonian deity, the worship of which was

      that Dalmanutha was near Magdala, which was probably the
      Greek name of one of the many Migdols (i.e., watch-towers)
      on the western side of the lake of Gennesaret. It has been

      Its modern name is Esh-Sham; i.e., &quot;the
      East.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of this city is said to be the most beautiful
      of all Western Asia. It is mentioned among the conquests of
      the Egyptian king Thothmes III. (B.C. 1500), and in the
      Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is first mentioned in Scripture in connection with
      Abraham&#39;s victory over the confederate kings under
      Chedorlaomer (Gen. 14:15). It was the native place of
      Abraham&#39;s steward (15:2). It is not again noticed till
      the time of David, when &quot;the Syrians of Damascus came
      to succour Hadadezer&quot; (q.v.), 2 Sam. 8:5; 1 Chr. 18:5.
      In the reign of Solomon, Rezon became leader of a band who
      revolted from Hadadezer (1 Kings 11:23), and betaking
      themselves to Damascus, settled there and made their leader
      king. There was a long war, with varying success, between
      the Israelites and Syrians, who at a later period became
      allies of Israel against Judah (2 Kings 15:37).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Syrians were at length subdued by the Assyrians, the
      city of Damascus was taken and destroyed, and the
      inhabitants carried captive into Assyria (2 Kings 16:7-9;
      comp. Isa. 7:8). In this, prophecy was fulfilled (Isa.
      17:1; Amos 1:4; Jer. 49:24). The kingdom of Syria remained
      a province of Assyria till the capture of Nineveh by the
      Medes (B.C. 625), when it fell under the conquerors. After
      passing through various vicissitudes, Syria was invaded by
      the Romans (B.C. 64), and Damascus became the seat of the
      government of the province. In A.D. 37 Aretas, the king of
      Arabia, became master of Damascus, having driven back Herod
      Antipas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This city is memorable as the scene of Saul&#39;s
      conversion (Acts 9:1-25). The street called
      &quot;Straight,&quot; in which Judas lived, in whose house
      Saul was found by Ananias, is known by the name Sultany, or
      &quot;Queen&#39;s Street.&quot; It is the principal street
      of the city. Paul visited Damascus again on his return from
      Arabia (Gal. 1:16, 17). Christianity was planted here as a
      centre (Acts 9:20), from which it spread to the surrounding
      regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In A.D. 634 Damascus was conquered by the growing
      Mohammedan power. In A.D. 1516 it fell under the dominion
      of the Turks, its present rulers. It is now the largest
      city in Asiatic Turkey. Christianity has again found a firm
      footing within its walls.

      <a name="T0000966"><b>Damnation -</b> in Rom. 13:2, means

      God, whose authority is thus resisted.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1 Cor. 11:29 (R.V., &quot;judgment&quot;) this word
      means condemnation, in the sense of exposure to severe
      temporal judgements from God, as the following verse
      explains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rom. 14:23 the word &quot;damned&quot; means
      &quot;condemned&quot; by one&#39;s own conscience, as well
      as by the Word of God. The apostle shows here that many
      things which are lawful are not expedient; and that in
      using our Christian liberty the question should not simply
      be, Is this course I follow lawful? but also, Can I follow
      it without doing injury to the spiritual interests of a
      brother in Christ? He that &quot;doubteth&quot;, i.e., is
      not clear in his conscience as to &quot;meats&quot;, will
      violate his conscience &quot;if he eat,&quot; and in eating
      is condemned; and thus one ought not so to use his liberty
      as to lead one who is &quot;weak&quot; to bring upon
      himself this condemnation.

      of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel&#39;s maid (Gen.
      30:6, &quot;God hath judged me&quot;, Heb. dananni). The
      blessing pronounced on him by his father was, &quot;Dan
      shall judge his people&quot; (49:16), probably in allusion
      to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of
      Dan.</a>
    </p>

      The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the
      wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle (Num. 2:25,
      31; 10:25). It was the last of the tribes to receive a
      portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are
      described in Josh. 19:40-48.
    </p>
    <p>
      The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of
      Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory,
      but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the
      cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its
      northern boundary. But this district was too limited.
      &quot;Squeezed into the narrow strip between the mountains
      and the sea, its energies were great beyond its
      numbers.&quot; Being pressed by the Amorites and the
      Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed
      for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies
      from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of
      the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding
      that region. &quot;Arise,&quot; they said, &quot;be not
      slothful to go, and to possess the land,&quot; for it is
      &quot;a place where there is no want of any thing that is
      in the earth&quot; (Judg. 18:10). On receiving this report,
      600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with
      them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of
      Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the
      Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the
      conquered town to Dan (Josh. 19:47). This new city of Dan
      became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as
      the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came
      to be denoted by the expression &quot;from Dan to
      Beersheba&quot;, i.e., about 144 miles.

      have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from
      which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark
      the site of the city show that it covered a considerable
      extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble

      from which various kinds of merchandise were brought to
      Tyre. Some suppose it to have been the city of Aden in

      <a name="T0000968"><b>Dance -</b> found in Judg. 21:21, 23;
      Ps. 30:11; 149:3; 150:4; Jer. 31:4, 13, etc., as the
      translation of <i>hul</i>, which points to the whirling
      motion of Oriental sacred dances. It is the rendering of a
      word (rakad&#39;) which means to skip or leap for joy, in
      Eccl. 3:4; Job 21:11; Isa. 13:21, etc.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation
      of different Greek words, circular motion (Luke 15:25);
      leaping up and down in concert (Matt. 11:17), and by a
      single person (Matt. 14:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing (Eccl. 3:4.
      Comp. Ps. 30:11; Matt. 11: 17). The Hebrews had their
      sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the
      performers were usually females (Ex. 15:20; 1 Sam. 18:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient dance was very different from that common among
      Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only
      (Ex. 15:20; Judg. 11:34; comp. 5:1). Hence the peculiarity
      of David&#39;s conduct in dancing before the ark of the
      Lord (2 Sam. 6:14). The women took part in it with their
      timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of
      Miriam and others, have herself led the female choir,
      instead of keeping aloof on the occasion and &quot;looking
      through the window.&quot; David led the choir
      &quot;uncovered&quot;, i.e., wearing only the ephod or
      linen tunic. He thought only of the honour of God, and
      forgot himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and
      festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life
      on occasions of rejoicing (Jer. 31:4). The sexes among the
      Jews always danced separately. The daughter of Herodias
      danced alone (Matt. 14:6).

    <p>
      <a name="T0000969"><b>Daniel -</b> God is my judge, or
      judge of God. (1.) David&#39;s second son, &quot;born unto
      him in Hebron, of Abigail the Carmelitess&quot; (1 Chr.
      3:1). He is called also Chileab (2 Sam. 3:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of the four great prophets, although he is not
      once spoken of in the Old Testament as a prophet. His life
      and prophecies are recorded in the Book of Daniel. He was
      descended from one of the noble families of Judah (Dan.
      1:3), and was probably born in Jerusalem about B.C. 623,
      during the reign of Josiah. At the first deportation of the
      Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (the kingdom of Israel had come to
      an end nearly a century before), or immediately after his
      victory over the Egyptians at the second battle of
      Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim
      (B.C. 606), Daniel and other three noble youths were
      carried off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels of
      the temple. There he was obliged to enter into the service
      of the king of Babylon, and in accordance with the custom
      of the age received the Chaldean name of Belteshazzar,
      i.e., &quot;prince of Bel,&quot; or &quot;Bel protect the
      king!&quot; His residence in Babylon was very probably in
      the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, now identified with a mass of
      shapeless mounds called the Kasr, on the right bank of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      His training in the schools of the wise men in Babylon
      (Dan. 1:4) was to fit him for service to the empire. He was
      distinguished during this period for his piety and his
      stict observance of the Mosaic law (1:8-16), and gained the
      confidence and esteem of those who were over him. His habit
      of attention gained during his education in Jerusalem
      enabled him soon to master the wisdom and learning of the
      Chaldeans, and even to excel his compeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of his three years of discipline and training
      in the royal schools, Daniel was distinguished for his
      proficiency in the &quot;wisdom&quot; of his day, and was
      brought out into public life. He soon became known for his
      skill in the interpretation of dreams (1:17; 2:14), and
      rose to the rank of governor of the province of Babylon,
      and became &quot;chief of the governors&quot; (Chald.
      Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known
      and also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s dream; and many
      years afterwards, when he was now an old man, amid the
      alarm and consternation of the terrible night of
      Belshazzar&#39;s impious feast, he was called in at the
      instance of the queen-mother (perhaps Nitocris, the
      daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to interpret the mysterious
      handwriting on the wall. He was rewarded with a purple robe
      and elevation to the rank of &quot;third ruler.&quot; The
      place of &quot;second ruler&quot; was held by Belshazzar as
      associated with his father, Nabonidus, on the throne
      (5:16). Daniel interpreted the handwriting, and &quot;in
      that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans
      slain.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the taking of Babylon, Cyrus, who was now master of
      all Asia from India to the Dardanelles, placed Darius
      (q.v.), a Median prince, on the throne, during the two
      years of whose reign Daniel held the office of first of the
      &quot;three presidents&quot; of the empire, and was thus
      practically at the head of affairs, no doubt interesting
      himself in the prospects of the captive Jews (Dan. 9), whom
      he had at last the happiness of seeing restored to their
      own land, although he did not return with them, but
      remained still in Babylon. His fidelity to God exposed him
      to persecution, and he was cast into a den of lions, but
      was miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a
      decree enjoining reverence for &quot;the God of
      Daniel&quot; (6:26). He &quot;prospered in the reign of
      Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian,&quot; whom
      he probably greatly influenced in the matter of the decree
      which put an end to the Captivity (B.C. 536).
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a series of prophetic visions vouch-safed to him
      which opened up the prospect of a glorious future for the
      people of God, and must have imparted peace and gladness to
      his spirit in his old age as he waited on at his post till
      the &quot;end of the days.&quot; The time and circumstances
      of his death are not recorded. He probably died at Susa,
      about eighty-five years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel, with whom he was contemporary, mentions him as a
      pattern of righteousness (14:14, 20) and wisdom (28:3).

      the Jews in that division of their Bible called the
      Hagiographa (Heb. Khethubim). (See <a href=
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000500.html&amp;from=T0000580&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      BIBLE</a>.) It consists of two distinct parts. The first
      part, consisting of the first six chapters, is chiefly
      historical; and the second part, consisting of the
      remaining six chapters, is chiefly prophetical.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The historical part of the book treats of the period of the
      Captivity. Daniel is &quot;the historian of the Captivity,
      the writer who alone furnishes any series of events for
      that dark and dismal period during which the harp of Israel
      hung on the trees that grew by the Euphrates. His narrative
      may be said in general to intervene between Kings and
      Chronicles on the one hand and Ezra on the other, or (more
      strictly) to fill out the sketch which the author of the
      Chronicles gives in a single verse in his last chapter:
      &#39;And them that had escaped from the sword carried he
      [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] away to Babylon; where they were
      servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom
      of Persia&#39;&quot; (2 Chr. 36:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The prophetical part consists of three visions and one
      lengthened prophetical communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genuineness of this book has been much disputed, but
      the arguments in its favour fully establish its claims.
      (1.) We have the testimony of Christ (Matt. 24:15; 25:31;
      26:64) and his apostles (1 Cor. 6:2; 2 Thess. 2:3) for its
      authority; and (2) the important testimony of Ezekiel
      (14:14, 20; 28:3). (3.) The character and records of the
      book are also entirely in harmony with the times and
      circumstances in which the author lived. (4.) The
      linguistic character of the book is, moreover, just such as
      might be expected. Certain portions (Dan. 2:4; 7) are
      written in the Chaldee language; and the portions written
      in Hebrew are in a style and form having a close affinity
      with the later books of the Old Testament, especially with
      that of Ezra. The writer is familiar both with the Hebrew
      and the Chaldee, passing from the one to the other just as
      his subject required. This is in strict accordance with the
      position of the author and of the people for whom his book
      was written. That Daniel is the writer of this book is also
      testified to in the book itself (7:1, 28; 8:2; 9:2; 10:1,
      2; 12:4, 5). (See <a href=

      rendering of the Hebrew darkemon and the Greek dareikos. It
      was a gold coin, bearing the figure of a Persian King with
      his crown and armed with bow and arrow. It was current
      among the Jews after their return from Babylon, i.e., while
      under the Persian domination. It weighed about 128 grains
      troy, and was of the value of about one guinea or rather
      more of our money. It is the first coin mentioned in

    <p>
      <a name="T0000975"><b>Darius -</b> the holder or supporter,
      the name of several Persian kings. (1.) Darius the Mede
      (Dan. 11:1), &quot;the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the
      Medes&quot; (9:1). On the death of Belshazzar the Chaldean
      he &quot;received the kingdom&quot; of Babylon as viceroy
      from Cyrus. During his brief reign (B.C. 538-536) Daniel
      was promoted to the highest dignity (Dan. 6:1, 2); but on
      account of the malice of his enemies he was cast into the
      den of lions. After his miraculous escape, a decree was
      issued by Darius enjoining &quot;reverence for the God of
      Daniel&quot; (6:26). This king was probably the
      &quot;Astyages&quot; of the Greek historians. Nothing can,
      however, be with certainty affirmed regarding him. Some are
      of opinion that the name &quot;Darius&quot; is simply a
      name of office, equivalent to &quot;governor,&quot; and
      that the &quot;Gobryas&quot; of the inscriptions was the
      person intended by the name.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Darius, king of Persia, was the son of Hystaspes, of
      the royal family of the Achaemenidae. He did not
      immediately succeed Cyrus on the throne. There were two
      intermediate kings, viz., Cambyses (the Ahasuerus of Ezra),
      the son of Cyrus, who reigned from B.C. 529-522, and was
      succeeded by a usurper named Smerdis, who occupied the
      throne only ten months, and was succeeded by this Darius
      (B.C. 521-486). Smerdis was a Margian, and therefore had no
      sympathy with Cyrus and Cambyses in the manner in which
      they had treated the Jews. He issued a decree prohibiting
      the restoration of the temple and of Jerusalem (Ezra
      4:17-22). But soon after his death and the accession of
      Darius, the Jews resumed their work, thinking that the
      edict of Smerdis would be now null and void, as Darius was
      in known harmony with the religious policy of Cyrus. The
      enemies of the Jews lost no time in bringing the matter
      under the notice of Darius, who caused search to be made
      for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was not found at
      Babylon, but at Achmetha (Ezra 6:2); and Darius forthwith
      issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty to
      prosecute their work, at the same time requiring the Syrian
      satrap and his subordinates to give them all needed help.
      It was with the army of this king that the Greeks fought
      the famous battle of Marathon (B.C. 490). During his reign
      the Jews enjoyed much peace and prosperity. He was
      succeeded by Ahasuerus, known to the Greeks as Xerxes, who
      reigned for twenty-one years.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Darius the Persian (Neh. 12:22) was probably the
      Darius II. (Ochus or Nothus) of profane history, the son of
      Artaxerxes Longimanus, who was the son and successor of
      Ahasuerus (Xerxes). There are some, however, who think that
      the king here meant was Darius III. (Codomannus), the
      antagonist of Alexander the Great (B.C. 336-331).

      of darkness in Egypt (Ex. 10:21) is described as darkness

      land of Egypt,&quot; so that &quot;they saw not one
      another.&quot; It did not extend to the land of Goshen
      (ver. 23).</a>

      On Mount Sinai, Moses (Ex. 20:21) &quot;drew near unto the
      thick darkness where God was.&quot; This was the
      &quot;thick cloud upon the mount&quot; in which Jehovah was
      when he spake unto Moses there. The Lord dwelt in the cloud
      upon the mercy-seat (1 Kings 8:12), the cloud of glory.
      When the psalmist (Ps. 97:2) describes the inscrutable
      nature of God&#39;s workings among the sons of men, he
      says, &quot;Clouds and darkness are round about him.&quot;
      God dwells in thick darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness (Isa. 13:9, 10; Matt. 24:29) also is a symbol of
      the judgments that attend on the coming of the Lord. It is
      a symbol of misery and adversity (Job 18:6; Ps. 107:10;
      Isa. 8:22; Ezek. 30:18). The &quot;day of darkness&quot; in
      Joel 2:2, caused by clouds of locusts, is a symbol of the
      obscurity which overhangs all divine proceedings.
      &quot;Works of darkness&quot; are impure actions (Eph.
      5:11). &quot;Outer darkness&quot; refers to the darkness of
      the streets in the East, which are never lighted up by any
      public or private lamps after nightfall, in contrast with
      the blaze of cheerful light in the house. It is also a
      symbol of ignorance (Isa. 9:2; 60:2; Matt. 6:23) and of
      death (Job 10:21; 17:13).

      that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face
      (1 Sam. 16:12; 17:42).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His early occupation was that of tending his father&#39;s
      sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his
      after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time,
      when thus engaged, with his shepherd&#39;s flute, while he
      drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes
      spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his
      encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions
      that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a
      bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to
      death in open conflict with his club (1 Sam. 17:34, 35).
    </p>
    <p>
      While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus
      engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to
      Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction
      (1 Sam. 16:1-13). There he offered up sacrifice, and called
      the elders of Israel and Jesse&#39;s family to the
      sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he
      failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for,
      and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of
      God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the
      ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly,
      in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil.
      David went back again to his shepherd life, but &quot;the
      Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day
      forward,&quot; and &quot;the Spirit of the Lord departed
      from Saul&quot; (1 Sam. 16:13, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his
      harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a
      strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so
      skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to
      entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After
      this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into
      prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel
      were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles
      south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father
      with provisions for his three brothers, who were then
      fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the
      camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was
      made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the
      Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel.
      David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a
      stone &quot;out of the brook,&quot; which struck the
      giant&#39;s forehead, so that he fell senseless to the
      ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head
      with his own sword (1 Sam. 17). The result was a great
      victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to
      the gates of Gath and Ekron.
    </p>
    <p>
      David&#39;s popularity consequent on this heroic exploit
      awakened Saul&#39;s jealousy (1 Sam. 18:6-16), which he
      showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward
      him, and by various stratagems sought his death (1 Sam.
      18-30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could
      not fail to observe that David &quot;prospered
      exceedingly,&quot; all proved futile, and only endeared the
      young hero the more to the people, and very specially to
      Jonathan, Saul&#39;s son, between whom and David a
      life-long warm friendship was formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David
      fled to Ramah (1 Sam. 19:12-18) to Samuel, who received
      him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were
      there under Samuel&#39;s training. It is supposed by some
      that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed
      by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the
      residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive
      had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back.
      Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a
      better state of mind toward David (1 Sam. 20), who, being
      made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight
      to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob
      (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city of the
      Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit
      him into his service, as he expected that he would, and
      David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of
      Adullam (22:1-4; 1 Chr. 12:8-18). Here in a short time 400
      men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their
      leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment
      and perils of his position, cried, &quot;Oh that one would
      give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;&quot;
      when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the
      Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed
      (2 Sam. 23:13-17), but which he would not drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize
      David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire
      priestly family at Nob, &quot;persons who wore a linen
      ephod&quot;, to the number of eighty-five persons, who were
      put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the
      massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of
      Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp. Ps. 52.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was
      harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it
      (1 Sam. 23:1-14); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to
      the strongholds in the &quot;hill country&quot; of Judah.
      Comp. Ps. 31. While encamped there, in the forest in the
      district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to
      him words of encouragement (23:16-18). The two now parted
      never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David,
      who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the
      crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the
      Dead Sea (1 Sam. 23:29). Here Saul, who still pursued him
      with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous
      forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what
      David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him,
      and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men,
      he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the
      district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal
      and his wife Abigail (1 Sam. 25), whom David married after
      Nabal&#39;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul again went forth (1 Sam. 26) in pursuit of David, who
      had hid himself &quot;in the hill Hachilah, which is before
      Jeshimon,&quot; in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second
      time spared through his forbearance. He returned home,
      professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had
      treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of
      moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once
      more sought refuge among the Philistines (1 Sam. 27). He
      was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his
      residence. Here David lived among his followers for some
      time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with
      the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against
      Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of
      David&#39;s loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to
      Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged
      and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the
      raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his
      return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul&#39;s death (2
      Sam. 1). An Amalekite brought Saul&#39;s crown and bracelet
      and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their
      clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in
      battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy,
      the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a
      &quot;lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son&quot;
      (2 Sam. 1:18-27). It bore the title of &quot;The Bow,&quot;
      and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of
      Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them.
      &quot;Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher&quot;
      (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for
      Hebron under divine direction (2 Sam. 2:1-4). There they
      were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as
      king. He was now about thirty years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took
      Ish-bosheth, Saul&#39;s only remaining son, over the Jordan
      to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a
      civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two
      opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the
      other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It
      resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however,
      between Israel and Judah followed (2 Sam. 3:1, 5), but
      still success was on the side of David. For the space of
      seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now
      sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement;
      but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for
      his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (3:22-39).
      This was greatly to David&#39;s regret. He mourned for the
      death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also
      treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth;
      and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over
      all Israel (4:1-12).
    </p>
    <p>
      David king over all Israel (2 Sam. 5:1-5; 1 Chr. 11:1-3).
      The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered
      allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom
      the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king
      over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government,
      more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At
      this time there was a Jebusite fortress, &quot;the
      stronghold&quot;, on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus.
      This David took from the Jebusites, and made it
      Israel&#39;s capital, and established here his residence,
      and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of
      Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time
      observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but
      were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in
      remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they
      invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He
      thus delivered Israel from their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to
      his new capital (2 Sam. 6). It was in the house of Abinadab
      at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it
      had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines
      had sent it home (1 Sam. 6; 7). In consequence of the death
      of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the
      Levites should handle the ark, Num. 4), who had put forth
      his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was
      being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the
      road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark
      into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After
      three months David brought the ark from the house of
      Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. Ps. 24. Here it was placed
      in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the
      purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood
      in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at
      Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now (1 Chr. 16)
      carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at
      Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new
      religious era began. The service of praise was for the
      first time introduced into public worship. Zion became
      henceforth &quot;God&#39;s holy hill.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      David&#39;s wars. David now entered on a series of
      conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his
      kingdom (2 Sam. 8). In a few years the whole territory from
      the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the
      west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway (2 Sam.
      8:3-13; 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      David&#39;s fall. He had now reached the height of his
      glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was
      enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of
      all this success he fell, and his character became stained
      with the sin of adultery (2 Sam. 11:2-27). It has been
      noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his
      military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad
      story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of
      warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt
      to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder.
      Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the
      Gibborim, the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order,
      &quot;set in the front of the hottest battle&quot; at the
      siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death.
      Nathan the prophet (2 Sam. 7:1-17; 12:1-23) was sent by God
      to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty
      monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed
      his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first
      Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his
      spiritual recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah&#39;s death. Her
      first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet.
      She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon,
      and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne (2 Sam.
      12:24, 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars,
      David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of
      God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution,
      because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan
      to him with a gracious message (2 Sam. 7:1-16). On
      receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the
      ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart
      in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of
      the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a
      man of peace (1 Chr. 22:9; 28:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      A cloudy evening. Hitherto David&#39;s carrer had been one
      of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days
      came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of
      Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime (2 Sam.
      13). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later
      years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime
      against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore
      trouble to David&#39;s heart. Absalom, afraid of the
      consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan,
      where he remained for three years, when he was brought back
      through the intrigue of Joab (2 Sam. 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three
      years&#39; famine (2 Sam. 21:1-14). This was soon after
      followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a
      punishment for David&#39;s sinful pride in numbering the
      people (2 Sam. 24), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished
      in the space of three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was
      sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a
      strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census,
      and the outburst of the plague in connection with it
      deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to
      manifest itself among some of the tribes against David.
      Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things,
      gradually gained over the people, and at length openly
      rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne.
      Ahithophel was Absalom&#39;s chief counsellor. The revolt
      began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there
      proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he
      left Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:13-20), and once more became a
      fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents
      of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of
      any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his
      followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural
      civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies
      were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at
      the wood of Ephraim (2 Sam. 18:1-8). Absalom&#39;s army was
      defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab
      (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son
      filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He
      &quot;went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept&quot;
      (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, &quot;Would
      God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!&quot;
      Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and
      resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose
      between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (19:41-43).
      Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel.
      He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to
      death, and so the revolt came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom
      and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of
      David&#39;s life passed away. During those years he seems
      to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures
      of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it
      was reserved to his successor to build (1 Chr. 22; 28; 29),
      a house which was to be &quot;exceeding magnifical, of fame
      and of glory throughout all countries&quot; (22:5). The
      exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers
      and trials through which he had passed, had left him an
      enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his
      life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy
      broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured
      Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the
      &quot;Fuller&#39;s spring,&quot; in the valley of Kidron,
      to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on
      the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of
      Adonijah&#39;s party failed. Solomon was brought to
      Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his
      father&#39;s throne (1 Kings 1:11-53). David&#39;s last
      words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith
      in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant
      promises (2 Sam. 23:1-7).
    </p>
    <p>
      After a reign of forty years and six months (2 Sam. 5:5; 1
      Chr. 3:4) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy
      years, &quot;and was buried in the city of David.&quot; His
      tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David
      was a type of the Messiah (1 Sam. 16:13). The book of
      Psalms commonly bears the title of the &quot;Psalms of
      David,&quot; from the circumstance that he was the largest
      contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (See

    <p>
      &quot;The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He
      had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the
      prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had
      been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy.
      The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left
      in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as
      his power went he had striven to act justly to all (2 Sam.
      8:15). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great
      sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten
      at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He
      had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a
      half at Hebron (2 Sam. 5:5). Israel at his accession had
      reached the lowest point of national depression; its
      new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by
      the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with
      dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of
      Solomon was already, before his father&#39;s death, owned
      from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the
      Orontes to the Red Sea.&quot;, Geikie&#39;s Hours etc.,

      2:4, 11), because it was David&#39;s birth-place and early
      home (1 Sam. 17:12).

      <a name="T0000984"><b>Day -</b> The Jews reckoned the day
      from sunset to sunset (Lev. 23:32). It was originally
      divided into three parts (Ps. 55:17). &quot;The heat of the
      day&quot; (1 Sam. 11:11; Neh. 7:3) was at our nine
      o&#39;clock, and &quot;the cool of the day&quot; just
      before sunset (Gen. 3:8). Before the Captivity the Jews
      divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to
      midnight (Lam. 2:19); (2) from midnight till the
      cock-crowing (Judg. 7:19); and (3) from the cock-crowing
      till sunrise (Ex. 14:24). In the New Testament the division
      of the Greeks and Romans into four watches was adopted
      (Mark 13:35). (See <a href=

      WATCHES</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The division of the day by hours is first mentioned in Dan.
      3:6, 15; 4:19; 5:5. This mode of reckoning was borrowed
      from the Chaldeans. The reckoning of twelve hours was from
      sunrise to sunset, and accordingly the hours were of
      variable length (John 11:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &quot;day&quot; sometimes signifies an indefinite
      time (Gen. 2:4; Isa. 22:5; Heb. 3:8, etc.). In Job 3:1 it
      denotes a birthday, and in Isa. 2:12, Acts 17:31, and 2
      Tim. 1:18, the great day of final judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000985"><b>Day&#39;s journey -</b> The usual
      length of a day&#39;s journey in the East, on camel or
      horseback, in six or eight hours, is about 25 or 30 miles.
      The &quot;three days&#39; journey&quot; mentioned in Ex.
      3:18 is simply a journey which would occupy three days in
      going and returning.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000986"><b>Daysman -</b> an umpire or arbiter or
      judge (Job 9:33). This word is formed from the Latin diem
      dicere, i.e., to fix a day for hearing a cause. Such an one
      is empowered by mutual consent to decide the cause, and to
      &quot;lay his hand&quot;, i.e., to impose his authority, on
      both, and enforce his sentence.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000987"><b>Dayspring -</b> (Job 38:12; Luke
      1:78), the dawn of the morning; daybreak. (Comp. Isa. 60:1,
      2; Mal. 4:2; Rev. 22:16.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000988"><b>Daystar -</b> which precedes and
      accompanies the sun-rising. It is found only in 2 Pet.
      1:19, where it denotes the manifestation of Christ to the
      soul, imparting spiritual light and comfort. He is the
      &quot;bright and morning star&quot; of Rev. 2:28; 22:16.
      (Comp. Num. 24:17.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000989"><b>Deacon -</b> Anglicized form of the
      Greek word diaconos, meaning a &quot;runner,&quot;
      &quot;messenger,&quot; &quot;servant.&quot; For a long
      period a feeling of mutual jealousy had existed between the
      &quot;Hebrews,&quot; or Jews proper, who spoke the sacred
      language of palestine, and the &quot;Hellenists,&quot; or
      Jews of the Grecian speech, who had adopted the Grecian
      language, and read the Septuagint version of the Bible
      instead of the Hebrew. This jealousy early appeared in the
      Christian community. It was alleged by the Hellenists that
      their widows were overlooked in the daily distribution of
      alms. This spirit must be checked. The apostles accordingly
      advised the disciples to look out for seven men of good
      report, full of the Holy Ghost, and men of practical
      wisdom, who should take entire charge of this distribution,
      leaving them free to devote themselves entirely to the
      spiritual functions of their office (Acts 6:1-6). This was
      accordingly done. Seven men were chosen, who appear from
      their names to have been Hellenists. The name
      &quot;deacon&quot; is nowhere applied to them in the New
      Testament; they are simply called &quot;the seven&quot;
      (21:8). Their office was at first secular, but it
      afterwards became also spiritual; for among other
      qualifications they must also be &quot;apt to teach&quot;
      (1 Tim. 3: 8-12). Both Philip and Stephen, who were of
      &quot;the seven,&quot; preached; they did &quot;the work of
      evangelists.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000990"><b>Deaconess -</b> Rom. 16:1, 3, 12;
      Phil. 4:2, 3; 1 Tim. 3:11; 5:9, 10; Titus 2:3, 4). In these
      passages it is evident that females were then engaged in
      various Christian ministrations. Pliny makes mention of
      them also in his letter to Trajan (A.D. 110).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000991"><b>Dead Sea -</b> the name given by
      Greek writers of the second century to that inland sea
      called in Scripture the &quot;salt sea&quot; (Gen. 14:3;
      Num. 34:12), the &quot;sea of the plain&quot; (Deut. 3:17),
      the &quot;east sea&quot; (Ezek. 47:18; Joel 2:20), and
      simply &quot;the sea&quot; (Ezek. 47:8). The Arabs call it
      Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a
      straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is
      1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It
      covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies
      from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have
      been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It
      is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10
      miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region
      causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth,
      notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (see JORDAN
      &macr;T0002112), is maintained with little variation. The
      Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million
      tons of water every twenty-four hours.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of
      mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary
      sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of
      magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium
      (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the
      deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake
      extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the
      watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400
      feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly
      above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much
      less salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing living can exist in this sea. &quot;The fish
      carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even
      mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no
      bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures
      on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds
      of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says
      live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and
      presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen
      species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or
      swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which
      fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty
      species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in
      England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants
      perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The
      climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is
      perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be
      established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi
      (Engedi).&quot;, Geikie&#39;s Hours, etc.

      (1 Kings 17). There were frequent dearths in Palestine. In
      the days of Abram there was a &quot;famine in the
      land&quot; (Gen. 12:10), so also in the days of Jacob
      (47:4, 13). We read also of dearths in the time of the
      judges (Ruth 1:1), and of the kings (2 Sam. 21:1; 1 Kings
      18:2; 2 Kings 4:38; 8:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In New Testament times there was an extensive famine in
      Palestine (Acts 11:28) in the fourth year of the reign of
      the emperor Claudius (A.D. 44 and 45).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0000994"><b>Death -</b> may be simply defined as
      the termination of life. It is represented under a variety
      of aspects in Scripture: (1.) &quot;The dust shall return
      to the earth as it was&quot; (Eccl. 12:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) &quot;Thou takest away their breath, they die&quot;
      (Ps. 104:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) It is the dissolution of &quot;our earthly house of
      this tabernacle&quot; (2 Cor. 5:1); the &quot;putting off
      this tabernacle&quot; (2 Pet. 1:13, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Being &quot;unclothed&quot; (2 Cor. 5:3, 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) &quot;Falling on sleep&quot; (Ps. 76:5; Jer. 51:39;
      Acts 13:36; 2 Pet. 3:9.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) &quot;I go whence I shall not return&quot; (Job
      10:21); &quot;Make me to know mine end&quot; (Ps. 39:4);
      &quot;to depart&quot; (Phil. 1:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave is represented as &quot;the gates of death&quot;
      (Job 38:17; Ps. 9:13; 107:18). The gloomy silence of the
      grave is spoken of under the figure of the &quot;shadow of
      death&quot; (Jer. 2:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Death is the effect of sin (Heb. 2:14), and not a
      &quot;debt of nature.&quot; It is but once (9:27),
      universal (Gen. 3:19), necessary (Luke 2:28-30). Jesus has
      by his own death taken away its sting for all his followers
      (1 Cor. 15:55-57).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a spiritual death in trespasses and sins, i.e.,
      the death of the soul under the power of sin (Rom. 8:6;
      Eph. 2:1, 3; Col. 2:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;second death&quot; (Rev. 2:11) is the everlasting
      perdition of the wicked (Rev. 21:8), and &quot;second&quot;
      in respect to natural or temporal death.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEATH OF CHRIST is the procuring cause incidentally of
      all the blessings men enjoy on earth. But specially it is
      the procuring cause of the actual salvation of all his
      people, together with all the means that lead thereto. It
      does not make their salvation merely possible, but certain
      (Matt. 18:11; Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 1:4; 3:13; Eph.
      1:7; 2:16; Rom. 8:32-35).

      (1.) One of the eleven cities to the west of Hebron, in the
      highlands of Judah (Josh. 15:49; Judg. 1:11-15). It was
      originally one of the towns of the Anakim (Josh. 15:15),
      and was also called Kirjath-sepher (q.v.) and
      Kirjath-sannah (49). Caleb, who had conquered and taken
      possession of the town and district of Hebron (Josh.
      14:6-15), offered the hand of his daughter to any one who
      would successfully lead a party against Debir. Othniel, his
      younger brother (Judg. 1:13; 3:9), achieved the conquest,
      and gained Achsah as his wife. She was not satisfied with
      the portion her father gave her, and as she was proceeding
      toward her new home, she &quot;lighted from off her
      ass&quot; and said to him, &quot;Give me a blessing [i.e.,
      a dowry]: for thou hast given me a south land&quot; (Josh.
      15:19, A.V.); or, as in the Revised Version, &quot;Thou
      hast set me in the land of the south&quot;, i.e., in the
      Negeb, outside the rich valley of Hebron, in the dry and
      barren land. &quot;Give me also springs of water. And he
      gave her the upper springs, and the nether
      springs.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Debir has been identified with the modern Edh-Dhaheriyeh,
      i.e., &quot;the well on the ridge&quot;, to the south of
      Hebron.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A place near the &quot;valley of Achor&quot; (Josh.
      15:7), on the north boundary of Judah, between Jerusalem
      and Jericho.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The king of Eglon, one of the five Canaanitish kings
      who were hanged by Joshua (Josh. 10:3, 23) after the
      victory at Gibeon. These kings fled and took refuge in a
      cave at Makkedah. Here they were kept confined till Joshua
      returned from the pursuit of their discomfited armies, when
      he caused them to be brought forth, and &quot;Joshua smote
      them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees&quot;
      (26).

      <a name="T0000996"><b>Deborah -</b> a bee. (1.)
      Rebekah&#39;s nurse. She accompanied her mistress when she
      left her father&#39;s house in Padan-aram to become the
      wife of Isaac (Gen. 24:59). Many years afterwards she died
      at Bethel, and was buried under the &quot;oak of
      weeping&quot;, Allon-bachuth (35:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A prophetess, &quot;wife&quot; (woman?) of Lapidoth.
      Jabin, the king of Hazor, had for twenty years held Israel
      in degrading subjection. The spirit of patriotism seemed
      crushed out of the nation. In this emergency Deborah roused
      the people from their lethargy. Her fame spread far and
      wide. She became a &quot;mother in Israel&quot; (Judg. 4:6,
      14; 5:7), and &quot;the children of Israel came up to her
      for judgment&quot; as she sat in her tent under the palm
      tree &quot;between Ramah and Bethel.&quot; Preparations
      were everywhere made by her direction for the great effort
      to throw off the yoke of bondage. She summoned Barak from
      Kadesh to take the command of 10,000 men of Zebulun and
      Naphtali, and lead them to Mount Tabor on the plain of
      Esdraelon at its north-east end. With his aid she organized
      this army. She gave the signal for attack, and the Hebrew
      host rushed down impetuously upon the army of Jabin, which
      was commanded by Sisera, and gained a great and decisive
      victory. The Canaanitish army almost wholly perished. That
      was a great and ever-memorable day in Israel. In Judg. 5 is
      given the grand triumphal ode, the &quot;song of
      Deborah,&quot; which she wrote in grateful commemoration of
      that great deliverance. (See LAPIDOTH &macr;T0002240, JABIN

      the practice of lending (Deut. 15:7; Ps. 37:26; Matt.
      5:42); but it forbade the exaction of interest except from
      foreigners. Usury was strongly condemned (Prov. 28:8; Ezek.
      18:8, 13, 17; 22:12; Ps. 15:5). On the Sabbatical year all
      pecuniary obligations were cancelled (Deut. 15:1-11). These

      to the relation between debtor and creditor are laid down
      in the Scriptures.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The debtor was to deliver up as a pledge to the
      creditor what he could most easily dispense with (Deut.
      24:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A mill, or millstone, or upper garment, when given as
      a pledge, could not be kept over night (Ex. 22:26, 27).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A debt could not be exacted during the Sabbatic year
      (Deut. 15:1-15).
    </p>
    <p>
      For other laws bearing on this relation see Lev. 25:14, 32,
      39; Matt. 18:25, 34.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A surety was liable in the same way as the original

    <p>
      <a name="T0000999"><b>Decalogue -</b> the name given by the
      Greek fathers to the ten commandments; &quot;the ten
      words,&quot; as the original is more literally rendered
      (Ex. 20:3-17). These commandments were at first written on
      two stone slabs (31:18), which were broken by Moses
      throwing them down on the ground (32:19). They were written
      by God a second time (34:1). The decalogue is alluded to in
      the New Testament five times (Matt. 5:17, 18, 19; Mark
      10:19; Luke 18:20; Rom. 7:7, 8; 13:9; 1 Tim. 1:9, 10).</a>

    <p>
      These commandments have been divided since the days of
      Origen the Greek father, as they stand in the Confession of
      all the Reformed Churches except the Lutheran. The division
      adopted by Luther, and which has ever since been received
      in the Lutheran Church, makes the first two commandments
      one, and the third the second, and so on to the last, which
      is divided into two. &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy
      neighbour&#39;s house&quot; being ranked as ninth, and
      &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#39;s wife,&quot;
      etc., the tenth. (See <a href=
