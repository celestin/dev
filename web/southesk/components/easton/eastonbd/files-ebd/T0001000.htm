      <a name="T0001000"><b>Decapolis -</b> ten cities=deka, ten,
      and polis, a city, a district on the east and south-east of
      the Sea of Galilee containing &quot;ten cities,&quot; which
      were chiefly inhabited by Greeks. It included a portion of
      Bashan and Gilead, and is mentioned three times in the New
      Testament (Matt. 4:25; Mark 5:20; 7:31). These cities were
      Scythopolis, i.e., &quot;city of the Scythians&quot;,
      (ancient Bethshean, the only one of the ten cities on the
      west of Jordan), Hippos, Gadara, Pella (to which the
      Christians fled just before the destruction of Jerusalem),
      Philadelphia (ancient Rabbath-ammon), Gerasa, Dion,
      Canatha, Raphana, and Damascus. When the Romans conquered
      Syria (B.C. 65) they rebuilt, and endowed with certain
      privileges, these &quot;ten cities,&quot; and the province
      connected with them they called &quot;Decapolis.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0001001"><b>Decision, Valley of -</b> a name
      given to the valley of Jehoshaphat (q.v.) as the vale of
      the sentence. The scene of Jehovah&#39;s signal inflictions
      on Zion&#39;s enemies (Joel 3:14; marg., &quot;valley of
      concision or threshing&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001002"><b>Decrees of God -</b> &quot;The
      decrees of God are his eternal, unchangeable, holy, wise,
      and sovereign purpose, comprehending at once all things
      that ever were or will be in their causes, conditions,
      successions, and relations, and determining their certain
      futurition. The several contents of this one eternal
      purpose are, because of the limitation of our faculties,
      necessarily conceived of by us in partial aspects, and in
      logical relations, and are therefore styled Decrees.&quot;
      The decree being the act of an infinite, absolute, eternal,
      unchangeable, and sovereign Person, comprehending a plan
      including all his works of all kinds, great and small, from
      the beginning of creation to an unending eternity; ends as
      well as means, causes as well as effects, conditions and
      instrumentalities as well as the events which depend upon
      them, must be incomprehensible by the finite intellect of
      man. The decrees are eternal (Acts 15:18; Eph. 1:4; 2
      Thess. 2:13), unchangeable (Ps. 33:11; Isa. 46:9), and
      comprehend all things that come to pass (Eph. 1:11; Matt.
      10:29, 30; Eph. 2:10; Acts 2:23; 4:27, 28; Ps. 17:13,
      14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The decrees of God are (1) efficacious, as they respect
      those events he has determined to bring about by his own
      immediate agency; or (2) permissive, as they respect those
      events he has determined that free agents shall be
      permitted by him to effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine ought to produce in our minds &quot;humility,
      in view of the infinite greatness and sovereignty of God,
      and of the dependence of man; confidence and implicit
      reliance upon wisdom, rightenousness, goodness, and
      immutability of God&#39;s purpose.&quot;

      Raamah (Gen. 10:7). His descendants are mentioned in Isa.
      21:13, and Ezek. 27:15. They probably settled among the
      sons of Cush, on the north-west coast of the Persian
      Gulf.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A son of Jokshan, Abraham&#39;s son by Keturah (1 Chr.
      1:32). His descendants settled on the Syrian borders about
      the territory of Edom. They probably led a pastoral life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001004"><b>Dedanim -</b> the descendants of
      Dedan, the son of Raamah. They are mentioned in Isa. 21:13
      as sending out &quot;travelling companies&quot; which
      lodged &quot;in the forest of Arabia.&quot; They are
      enumerated also by Ezekiel (27:20) among the merchants who
      supplied Tyre with precious things.</a>

      <a name="T0001005"><b>Dedication, Feast of the -</b> (John
      10:22, 42), i.e., the feast of the renewing. It was
      instituted B.C. 164 to commemorate the purging of the
      temple after its pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes (B.C.
      167), and the rebuilding of the altar after the Syrian
      invaders had been driven out by Judas Maccabaeus. It lasted
      for eight days, beginning on the 25th of the month Chisleu
      (December), which was often a period of heavy rains (Ezra
      10:9, 13). It was an occasion of much rejoicing and
      festivity.</a>

      But there were other dedications of the temple. (1) That of
      Solomon&#39;s temple (1 Kings 8:2; 2 Chr. 5:3); (2) the
      dedication in the days of Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29); and (3) the
      dedication of the temple after the Captivity (Ezra 6:16).

      grave or the abyss (Rom. 10:7; Luke 8:31); (2) the deepest
      part of the sea (Ps. 69:15); (3) the chaos mentioned in
      Gen. 1:2; (4) the bottomless pit, hell (Rev. 9:1, 2; 11:7;

      a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120-134
      inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the
      circumstance that these psalms came to be sung by the
      people on the ascents or goings up to Jerusalem to attend
      the three great festivals (Deut. 16:16). They were well
      fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form,
      and from the sentiments they express. &quot;They are
      characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora
      [i.e, repetition], and by their epigrammatic style...More
      than half of them are cheerful, and all of them
      hopeful.&quot; They are sometimes called &quot;Pilgrim
      Songs.&quot; Four of them were written by David, one (127)
      by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.</a>

      Assyrian tribes which Asnapper sent to repopulate Samaria
      (Ezra 4:9). They were probably a nomad Persian tribe on the
      east of the Caspian Sea, and near the Sea of Azof.</a>

      The head of the twenty-third division of the priestly order
      (1 Chr. 24:18).</a>

      (2.) A son of Shemaiah, and one of the courtiers to whom
      Jeremiah&#39;s first roll of prophecy was read (Jer.
      36:12).

    <p>

      Philistine woman who dwelt in the valley of Sorek (Judg.
      16:4-20). She was bribed by the &quot;lords of the
      Philistines&quot; to obtain from Samson the secret of his
      strength and the means of overcoming it (Judg. 16:4-18).
      She tried on three occasions to obtain from him this secret
      in vain. On the fourth occasion she wrung it from him. She
      made him sleep upon her knees, and then called the man who
      was waiting to help her; who &quot;cut off the seven locks
      of his head,&quot; and so his &quot;strength went from

      <a name="T0001011"><b>Deluge -</b> the name given to
      Noah&#39;s flood, the history of which is recorded in Gen.
      7 and 8.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It began in the year 2516 B.C., and continued twelve lunar
      months and ten days, or exactly one solar year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of this judgment was the corruption and violence
      that filled the earth in the ninth generation from Adam.
      God in righteous indignation determined to purge the earth
      of the ungodly race. Amid a world of crime and guilt there
      was one household that continued faithful and true to God,
      the household of Noah. &quot;Noah was a just man and
      perfect in his generations.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the command of God, Noah made an ark 300 cubits long, 50
      broad, and 30 high. He slowly proceeded with this work
      during a period of one hundred and twenty years (Gen. 6:3).
      At length the purpose of God began to be carried into
      effect. The following table exhibits the order of events as
      they occurred:
    </p>
    <p>
      In the six hundredth year of his life Noah is commanded by
      God to enter the ark, taking with him his wife, and his
      three sons with their wives (Gen. 7:1-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain begins on the seventeenth day of the second month
      (Gen. 7:11-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain ceases, the waters prevail, fifteen cubits upward
      (Gen. 7:18-24).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ark grounds on one of the mountains of Ararat on the
      seventeenth day of the seventh month, or one hundred and
      fifty days after the Deluge began (Gen. 8:1-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Tops of the mountains visible on the first day of the tenth
      month (Gen. 8:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Raven and dove sent out forty days after this (Gen. 8:6-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dove again sent out seven days afterwards; and in the
      evening she returns with an olive leaf in her mouth (Gen.
      8:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dove sent out the third time after an interval of other
      seven days, and returns no more (Gen. 8:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground becomes dry on the first day of the first month
      of the new year (Gen. 8:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah leaves the ark on the twenty-seventh day of the second
      month (Gen. 8:14-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      The historical truth of the narrative of the Flood is
      established by the references made to it by our Lord (Matt.
      24:37; comp. Luke 17:26). Peter speaks of it also (1 Pet.
      3:20; 2 Pet. 2:5). In Isa. 54:9 the Flood is referred to as
      &quot;the waters of Noah.&quot; The Biblical narrative
      clearly shows that so far as the human race was concerned
      the Deluge was universal; that it swept away all men living
      except Noah and his family, who were preserved in the ark;
      and that the present human race is descended from those who
      were thus preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditions of the Deluge are found among all the great
      divisions of the human family; and these traditions, taken
      as a whole, wonderfully agree with the Biblical narrative,
      and agree with it in such a way as to lead to the
      conclusion that the Biblical is the authentic narrative, of
      which all these traditions are more or less corrupted
      versions. The most remarkable of these traditions is that
      recorded on tablets prepared by order of Assur-bani-pal,
      the king of Assyria. These were, however, copies of older
      records which belonged to somewhere about B.C. 2000, and
      which formed part of the priestly library at Erech (q.v.),
      &quot;the ineradicable remembrance of a real and terrible
      event.&quot; (See NOAH &macr;T0002741; <a href=

      fellow-labourer of Paul during his first imprisonment at
      Rome (Philemon 1:24; Col. 4:14). It appears, however, that
      the love of the world afterwards mastered him, and he
      deserted the apostle (2 Tim. 4:10).</a>

      <a name="T0001013"><b>Demetrius -</b> (1.) A silversmith at
      Ephesus, whose chief occupation was to make &quot;silver
      shrines for Diana&quot; (q.v.), Acts 19:24,i.e., models
      either of the temple of Diana or of the statue of the
      goddess. This trade brought to him and his fellow-craftsmen
      &quot;no small gain,&quot; for these shrines found a ready
      sale among the countless thousands who came to this temple
      from all parts of Asia Minor. This traffic was greatly
      endangered by the progress of the gospel, and hence
      Demetrius excited the tradesmen employed in the manufacture
      of these shrines, and caused so great a tumult that
      &quot;the whole city was filled with confusion.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      (2.) A Christian who is spoken of as having &quot;a good

      <a name="T0001015"><b>Den -</b> a lair of wild beasts (Ps.
      10:9; 104:22; Job 37:8); the hole of a venomous reptile
      (Isa. 11:8); a recess for secrecy &quot;in dens and caves
      of the earth&quot; (Heb. 11:38); a resort of thieves (Matt.
      21:13; Mark 11:17). Daniel was cast into &quot;the den of
      lions&quot; (Dan. 6:16, 17). Some recent discoveries among
      the ruins of Babylon have brought to light the fact that
      the practice of punishing offenders against the law by
      throwing them into a den of lions was common.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001016"><b>Deputy -</b> in 1 Kings 22:47, means
      a prefect; one set over others. The same Hebrew word is
      rendered &quot;officer;&quot; i.e., chief of the
      commissariat appointed by Solomon (1 Kings 4:5, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Esther 8:9; 9:3 (R.V., &quot;governor&quot;) it denotes
      a Persian prefect &quot;on this side&quot; i.e., in the
      region west of the Euphrates. It is the modern word <i>
      pasha</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Acts 13:7, 8, 12; 18:12, it denotes a proconsul; i.e.,
      the governor of a Roman province holding his appointment
      from the senate. The Roman provinces were of two kinds, (1)
      senatorial and (2) imperial. The appointment of a governor
      to the former was in the hands of the senate, and he bore
      the title of proconsul (Gr. anthupatos). The appointment of
      a governor to the latter was in the hands of the emperor,
      and he bore the title of propraetor (Gr. antistrategos).

      <a name="T0001017"><b>Derbe -</b> a small town on the
      eastern part of the upland plain of Lycaonia, about 20
      miles from Lystra. Paul passed through Derbe on his route
      from Cilicia to Iconium, on his second missionary journey
      (Acts 16:1), and probably also on his third journey (18:23;
      19:1). On his first journey (14:20, 21) he came to Derbe
      from the other side; i.e., from Iconium. It was the native
      place of Gaius, one of Paul&#39;s companions (20:4). He did
      not here suffer persecution (2 Tim. 3:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001018"><b>Desert -</b> (1.) Heb. midbar,
      &quot;pasture-ground;&quot; an open tract for pasturage; a
      common (Joel 2:22). The &quot;backside of the desert&quot;
      (Ex. 3:1) is the west of the desert, the region behind a
      man, as the east is the region in front. The same Hebrew
      word is rendered &quot;wildernes,&quot; and is used of the
      country lying between Egypt and Palestine (Gen. 21:14, 21;
      Ex. 4:27; 19:2; Josh. 1:4), the wilderness of the
      wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and
      herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of
      their journey to the Promised Land.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness
      of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good
      pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over
      it (1 Kings 9:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the
      western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his
      father&#39;s flocks (1 Sam. 17:28; 26:2). Thus in both of
      these instances the word denotes a country without settled
      inhabitants and without streams of water, but having good
      pasturage for cattle; a country of wandering tribes, as
      distinguished from that of a settled people (Isa. 35:1;
      50:2; Jer. 4:11). Such, also, is the meaning of the word
      &quot;wilderness&quot; in Matt. 3:3; 15:33; Luke 15:4.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The translation of the Hebrew <i>Aribah&#39;</i>,
      &quot;an arid tract&quot; (Isa. 35:1, 6; 40:3; 41:19; 51:3,
      etc.). The name Arabah is specially applied to the deep
      valley of the Jordan (the Ghor of the Arabs), which extends
      from the lake of Tiberias to the Elanitic gulf. While <i>
      midbar</i> denotes properly a pastoral region, <i>
      arabah</i> denotes a wilderness. It is also translated
      &quot;plains;&quot; as &quot;the plains of Jericho&quot;
      (Josh. 5:10; 2 Kings 25:5), &quot;the plains of Moab&quot;
      (Num. 22:1; Deut. 34:1, 8), &quot;the plains of the
      wilderness&quot; (2 Sam. 17:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In the Revised Version of Num. 21:20 the Hebrew word
      <i>jeshimon</i> is properly rendered &quot;desert,&quot;
      meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea.
      This word is also rendered &quot;desert&quot; in Ps. 78:40;
      106:14; Isa. 43:19, 20. It denotes a greater extent of
      uncultivated country than the other words so rendered. It
      is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of
      Arabia (Num. 21:20; 23:28), the most terrible of all the
      deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is
      called &quot;the desert&quot; in Ex. 23:31; Deut. 11:24.

      Ps. 102:6, Isa. 48:21, and Ezek. 13:4, where it means the
      wilderness of Sinai.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they
      had forsaken God (Isa. 40:3). Nations destitute of the
      knowledge of God are called a &quot;wilderness&quot;
      (32:15, <i>midbar</i>). It is a symbol of temptation,
      solitude, and persecution (Isa. 27:10, <i>midbar_; 33:9,
      _arabah</i>).

      manuscripts the Pentateuch (q.v.) forms one roll or volume
      divided into larger and smaller sections called <i>
      parshioth_ and _sedarim</i>. It is not easy to say when it
      was divided into five books. This was probably first done
      by the Greek translators of the book, whom the Vulgate
      follows. The fifth of these books was called by the Greeks
      Deuteronomion, i.e., the second law, hence our name
      Deuteronomy, or a second statement of the laws already
      promulgated. The Jews designated the book by the two first
      Hebrew words that occur, _&#39;Elle haddabharim_, i.e.,
      &quot;These are the words.&quot; They divided it into
      eleven <i>parshioth</i>. In the English Bible it contains
      thirty-four chapters.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It consists chiefly of three discourses delivered by Moses
      a short time before his death. They were spoken to all
      Israel in the plains of Moab, in the eleventh month of the
      last year of their wanderings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first discourse (1-4:40) recapitulates the chief events
      of the last forty years in the wilderness, with earnest
      exhortations to obedience to the divine ordinances, and
      warnings against the danger of forsaking the God of their
      fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seond discourse (5-26:19) is in effect the body of the
      whole book. The first address is introductory to it. It
      contains practically a recapitulation of the law already
      given by God at Mount Sinai, together with many admonitions
      and injunctions as to the course of conduct they were to
      follow when they were settled in Canaan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concluding discourse (ch. 27-30) relates almost wholly
      to the solemn sanctions of the law, the blessings to the
      obedient, and the curse that would fall on the rebellious.
      He solemnly adjures them to adhere faithfully to the
      covenant God had made with them, and so secure for
      themselves and their posterity the promised blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      These addresses to the people are followed by what may be
      called three appendices, namely (1), a song which God had
      commanded Moses to write (32:1-47); (2) the blessings he
      pronounced on the separate tribes (ch. 33); and (3) the
      story of his death (32:48-52) and burial (ch. 34), written
      by some other hand, probably that of Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      These farewell addresses of Moses to the tribes of Israel
      he had so long led in the wilderness &quot;glow in each
      line with the emotions of a great leader recounting to his
      contemporaries the marvellous story of their common
      experience. The enthusiasm they kindle, even to-day, though
      obscured by translation, reveals their matchless adaptation
      to the circumstances under which they were first spoken.
      Confidence for the future is evoked by remembrance of the
      past. The same God who had done mighty works for the tribes
      since the Exodus would cover their head in the day of
      battle with the nations of Palestine, soon to be invaded.
      Their great lawgiver stands before us, vigorous in his
      hoary age, stern in his abhorrence of evil, earnest in his
      zeal for God, but mellowed in all relations to earth by his
      nearness to heaven. The commanding wisdom of his
      enactments, the dignity of his position as the founder of
      the nation and the first of prophets, enforce his
      utterances. But he touches our deepest emotions by the
      human tenderness that breathes in all his words. Standing
      on the verge of life, he speaks as a father giving his
      parting counsels to those he loves; willing to depart and
      be with God he has served so well, but fondly lengthening
      out his last farewell to the dear ones of earth. No book
      can compare with Deuteronomy in its mingled sublimity and
      tenderness.&quot; Geikie, Hours, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole style and method of this book, its tone and its
      peculiarities of conception and expression, show that it
      must have come from one hand. That the author was none
      other than Moses is established by the following
      considerations: (1.) The uniform tradition both of the
      Jewish and the Christian Church down to recent times. (2.)
      The book professes to have been written by Moses (1:1;
      29:1; 31:1, 9-11, etc.), and was obviously intended to be
      accepted as his work. (3.) The incontrovertible testimony
      of our Lord and his apostles (Matt. 19:7, 8; Mark 10:3, 4;
      John 5:46, 47; Acts 3:22; 7:37; Rom. 10:19) establishes the
      same conclusion. (4.) The frequent references to it in the
      later books of the canon (Josh. 8:31; 1 Kings 2:9; 2 Kings
      14:6; 2 Chr. 23:18; 25:4; 34:14; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1;
      Dan. 9:11, 13) prove its antiquity; and (5) the archaisms
      found in it are in harmony with the age in which Moses
      lived. (6.) Its style and allusions are also strikingly
      consistent with the circumstances and position of Moses and
      of the people at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This body of positive evidence cannot be set aside by the
      conjectures and reasonings of modern critics, who contended
      that the book was somewhat like a forgery, introduced among
      the Jews some seven or eight centuries after the Exodus.

    <p>
      <a name="T0001025"><b>Devil -</b> (Gr. diabolos), a
      slanderer, the arch-enemy of man&#39;s spiritual interest
      (Job 1:6; Rev. 2:10; Zech. 3:1). He is called also
      &quot;the accuser of the brethen&quot; (Rev. 12:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lev. 17:7 the word &quot;devil&quot; is the translation
      of the Hebrew <i>sair</i>, meaning a &quot;goat&quot; or
      &quot;satyr&quot; (Isa. 13:21; 34:14), alluding to the
      wood-daemons, the objects of idolatrous worship among the
      heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Deut. 32:17 and Ps. 106:37 it is the translation of
      Hebrew <i>shed</i>, meaning lord, and idol, regarded by the
      Jews as a &quot;demon,&quot; as the word is rendered in the
      Revised Version.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the narratives of the Gospels regarding the
      &quot;casting out of devils&quot; a different Greek word
      (daimon) is used. In the time of our Lord there were
      frequent cases of demoniacal possession (Matt. 12:25-30;
      Mark 5:1-20; Luke 4:35; 10:18, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001026"><b>Dew -</b> &quot;There is no dew
      properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture
      in the hot summer air to be chilled into dew-drops by the
      coldness of the night. From May till October rain is
      unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day
      after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and
      vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that
      come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the
      heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that
      the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a
      peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered
      thousands of years ago (Gen. 31:40). To this coldness of
      the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life
      is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it
      as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into
      drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on
      every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created
      rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of
      the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many
      islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes.
      By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast
      snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate
      masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the
      blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are
      &#39;the morning clouds and the early dew that go away&#39;
      of which Hosea (6:4; 13:3) speaks so touchingly&quot;
      (Geikie&#39;s The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a
      source of great fertility (Gen. 27:28; Deut. 33:13; Zech.
      8:12), and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God
      (2 Sam. 1:21; 1 Kings 17:1). It is the symbol of a
      multitude (2 Sam. 17:12; Ps. 110:3); and from its
      refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and
      harmony (Ps. 133:3), and of rich spiritual blessings (Hos.
      14:5).</a>

      the New Testament a careful distinction is drawn between
      the diadem as a badge of royalty (Rev. 12:3; 13:1; 19:12)
      and the crown as a mark of distinction in private life. It
      is not known what the ancient Jewish &quot;diadem&quot;
      was. It was the mark of Oriental sovereigns. (See <a href=

      rendered &quot;steps&quot; in Ex. 20:26, 1 Kings 10:19, and
      &quot;degrees&quot; in 2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11. The <i>
      ma&#39;aloth</i> was probably stairs on which the shadow of
      a column or obelisk placed on the top fell. The shadow
      would cover a greater or smaller number of steps, according

      <a name="T0001044"><b>Dispensation -</b> (Gr. oikonomia,
      &quot;management,&quot; &quot;economy&quot;). (1.) The
      method or scheme according to which God carries out his
      purposes towards men is called a dispensation. There are
      usually reckoned three dispensations, the Patriarchal, the
      Mosaic or Jewish, and the Christian. (See COVENANT
      &macr;T0000916, Administration of.) These were so many
      stages in God&#39;s unfolding of his purpose of grace
      toward men. The word is not found with this meaning in
      Scripture.</a>

      <a name="T0001045"><b>Dispersion -</b> (Gr. diaspora,
      &quot;scattered,&quot; James 1:1; 1 Pet. 1:1) of the Jews.
      At various times, and from the operation of divers causes,
      the Jews were separated and scattered into foreign
      countries &quot;to the outmost parts of heaven&quot; (Deut.
      30:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Many were dispersed over Assyria, Media, Babylonia,
      and Persia, descendants of those who had been transported
      thither by the Exile. The ten tribes, after existing as a
      separate kingdom for two hundred and fifty-five years, were
      carried captive (B.C. 721) by Shalmaneser (or Sargon), king
      of Assyria. They never returned to their own land as a
      distinct people, although many individuals from among these
      tribes, there can be no doubt, joined with the bands that
      returned from Babylon on the proclamation of Cyrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Many Jews migrated to Egypt and took up their abode
      there. This migration began in the days of Solomon (2 Kings
      18:21, 24; Isa. 30:7). Alexander the Great placed a large
      number of Jews in Alexandria, which he had founded, and
      conferred on them equal rights with the Egyptians. Ptolemy
      Philadelphus, it is said, caused the Jewish Scriptures to
      be translated into Greek (the work began B.C. 284), for the
      use of the Alexandrian Jews. The Jews in Egypt continued
      for many ages to exercise a powerful influence on the
      public interests of that country. From Egypt they spread
      along the coast of Africa to Cyrene (Acts 2:10) and to
      Ethiopia (8:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) After the time of Seleucus Nicator (B.C. 280), one of
      the captains of Alexander the Great, large numbers of Jews
      migrated into Syria, where they enjoyed equal rights with
      the Macedonians. From Syria they found their way into Asia
      Minor. Antiochus the Great, king of Syria and Asia, removed
      3,000 families of Jews from Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and
      planted them in Phrygia and Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) From Asia Minor many Jews moved into Greece and
      Macedonia, chiefly for purposes of commerce. In the
      apostles&#39; time they were found in considerable numbers
      in all the principal cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of Pompey the Great (B.C. 63) numbers of Jews
      from Palestine and Greece went to Rome, where they had a
      separate quarter of the city assigned to them. Here they
      enjoyed considerable freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were the Jews everywhere scattered abroad. This, in
      the overruling providence of God, ultimately contributed in
      a great degree toward opening the way for the spread of the
      gospel into all lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dispersion, from the plain of Shinar. This was occasioned
      by the confusion of tongues at Babel (Gen. 11:9). They were
      scattered abroad &quot;every one after his tongue, after
      their families, in their nations&quot; (Gen. 10:5, 20,31).
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenth chapter of Genesis gives us an account of the
      principal nations of the earth in their migrations from the
      plain of Shinar, which was their common residence after the
      Flood. In general, it may be said that the descendants of
      Japheth were scattered over the north, those of Shem over
      the central regions, and those of Ham over the extreme
      south. The following table shows how the different families
      were dispersed:
    </p>
    <p>
      | - Japheth | - Gomer | Cimmerians, Armenians | - Magog |
      Caucasians, Scythians | - Madal | Medes and Persian tribes

      <a name="T0001047"><b>Divination -</b> of false prophets
      (Deut. 18:10, 14; Micah 3:6, 7, 11), of necromancers (1
      Sam. 28:8), of the Philistine priests and diviners (1 Sam.
      6:2), of Balaam (Josh. 13:22). Three kinds of divination
      are mentioned in Ezek. 21:21, by arrows, consulting with
      images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of
      animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have
      been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded
      among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines (Isa.
      2:6; 1 Sam. 28). At a later period multitudes of magicians
      poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and
      pursued their occupations (Isa. 8:19; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr.
      33:6). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of
      the apostles there were &quot;vagabond Jews,
      exorcists&quot; (Acts 19:13), and men like Simon Magus
      (Acts 8:9), Bar-jesus (13:6, 8), and other jugglers and
      impostors (19:19; 2 Tim. 3:13). Every species and degree of
      this superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of
      Moses (Ex. 22:18; Lev. 19:26, 31; 20:27; Deut. 18:10,
      11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond these various forms of superstition, there are
      instances of divination on record in the Scriptures by
      which God was pleased to make known his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) There was divination by lot, by which, when resorted
      to in matters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated
      his will (Josh. 7:13). The land of Canaan was divided by
      lot (Num. 26:55, 56); Achan&#39;s guilt was detected (Josh.
      7:16-19), Saul was elected king (1 Sam. 10:20, 21), and
      Matthias chosen to the apostleship, by the solem lot (Acts
      1:26). It was thus also that the scape-goat was determined
      (Lev. 16:8-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) There was divination by dreams (Gen. 20:6; Deut. 13:1,
      3; Judg. 7:13, 15; Matt. 1:20; 2:12, 13, 19, 22). This is
      illustrated in the history of Joseph (Gen. 41:25-32) and of
      Daniel (2:27; 4:19-28).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) By divine appointment there was also divination by the
      Urim and Thummim (Num. 27:21), and by the ephod.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) God was pleased sometimes to vouch-safe direct vocal
      communications to men (Deut. 34:10; Ex. 3:4; 4:3; Deut.
      4:14, 15; 1 Kings 19:12). He also communed with men from
      above the mercy-seat (Ex. 25:22), and at the door of the
      tabernacle (Ex. 29:42, 43).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Through his prophets God revealed himself, and gave
      intimations of his will (2 Kings 13:17; Jer. 51:63, 64).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001048"><b>Divorce -</b> The dissolution of the
      marriage tie was regulated by the Mosaic law (Deut.
      24:1-4). The Jews, after the Captivity, were reguired to
      dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the
      law (Ezra 10:11-19). Christ limited the permission of
      divorce to the single case of adultery. It seems that it
      was not uncommon for the Jews at that time to dissolve the
      union on very slight pretences (Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:1-9;
      Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18). These precepts given by Christ
      regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church.</a>

      in the desert of Sinai, on the western shore of the

    <p>
      <a name="T0001050"><b>Doctor -</b> (Luke 2:46; 5:17; Acts
      5:34), a teacher. The Jewish doctors taught and disputed in
      synagogues, or wherever they could find an audience. Their
      disciples were allowed to propose to them questions. They
      assumed the office without any appointment to it. The
      doctors of the law were principally of the sect of the
      Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction
      of Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical
      degrees were conferred on those who passed a certain
      examination. Those of the school of Tiberias were called by
      the title &quot;rabbi,&quot; and those of Babylon by that
      of &quot;master.&quot;</a>

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001052"><b>Dodanim -</b> leaders, a race
      descended from Javan (Gen. 10:4). They are known in profane
      history as the Dardani, originally inhabiting Illyricum.
      They were a semi-Pelasgic race, and in the ethnographical
      table (Gen. 10) they are grouped with the Chittim (q.v.).
      In 1 Chr. 1:7, they are called Rodanim. The LXX. and the
      Samaritan Version also read Rhodii, whence some have
      concluded that the Rhodians, the inhabitants of the island
      of Rhodes, are meant.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001053"><b>Dodo -</b> amatory; loving. (1.) A
      descendant of Issachar (Judg. 10:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) An Ahohite, father of Eleazar, who was one of
      David&#39;s three heroes (2 Sam. 23:9; 1 Chr. 11:12). He
      was the same with Dodai mentioned in 1 Chr. 27:4.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A Bethlehemite, and father of Elhanan, who was one of
      David&#39;s thirty heroes (2 Sam. 23:24).

      <a name="T0001054"><b>Doeg -</b> fearful, an Edomite, the
      chief overseer of Saul&#39;s flocks (1 Sam. 21:7). At the
      command of Saul he slew the high priest Ahimelech (q.v.) at
      Nob, together with all the priests to the number of
      eighty-five persons. (Comp. Ps. 52, title.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001055"><b>Dog -</b> frequently mentioned both
      in the Old and New Testaments. Dogs were used by the
      Hebrews as a watch for their houses (Isa. 56:10), and for
      guarding their flocks (Job 30:1). There were also then as
      now troops of semi-wild dogs that wandered about devouring
      dead bodies and the offal of the streets (1 Kings 14:11;
      16:4; 21:19, 23; 22:38; Ps. 59:6, 14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dog was an unclean animal, the terms
      &quot;dog,&quot; &quot;dog&#39;s head,&quot; &quot;dead
      dog,&quot; were used as terms of reproach or of humiliation
      (1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 3:8; 9:8; 16:9). Paul calls false
      apostles &quot;dogs&quot; (Phil. 3:2). Those who are shut
      out of the kingdom of heaven are also so designated (Rev.
      22:15). Persecutors are called &quot;dogs&quot; (Ps.
      22:16). Hazael&#39;s words, &quot;Thy servant which is but
      a dog&quot; (2 Kings 8:13), are spoken in mock
      humility=impossible that one so contemptible as he should
      attain to such power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001056"><b>Doleful creatures -</b> (occurring
      only Isa. 13:21. Heb. ochim, i.e., &quot;shrieks;&quot;
      hence &quot;howling animals&quot;), a general name for
      screech owls (howlets), which occupy the desolate palaces
      of Babylon. Some render the word &quot;hyaenas.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001057"><b>Door-keeper -</b> This word is used
      in Ps. 84:10 (R.V. marg., &quot;stand at the threshold
      of,&quot; etc.), but there it signifies properly
      &quot;sitting at the threshold in the house of God.&quot;
      The psalmist means that he would rather stand at the door
      of God&#39;s house and merely look in, than dwell in houses
      where iniquity prevailed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons were appointed to keep the street door leading into
      the interior of the house (John 18:16, 17; Acts 12:13).
      Sometimes females held this post.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001058"><b>Door-posts -</b> The Jews were
      commanded to write the divine name on the posts
      (mezuzoth&#39;) of their doors (Deut. 6:9). The Jews,
      misunderstanding this injunction, adopted the custom of
      writing on a slip of parchment these verses (Deut. 6:4-9,
      and 11:13-21), which they enclosed in a reed or cylinder
      and fixed on the right-hand door-post of every room in the
      house.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001059"><b>Doors -</b> moved on pivots of wood
      fastened in sockets above and below (Prov. 26:14). They
      were fastened by a lock (Judg. 3:23, 25; Cant. 5:5) or by a
      bar (Judg. 16:3; Job 38:10). In the interior of Oriental
      houses, curtains were frequently used instead of doors.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrances of the tabernacle had curtains (Ex. 26:31-33,
      36). The &quot;valley of Achor&quot; is called a &quot;door
      of hope,&quot; because immediately after the execution of
      Achan the Lord said to Joshua, &quot;Fear not,&quot; and
      from that time Joshua went forward in a career of
      uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a &quot;door
      opened&quot; for the spread of the gospel (1 Cor. 16:9; 2
      Cor. 2:12; Col. 4:3). Our Lord says of himself, &quot;I am
      the door&quot; (John 10:9). John (Rev. 4:1) speaks of a
      &quot;door opened in heaven.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001060"><b>Dophkah -</b> knocking, an encampment
      of the Israelites in the wilderness (Num. 33:12). It was in
      the desert of Sin, on the eastern shore of the western arm
      of the Red Sea, somewhere in the Wady Feiran.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001061"><b>Dor -</b> dwelling, the Dora of the
      Romans, an ancient royal city of the Canaanites (Josh.
      11:1, 2; 12:23). It was the most southern settlement of the
      Phoenicians on the coast of Syria. The original inhabitants
      seem never to have been expelled, although they were made
      tributary by David. It was one of Solomon&#39;s
      commissariat districts (Judg. 1:27; 1 Kings 4:11). It has
      been identified with Tantura (so named from the supposed
      resemblance of its tower to a tantur, i.e., &quot;a
      horn&quot;). This tower fell in 1895, and nothing remains
      but debris and foundation walls, the remains of an old
      Crusading fortress. It is about 8 miles north of Caesarea,
      &quot;a sad and sickly hamlet of wretched huts on a naked
      sea-beach.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001062"><b>Dorcas -</b> a female antelope, or
      gazelle, a pious Christian widow at Joppa whom Peter
      restored to life (Acts 9:36-41). She was a Hellenistic
      Jewess, called Tabitha by the Jews and Dorcas by the
      Greeks.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001063"><b>Dothan -</b> two wells, a famous
      pasture-ground where Joseph found his brethren watching
      their flocks. Here, at the suggestion of Judah, they sold
      him to the Ishmaelite merchants (Gen. 37:17). It is
      mentioned on monuments in B.C. 1600.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the residence of Elisha (2 Kings 6:13), and the
      scene of a remarkable vision of chariots and horses of fire
      surrounding the mountain on which the city stood. It is
      identified with the modern Tell-Dothan, on the south side
      of the plain of Jezreel, about 12 miles north of Samaria,
      among the hills of Gilboa. The &quot;two wells&quot; are
      still in existence, one of which bears the name of the
      &quot;pit of Joseph&quot; (Jubb Yusuf).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001064"><b>Dough -</b> (batsek, meaning
      &quot;swelling,&quot; i.e., in fermentation). The dough the
      Israelites had prepared for baking was carried away by them
      out of Egypt in their kneading-troughs (Ex. 12:34, 39). In
      the process of baking, the dough had to be turned (Hos.
      7:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001065"><b>Dove -</b> In their wild state doves
      generally build their nests in the clefts of rocks, but
      when domesticated &quot;dove-cots&quot; are prepared for
      them (Cant. 2:14; Jer. 48:28; Isa. 60:8). The dove was
      placed on the standards of the Assyrians and Babylonians in
      honour, it is supposed, of Semiramis (Jer. 25:38; Vulg.,
      &quot;fierceness of the dove;&quot; comp. Jer. 46:16;
      50:16). Doves and turtle-doves were the only birds that
      could be offered in sacrifice, as they were clean according
      to the Mosaic law (Ge. 15:9; Lev. 5:7; 12:6; Luke 2:24).
      The dove was the harbinger of peace to Noah (Gen. 8:8, 10).
      It is often mentioned as the emblem of purity (Ps. 68:13).
      It is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (Gen. 1:2; Matt. 3:16;
      Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32); also of tender and
      devoted affection (Cant. 1:15; 2:14). David in his distress
      wished that he had the wings of a dove, that he might fly
      away and be at rest (Ps. 55:6-8). There is a species of
      dove found at Damascus &quot;whose feathers, all except the
      wings, are literally as yellow as gold&quot; (68:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001066"><b>Dove&#39;s dung -</b> (2 Kings 6:25)
      has been generally understood literally. There are
      instances in history of the dung of pigeons being actually
      used as food during a famine. Compare also the language of
      Rabshakeh to the Jews (2 Kings 18:27; Isa. 36:12). This
      name, however, is applied by the Arabs to different
      vegetable substances, and there is room for the opinion of
      those who think that some such substance is here referred

      for a wife, Gen. 34:12; Ex. 22:17; 1 Sam. 18:25), a nuptial
      present; some gift, as a sum of money, which the bridegroom
      offers to the father of his bride as a satisfaction before
      he can receive her. Jacob had no dowry to give for his
      wife, but he gave his services (Gen. 29:18; 30:20;
      34:12).</a>

      <a name="T0001068"><b>Dragon -</b> (1.) Heb. tannim, plural
      of tan. The name of some unknown creature inhabiting desert
      places and ruins (Job 30:29; Ps. 44:19; Isa. 13:22; 34:13;
      43:20; Jer. 10:22; Micah 1:8; Mal. 1:3); probably, as
      translated in the Revised Version, the jackal (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. tannin. Some great sea monster (Jer. 51:34). In
      Isa. 51:9 it may denote the crocodile. In Gen. 1:21 (Heb.
      plural tanninim) the Authorized Version renders
      &quot;whales,&quot; and the Revised Version &quot;sea
      monsters.&quot; It is rendered &quot;serpent&quot; in Ex.
      7:9. It is used figuratively in Ps. 74:13; Ezek. 29:3.

    <p>
      In the New Testament the word &quot;dragon&quot; is found
      only in Rev. 12:3, 4, 7, 9, 16, 17, etc., and is there used
      metaphorically of &quot;Satan.&quot; (See <a href=

      7:70), as equivalent to the Greek silver coin the drachma.
      But the Revised Version rightly regards it as the Greek
      dareikos, a Persian gold coin (the daric) of the value of
      about 1 pound, 2s., which was first struck by Darius, the
      son of Hystaspes, and was current in Western Asia long
      after the fall of the Persian empire. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0001073"><b>Dream -</b> God has frequently made
      use of dreams in communicating his will to men. The most
      remarkable instances of this are recorded in the history of
      Jacob (Gen. 28:12; 31:10), Laban (31:24), Joseph (37:9-11),
      Gideon (Judg. 7), and Solomon (1 Kings 3:5). Other
      significant dreams are also recorded, such as those of
      Abimelech (Gen. 20:3-7), Pharaoh&#39;s chief butler and
      baker (40:5), Pharaoh (41:1-8), the Midianites (Judg.
      7:13), Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:1; 4:10, 18), the wise men
      from the east (Matt. 2:12), and Pilate&#39;s wife
      (27:19).</a>

      To Joseph &quot;the Lord appeared in a dream,&quot; and
      gave him instructions regarding the infant Jesus (Matt.
      1:20; 2:12, 13, 19). In a vision of the night a &quot;man
      of Macedonia&quot; stood before Paul and said, &quot;Come
      over into Macedonia and help us&quot; (Acts 16:9; see also
      18:9; 27:23).

      vessel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001076"><b>Dress -</b> (1.) Materials used. The
      earliest and simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together
      (Gen. 3:7); then skins of animals (3:21). Elijah&#39;s
      dress was probably the skin of a sheep (2 Kings 1:8). The
      Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair
      into cloth (Ex. 26:7; 35:6), which formed the sackcloth of
      mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist&#39;s
      robe (Matt. 3:4). Wool was also woven into garments (Lev.
      13:47; Deut. 22:11; Ezek. 34:3; Job 31:20; Prov. 27:26).
      The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen
      when they were in Egypt (1 Chr. 4:21). Fine linen was used
      in the vestments of the high priest (Ex. 28:5), as well as
      by the rich (Gen. 41:42; Prov. 31:22; Luke 16:19). The use
      of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden (Lev.
      19:19; Deut. 22:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of
      the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by
      the fuller&#39;s art (Ps. 104:1, 2; Isa. 63:3; Mark 9:3).
      The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing (Gen.
      37:3, 23). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in
      the process of weaving (Ex. 28:6; 26:1, 31; 35:25), and by
      needle-work (Judg. 5:30; Ps. 45:13). Dyed robes were
      imported from foreign countries, particularly from
      Phoenicia (Zeph. 1:8). Purple and scarlet robes were the
      marks of the wealthy (Luke 16:19; 2 Sam. 1:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Form. The robes of men and women were not very much
      different in form from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The &quot;coat&quot; (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or
      linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting
      garment, resembling in use and form our shirt (John 19:23).
      It was kept close to the body by a girdle (John 21:7). A
      person wearing this &quot;coat&quot; alone was described as
      naked (1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 20:2; 2 Kings 6:30; John 21:7);
      deprived of it he would be absolutely naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used
      somewhat as a night-shirt (Mark 14:51). It is mentioned in
      Judg. 14:12, 13, and rendered there &quot;sheets.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the &quot;coat&quot;
      (1 Sam. 2:19; 24:4; 28:14). In 1 Sam. 28:14 it is the
      mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in 1 Sam. 24:4 it is
      the &quot;robe&quot; under which Saul slept. The disciples
      were forbidden to wear two &quot;coats&quot; (Matt. 10:10;
      Luke 9:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen
      cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or
      thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends
      hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head
      so as to conceal the face (2 Sam. 15:30; Esther 6:12). It
      was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed
      by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket (2 Kings
      4:39; Ps. 79:12; Hag. 2:12; Prov. 17:23; 21:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Female dress. The &quot;coat&quot; was common to both sexes
      (Cant. 5:3). But peculiar to females were (1) the
      &quot;veil&quot; or &quot;wimple,&quot; a kind of shawl
      (Ruth 3:15; rendered &quot;mantle,&quot; R.V., Isa. 3:22);
      (2) the &quot;mantle,&quot; also a species of shawl (Isa.
      3:22); (3) a &quot;veil,&quot; probably a light summer
      dress (Gen. 24:65); (4) a &quot;stomacher,&quot; a holiday
      dress (Isa. 3:24). The outer garment terminated in an ample
      fringe or border, which concealed the feet (Isa. 47:2; Jer.
      13:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress of the Persians is described in Dan. 3:21.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the
      garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being
      worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes
      devolved on the women of a family (Prov. 31:22; Acts 9:39).
    </p>
    <p>
      Extravagance in dress is referred to in Jer. 4:30; Ezek.
      16:10; Zeph. 1:8 (R.V., &quot;foreign apparel&quot;); 1
      Tim. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:3. Rending the robes was expressive of
      grief (Gen. 37:29, 34), fear (1 Kings 21:27), indignation
      (2 Kings 5:7), or despair (Judg. 11:35; Esther 4:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them,
      was a sign of renunciation (Acts 18:6); wrapping them round
      the head, of awe (1 Kings 19:13) or grief (2 Sam. 15:30;
      casting them off, of excitement (Acts 22:23); laying hold
      of them, of supplication (1 Sam. 15:27). In the case of
      travelling, the outer garments were girded up (1 Kings
      18:46). They were thrown aside also when they would impede
      action (Mark 10:50; John 13:4; Acts 7:58).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001077"><b>Drink -</b> The drinks of the Hebrews
      were water, wine, &quot;strong drink,&quot; and vinegar.
      Their drinking vessels were the cup, goblet or
      &quot;basin,&quot; the &quot;cruse&quot; or pitcher, and
      the saucer.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      To drink water by measure (Ezek. 4:11), and to buy water to
      drink (Lam. 5:4), denote great scarcity. To drink blood
      means to be satiated with slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews carefully strained their drinks through a sieve,
      through fear of violating the law of Lev. 11:20, 23, 41,
      42. (See Matt. 23:24. &quot;Strain at&quot; should be
      &quot;strain out.&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001078"><b>Drink-offering -</b> consisted of
      wine (Num. 15:5; Hos. 9:4) poured around the altar (Ex.
      30:9). Joined with meat-offerings (Num. 6:15, 17; 2 Kings
      16:13; Joel 1:9, 13; 2:14), presented daily (Ex. 29:40), on
      the Sabbath (Num. 28:9), and on feast-days (28:14).
      One-fourth of an hin of wine was required for one lamb,
      one-third for a ram, and one-half for a bullock (Num. 15:5;
      28:7, 14). &quot;Drink offerings of blood&quot; (Ps. 16:4)
      is used in allusion to the heathen practice of mingling the
      blood of animals sacrificed with wine or water, and pouring
      out the mixture in the worship of the gods, and the idea
      conveyed is that the psalmist would not partake of the
      abominations of the heathen.</a>

      <a name="T0001079"><b>Drink, strong -</b> (Heb.
      shekar&#39;), an intoxicating liquor (Judg. 13:4; Luke
      1:15; Isa. 5:11; Micah 2:11) distilled from corn, honey, or
      dates. The effects of the use of strong drink are referred
      to in Ps. 107:27; Isa. 24:20; 49:26; 51:17-22. Its use
      prohibited, Prov. 20:1. (See <a href=

      African or Arabian species of camel having only one hump,
      while the Bactrian camel has two. It is distinguished from
      the camel only as a trained saddle-horse is distinguished
      from a cart-horse. It is remarkable for its speed (Jer.
      2:23). Camels are frequently spoken of in partriarchal
      times (Gen. 12:16; 24:10; 30:43; 31:17, etc.). They were
      used for carrying burdens (Gen. 37:25; Judg. 6:5), and for
      riding (Gen. 24:64). The hair of the camel falls off of
      itself in spring, and is woven into coarse cloths and
      garments (Matt. 3:4). (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0001085"><b>Drunk -</b> The first case of
      intoxication on record is that of Noah (Gen. 9:21). The sin
      of drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned (Rom.
      13:13; 1 Cor. 6:9, 10; Eph. 5:18; 1 Thess. 5:7, 8). The sin
      of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among
      the Israelites.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as
      being drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God&#39;s
      wrath (Isa. 63:6; Jer. 51:57; Ezek. 23:33). To &quot;add
      drunkenness to thirst&quot; (Deut. 29:19, A.V.) is a
      proverbial expression, rendered in the Revised Version
      &quot;to destroy the moist with the dry&quot;, i.e., the
      well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the
      effect of such walking in the imagination of their own
      hearts would be to destroy one and all.

      She was present with Felix when Paul reasoned of
      &quot;righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come&quot;
      (Acts 24:24). She and her son perished in the eruption of

      Revised Version it is styled the &quot;bag-pipe.&quot;
      Luther translated it &quot;lute,&quot; and Grotius the
      &quot;crooked trumpet.&quot; It is probable that it was
      introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic
      musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by
      &quot;organ,&quot; the well-known instrument composed of a
      series of pipes, others by &quot;lyre.&quot; The most

      There was also a town of this name in Judah (Josh. 15:52),

      (2.) Used as fuel, a substitute for firewood, which was
      with difficulty procured in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt (Ezek.
      4:12-15), where cows&#39; and camels&#39; dung is used to
      the present day for this purpose.

      <a name="T0001092"><b>Dungeon -</b> different from the
      ordinary prison in being more severe as a place of
      punishment. Like the Roman inner prison (Acts 16:24), it
      consisted of a deep cell or cistern (Jer. 38:6). To be shut
      up in, a punishment common in Egypt (Gen. 39:20; 40:3;
      41:10; 42:19). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of
      Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings
      imprisonment was frequently used as a punishment (2 Chron.
      16:10; Jer. 20:2; 32:2; 33:1; 37:15), and it was customary
      after the Exile (Matt. 11:2; Luke 3:20; Acts 5:18, 21;
      Matt. 18:30).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001093"><b>Dung-gate -</b> (Neh. 2:13), a gate
      of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. &quot;The
      gate outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and
      offscourings of the streets,&quot; in the valley of
      Tophet.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001094"><b>Dung-hill -</b> to sit on a, was a
      sign of the deepest dejection (1 Sam. 2:8; Ps. 113:7; Lam.
      4:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001095"><b>Dura -</b> the circle, the plain near
      Babylon in which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image,
      mentioned in Dan. 3:1. The place still retains its ancient
      name. On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must
      have been a colossal statue has been found. It has been
      supposed to be that of the golden image.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001096"><b>Dust -</b> Storms of sand and dust
      sometimes overtake Eastern travellers. They are very
      dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to
      bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking
      him, a rain of &quot;powder and dust&quot; (Deut.
      28:24).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      To cast dust on the head was a sign of mourning (Josh.
      7:6); and to sit in dust, of extreme affliction (Isa.
      47:1). &quot;Dust&quot; is used to denote the grave (Job
      7:21). &quot;To shake off the dust from one&#39;s
      feet&quot; against another is to renounce all future
      intercourse with him (Matt. 10:14; Acts 13:51). To
      &quot;lick the dust&quot; is a sign of abject submission
      (Ps. 72:9); and to throw dust at one is a sign of
      abhorrence (2 Sam. 16:13; comp. Acts 22:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001097"><b>Dwarf -</b> a lean or emaciated
      person (Lev. 21:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001098"><b>Dwell -</b> Tents were in primitive
      times the common dwellings of men. Houses were afterwards
      built, the walls of which were frequently of mud (Job
      24:16; Matt. 6:19, 20) or of sun-dried bricks.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      God &quot;dwells in light&quot; (1 Tim. 6:16; 1 John 1:7),
      in heaven (Ps. 123:1), in his church (Ps. 9:11; 1 John
      4:12). Christ dwelt on earth in the days of his humiliation
      (John 1:14). He now dwells in the hearts of his people
      (Eph. 3:17-19). The Holy Spirit dwells in believers (1 Cor.
      3:16; 2 Tim. 1:14). We are exhorted to &quot;let the word
      of God dwell in us richly&quot; (Col. 3:16; Ps. 119:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dwell deep occurs only in Jer. 49:8, and refers to the
      custom of seeking refuge from impending danger, in retiring
      to the recesses of rocks and caverns, or to remote places
      in the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001099"><b>Dwellings -</b> The materials used in
      buildings were commonly bricks, sometimes also stones (Lev.
      14:40, 42), which were held together by cement (Jer. 43:9)
      or bitumen (Gen. 11:3). The exterior was usually
      whitewashed (Lev. 14:41; Ezek. 13:10; Matt. 23:27). The
      beams were of sycamore (Isa. 9:10), or olive-wood, or cedar
      (1 Kings 7:2; Isa. 9:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of Eastern dwellings differed in many respects
      from that of dwellings in Western lands. The larger houses
      were built in a quadrangle enclosing a court-yard (Luke
      5:19; 2 Sam. 17:18; Neh. 8:16) surrounded by galleries,
      which formed the guest-chamber or reception-room for
      visitors. The flat roof, surrounded by a low parapet, was
      used for many domestic and social purposes. It was reached
      by steps from the court. In connection with it (2 Kings
      23:12) was an upper room, used as a private chamber (2 Sam
      18:33; Dan. 6:11), also as a bedroom (2 Kings 23:12), a
      sleeping apartment for guests (2 Kings 4:10), and as a
      sick-chamber (1 Kings 17:19). The doors, sometimes of
      stone, swung on morticed pivots, and were generally
      fastened by wooden bolts. The houses of the more wealthy
      had a doorkeeper or a female porter (John 18:16; Acts
      12:13). The windows generally opened into the courtyard,
      and were closed by a lattice (Judg. 5:28). The interior
      rooms were set apart for the female portion of the
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture of the room (2 Kings 4:10) consisted of a
      couch furnished with pillows (Amos 6:4; Ezek. 13:20); and
      besides this, chairs, a table and lanterns or lamp-stands
      (2 Kings 4:10).
