      <a name="T0001100"><b>Dye -</b> The art of dyeing is one of
      great antiquity, although no special mention is made of it
      in the Old Testament. The Hebrews probably learned it from
      the Egyptians (see Ex. 26:1; 28:5-8), who brought it to
      great perfection. In New Testament times Thyatira was famed
      for its dyers (Acts 16:14). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000800.html&amp;from=T0000868&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      COLOUR</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001101"><b>Eagle -</b> (Herb. nesher; properly
      the griffon vulture or great vulture, so called from its
      tearing its prey with its beak), referred to for its
      swiftness of flight (Deut. 28:49; 2 Sam. 1:23), its
      mounting high in the air (Job 39:27), its strength (Ps.
      103:5), its setting its nest in high places (Jer. 49:16),
      and its power of vision (Job 39:27-30).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This &quot;ravenous bird&quot; is a symbol of those nations
      whom God employs and sends forth to do a work of
      destruction, sweeping away whatever is decaying and
      putrescent (Matt. 24:28; Isa. 46:11; Ezek. 39:4; Deut.
      28:49; Jer. 4:13; 48:40). It is said that the eagle sheds
      his feathers in the beginning of spring, and with fresh
      plumage assumes the appearance of youth. To this, allusion
      is made in Ps. 103:5 and Isa. 40:31. God&#39;s care over
      his people is likened to that of the eagle in training its
      young to fly (Ex. 19:4; Deut. 32:11, 12). An interesting
      illustration is thus recorded by Sir Humphry Davy:, &quot;I
      once saw a very interesting sight above the crags of Ben
      Nevis. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two
      young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising
      from the top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was
      about mid-day, and bright for the climate. They at first
      made small circles, and the young birds imitated them. They
      paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their
      flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always
      rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight
      so as to make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones
      still and slowly followed, apparently flying better as they
      mounted; and they continued this sublime exercise, always
      rising till they became mere points in the air, and the
      young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our
      aching sight.&quot; (See Isa. 40:31.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been observed in Palestine four distinct species
      of eagles, (1) the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2)
      the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3) the common species,
      the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4) the Circaetos
      gallicus, which preys on reptiles. The eagle was unclean by
      the Levitical law (Lev. 11:13; Deut. 14:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001102"><b>Ear -</b> used frequently in a
      figurative sense (Ps. 34:15). To &quot;uncover the
      ear&quot; is to show respect to a person (1 Sam. 20:2
      marg.). To have the &quot;ear heavy&quot;, or to have
      &quot;uncircumcised ears&quot; (Isa. 6:10), is to be
      inattentive and disobedient. To have the ear
      &quot;bored&quot; through with an awl was a sign of
      perpetual servitude (Ex. 21:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001103"><b>Earing -</b> an Old English word
      (from the Latin aro, I plough), meaning
      &quot;ploughing.&quot; It is used in the Authorized Version
      in Gen. 45:6; Ex. 34:21; 1 Sam. 8:12; Deut. 21:4; Isa.
      30:24; but the Revised Version has rendered the original in
      these places by the ordinary word to plough or till.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001104"><b>Earnest -</b> The Spirit is the
      earnest of the believer&#39;s destined inheritance (2 Cor.
      1:22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14). The word thus rendered is the same
      as that rendered &quot;pledge&quot; in Gen. 38:17-20;
      &quot;indeed, the Hebrew word has simply passed into the
      Greek and Latin languages, probably through commercial
      dealings with the Phoenicians, the great trading people of
      ancient days. Originally it meant no more than a pledge;
      but in common usage it came to denote that particular kind
      of pledge which is a part of the full price of an article
      paid in advance; and as it is joined with the figure of a
      seal when applied to the Spirit, it seems to be used by
      Paul in this specific sense.&quot; The Spirit&#39;s
      gracious presence and working in believers is a foretaste
      to them of the blessedness of heaven. God is graciously
      pleased to give not only pledges but foretastes of future
      blessedness.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001105"><b>Earrings -</b> rings properly for the
      ear (Gen. 35:4; Num. 31:50; Ezek. 16:12). In Gen. 24:47 the
      word means a nose-jewel, and is so rendered in the Revised
      Version. In Isa. 3:20 the Authorized Version has
      &quot;ear-rings,&quot; and the Revised Version
      &quot;amulets,&quot; which more correctly represents the
      original word (lehashim), which means incantations; charms,
      thus remedies against enchantment, worn either suspended
      from the neck or in the ears of females. Ear-rings were
      ornaments used by both sexes (Ex. 32:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001106"><b>Earth -</b> (1.) In the sense of soil
      or ground, the translation of the word <i>adamah&#39;</i>.
      In Gen. 9:20 &quot;husbandman&quot; is literally &quot;man
      of the ground or earth.&quot; Altars were to be built of
      earth (Ex. 20:24). Naaman asked for two mules&#39; burden
      of earth (2 Kings 5:17), under the superstitious notion
      that Jehovah, like the gods of the heathen, could be
      acceptably worshipped only on his own soil.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2). As the rendering of <i>&#39;erets</i>, it means the
      whole world (Gen. 1:2); the land as opposed to the sea
      (1:10). <i>Erets</i> also denotes a country (21:32); a plot
      of ground (23:15); the ground on which a man stands (33:3);
      the inhabitants of the earth (6:1; 11:1); all the world
      except Israel (2 Chr. 13:9). In the New Testament &quot;the
      earth&quot; denotes the land of Judea (Matt. 23:35); also
      things carnal in contrast with things heavenly (John 3:31;
      Col. 3:1, 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001107"><b>Earthquake -</b> mentioned among the
      extraordinary phenomena of Palestine (Ps. 18:7; comp. Hab.
      3:6; Nah. 1:5; Isa. 5:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first earthquake in Palestine of which we have any
      record happened in the reign of Ahab (1 Kings 19:11, 12).
      Another took place in the days of Uzziah, King of Judah
      (Zech. 14:5). The most memorable earthquake taking place in
      New Testament times happened at the crucifixion of our Lord
      (Matt. 27:54). An earthquake at Philippi shook the prison
      in which Paul and Silas were imprisoned (Act 16:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is used figuratively as a token of the presence of the
      Lord (Judg. 5:4; 2 Sam. 22:8; Ps. 77:18; 97:4; 104:32).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001108"><b>East -</b> (1.) The orient (mizrah);
      the rising of the sun. Thus &quot;the east country&quot; is
      the country lying to the east of Syria, the Elymais (Zech.
      8:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2). Properly what is in front of one, or a country that is
      before or in front of another; the rendering of the word
      <i>kedem</i>. In pointing out the quarters, a Hebrew always
      looked with his face toward the east. The word <i>kedem</i>
      is used when the four quarters of the world are described
      (Gen. 13:14; 28:14); and <i>mizrah</i> when the east only
      is distinguished from the west (Josh. 11:3; Ps. 50:1;
      103:12, etc.). In Gen. 25:6 &quot;eastward&quot; is
      literally &quot;unto the land of kedem;&quot; i.e., the
      lands lying east of Palestine, namely, Arabia, Mesopotamia,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001109"><b>East, Children of the -</b> the Arabs
      as a whole, known as the Nabateans or Kedarenes, nomad
      tribes (Judg. 6:3,33; 7:12; 8:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001110"><b>Easter -</b> originally a Saxon word
      (Eostre), denoting a goddess of the Saxons, in honour of
      whom sacrifices were offered about the time of the
      Passover. Hence the name came to be given to the festival
      of the Resurrection of Christ, which occured at the time of
      the Passover. In the early English versions this word was
      frequently used as the translation of the Greek pascha (the
      Passover). When the Authorized Version (1611) was formed,
      the word &quot;passover&quot; was used in all passages in
      which this word pascha occurred, except in Act 12:4. In the
      Revised Version the proper word, &quot;passover,&quot; is
      always used.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001111"><b>East gate -</b> (Jer. 19:2), properly
      the Potter&#39;s gate, the gate which led to the
      potter&#39;s field, in the valley of Hinnom.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001112"><b>East sea -</b> (Joel 2:20; Ezek.
      47:18), the Dead Sea, which lay on the east side of the
      Holy Land. The Mediterranean, which lay on the west, was
      hence called the &quot;great sea for the west border&quot;
      (Num. 34:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001113"><b>East wind -</b> the wind coming from
      the east (Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8, etc.). Blight caused by
      this wind, &quot;thin ears&quot; (Gen. 41:6); the withered
      &quot;gourd&quot; (Jonah 4: 8). It was the cause and also
      the emblem of evil (Ezek. 17:10; 19:12; Hos. 13:15). In
      Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence
      is destitute of moisture necessary for vegetation.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001114"><b>Eating -</b> The ancient Hebrews
      would not eat with the Egyptians (Gen. 43:32). In the time
      of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans (John 4:9),
      and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners
      (Matt. 9:11). The Hebrews originally sat at table, but
      afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean practice of
      reclining (Luke 7:36-50). Their principal meal was at noon
      (Gen. 43:16; 1 Kings 20:16; Ruth 2:14; Luke 14:12). The
      word &quot;eat&quot; is used metaphorically in Jer. 15:16;
      Ezek. 3:1; Rev. 10:9. In John 6:53-58, &quot;eating and
      drinking&quot; means believing in Christ. Women were never
      present as guests at meals (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001115"><b>Ebal -</b> stony. (1.) A mountain
      3,076 feet above the level of the sea, and 1,200 feet above
      the level of the valley, on the north side of which stood
      the city of Shechem (q.v.). On this mountain six of the
      tribes (Deut. 27:12,13) were appointed to take their stand
      and respond according to a prescribed form to the
      imprecations uttered in the valley, where the law was read
      by the Levites (11:29; 29:4, 13). This mountain was also
      the site of the first great altar erected to Jehovah (Deut.
      27:5-8; Josh. 8:30-35). After this the name of Ebal does
      not again occur in Jewish history. (See <a href=

    </p>
    <p>

      (Gen. 10:28).

    <p>
      (3.) A descendant of Seir the Horite (Gen. 36:23).

      in whom the men of Shechem &quot;put confidence&quot; in
      their conspiracy against Abimelech (Judg. 9:26, 26, 30,
      31).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001117"><b>Ebed-melech -</b> a servant of the
      king; probably an official title, an Ethiopian, &quot;one
      of the eunuchs which was in the king&#39;s house;&quot;
      i.e., in the palace of Zedekiah, king of Judah. He
      interceded with the king in Jeremiah&#39;s behalf, and was
      the means of saving him from death by famine (Jer. 38:7-13:
      comp. 39:15-18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001118"><b>Eben-ezer -</b> stone of help, the
      memorial stone set up by Samuel to commemorate the divine
      assistance to Israel in their great battle against the
      Philistines, whom they totally routed (1 Sam. 7:7-12) at
      Aphek, in the neighbourhood of Mizpeh, in Benjamin, near
      the western entrance of the pass of Beth-horon. On this
      very battle-field, twenty years before, the Philistines
      routed the Israelites, &quot;and slew of the army in the
      field about four thousand men&quot; (4:1,2; here, and at
      5:1, called &quot;Eben-ezer&quot; by anticipation). In this
      extremity the Israelites fetched the ark out of Shiloh and
      carried it into their camp. The Philistines a second time
      immediately attacked them, and smote them with a very great
      slaughter, &quot;for there fell of Israel thirty thousand
      footmen. And the ark of God was taken&quot; (1 Sam. 4:10).
      And now in the same place the Philistines are vanquished,
      and the memorial stone is erected by Samuel (q.v.). The
      spot where the stone was erected was somewhere
      &quot;between Mizpeh and Shen.&quot; Some have identified
      it with the modern Beit Iksa, a conspicuous and prominent
      position, apparently answering all the necessary
      conditions; others with Dier Aban, 3 miles east of &#39;Ain
      Shems.</a>

      is regarded as the founder of the Hebrew race (10:21; Num.
      24:24). In Luke 3:35 he is called Heber.</a>

      (2.) One of the seven heads of the families of the Gadites

      rendering of the Hebrew <i>Koheleth</i>, which means
      &quot;Preacher.&quot; The old and traditional view of the
      authorship of this book attributes it to Solomon. This view
      can be satisfactorily maintained, though others date it
      from the Captivity. The writer represents himself
      implicitly as Solomon (1:12). It has been appropriately
      styled The Confession of King Solomon. &quot;The writer is
      a man who has sinned in giving way to selfishness and
      sensuality, who has paid the penalty of that sin in satiety
      and weariness of life, but who has through all this been
      under the discipline of a divine education, and has learned
      from it the lesson which God meant to teach him.&quot;
      &quot;The writer concludes by pointing out that the secret
      of a true life is that a man should consecrate the vigour
      of his youth to God.&quot; The key-note of the book is
      sounded in ch. 1:2,</a>

      in Amos 8:9; Micah 3:6; Zech. 14:6; Joel 2:10. Eclipses
      were regarded as tokens of God&#39;s anger (Joel 3:15; Job
      9:7). The darkness at the crucifixion has been ascribed to
      an eclipse (Matt. 27:45); but on the other hand it is
      argued that the great intensity of darkness caused by an
      eclipse never lasts for more than six minutes, and this
      darkness lasted for three hours. Moreover, at the time of
      the Passover the moon was full, and therefore there could
      not be an eclipse of the sun, which is caused by an
      interposition of the moon between the sun and the
      earth.</a>

      <a name="T0001125"><b>Ed -</b> witness, a word not found in
      the original Hebrew, nor in the LXX. and Vulgate, but added
      by the translators in the Authorized Version, also in the
      Revised Version, of Josh. 22:34. The words are literally
      rendered: &quot;And the children of Reuben and the children
      of Gad named the altar. It is a witness between us that
      Jehovah is God.&quot; This great altar stood probably on
      the east side of the Jordan, in the land of Gilead,
      &quot;over against the land of Canaan.&quot; After the
      division of the Promised Land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad
      and the half-tribe of Manasseh, on returning to their own
      settlements on the east of Jordan (Josh. 22:1-6), erected a
      great altar, which they affirmed, in answer to the
      challenge of the other tribes, was not for sacrifice, but
      only as a witness (&#39;Ed) or testimony to future
      generations that they still retained the same interest in
      the nation as the other tribes.</a>

      <a name="T0001126"><b>Edar -</b> tower of the flock, a
      tower between Bethlehem and Hebron, near which Jacob first
      halted after leaving Bethlehem (Gen. 35:21). In Micah 4:8
      the word is rendered &quot;tower of the flock&quot; (marg.,
      &quot;Edar&quot;), and is used as a designation of
      Bethlehem, which figuratively represents the royal line of
      David as sprung from Bethlehem.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001127"><b>Eden -</b> delight. (1.) The garden
      in which our first parents dewlt (Gen. 2:8-17). No
      geographical question has been so much discussed as that
      bearing on its site. It has been placed in Armenia, in the
      region west of the Caspian Sea, in Media, near Damascus, in
      Palestine, in Southern Arabia, and in Babylonia. The site
      must undoubtedly be sought for somewhere along the course
      of the great streams the Tigris and the Euphrates of
      Western Asia, in &quot;the land of Shinar&quot; or
      Babylonia. The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30&#39; to
      lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract,
      has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the
      probable site of Eden. &quot;It is a region where streams
      abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the
      Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single
      river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been
      a river of consequence.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among almost all nations there are traditions of the
      primitive innocence of our race in the garden of Eden. This
      was the &quot;golden age&quot; to which the Greeks looked
      back. Men then lived a &quot;life free from care, and
      without labour and sorrow. Old age was unknown; the body
      never lost its vigour; existence was a perpetual feast
      without a taint of evil. The earth brought forth
      spontaneously all things that were good in profuse
      abundance.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of the markets whence the merchants of Tyre
      obtained richly embroidered stuffs (Ezek. 27:23); the same,
      probably, as that mentioned in 2 Kings 19:12, and Isa.
      37:12, as the name of a region conquered by the Assyrians.

      called Edom&quot;, i.e., Red.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Idumea (Isa. 34:5, 6; Ezek. 35:15). &quot;The field of
      Edom&quot; (Gen. 32:3), &quot;the land of Edom&quot; (Gen.
      36:16), was mountainous (Obad. 1:8, 9, 19, 21). It was
      called the land, or &quot;the mountain of Seir,&quot; the
      rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended
      from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to
      the foot of the Dead Sea (1 Kings 9:26), and contained,
      among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally
      known by the Greek name Petra (2 Kings 14:7). It is a wild
      and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old
      capital was Bozrah (Isa. 63:1). The early inhabitants of
      the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites
      (Deut. 2:12), between whom and the kings of Israel and
      Judah there was frequent war (2 Kings 8:20; 2 Chr. 28:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused
      permission to the Israelites to pass through their land
      (Num. 20:14-21), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude
      of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David (2
      Sam. 8:14; comp. 1 Kings 9:26), and afterwards by Amaziah
      (2 Chr. 25:11, 12). But they regained again their
      independence, and in later years, during the decline of the
      Jewish kingdom (2 Kings 16:6; R.V. marg.,
      &quot;Edomites&quot;), made war against Israel. They took
      part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured
      Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession
      of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length,
      however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power (Jer.
      27:3, 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many prophecies concerning Edom (Isa. 34:5, 6;
      Jer. 49:7-18; Ezek. 25:13; 35:1-15; Joel 3:19; Amos 1:11;
      Obad.; Mal. 1:3, 4) which have been remarkably fulfilled.
      The present desolate condition of that land is a standing
      testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an
      existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years,
      they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is
      forgotten for ever. In Petra, &quot;where kings kept their
      court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it
      is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in
      language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites
      of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from Gen. 36, that they
      afterwards intermarried with the conquered population.
      Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the
      Kenizzites (Gen. 36:11), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged
      (Josh. 15:17). The southern part of Edom was known as
      Teman.

    <p>
      <a name="T0001130"><b>Edrei -</b> mighty; strength. (1.)
      One of the chief towns of the kingdom of Bashan (Josh.
      12:4, 5). Here Og was defeated by the Israelites, and the
      strength of the Amorites broken (Num. 21:33-35). It
      subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time
      apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and
      outlaws (Josh. 13:31). It has been identified with the
      modern Edr&#39;a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the
      south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and
      Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr&#39;a are the
      most extensive in the Hauran. They are 3 miles in
      circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain;
      the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild
      region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in
      its modern aspect: &quot;Elevated about 20 feet above the
      plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the
      rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its
      impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws
      and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of
      Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress,
      about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth&quot;
      (Porter&#39;s Syria, etc.). Beneath this wonderful city
      there is also a subterranean city, hollowed out probably as
      a refuge for the population of the upper city in times of
      danger. (See <a href=

      scorpion, which is said to be very like an egg in its
      appearance, so much so as to be with difficulty at times
      distinguished from it. In Job 6:6 (&quot;the white of an
      egg&quot;) the word for egg (hallamuth&#39;) occurs nowhere
      else. It has been translated &quot;purslain&quot; (R.V.
      marg.), and the whole phrase &quot;purslain-broth&quot;,
      i.e., broth made of that herb, proverbial for its
      insipidity; and hence an insipid discourse. Job applies
      this expression to the speech of Eliphaz as being insipid

      the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any
      record, holds a place of great significance in
      Scripture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their
      original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars
      believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent
      excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was
      originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps
      belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of
      history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which
      the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the
      Semitic family of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern
      being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between
      Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament,
      Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, &quot;the
      fortified land&quot; (Isa. 19:6; 37: 25, where the A.V.
      mistranslates &quot;defence&quot; and &quot;besieged
      places&quot;); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros,
      the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or &quot;the land of the
      south&quot; (Isa. 11:11). But the whole country is
      generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim,
      &quot;the two Mazors.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote
      antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were
      united by Menes, the founder of the first historical
      dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what
      is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at
      Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph
      (Hos. 9:6) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer,
      &quot;the good place.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire,
      those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth
      Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of
      decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle
      Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth.
      The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the
      Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of
      the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo),
      one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle
      Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the
      Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over
      Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries,
      and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had
      their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the
      north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the
      Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The
      Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the
      hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth
      Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria
      were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the
      Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan,
      which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth
      Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of
      the Pharaoh took the title of &quot;Prince of Cush.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or
      Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state
      religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which
      was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god
      being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt
      led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated
      from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital,
      on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform
      tablets that have been found there represent his foreign
      correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself
      with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more
      especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party
      succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the
      capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners
      were driven out of the country, those that remained being
      reduced to serfdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The national triumph was marked by the rise of the
      Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we
      must see the &quot;new king, who knew not Joseph.&quot; His
      grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C.
      1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom,
      excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he
      built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The
      Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate
      successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost
      its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians
      from Libya and the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end;
      Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a
      Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of
      which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In
      one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of
      Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They
      must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it
      was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally
      lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by
      the Pulista, or Philistines.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married
      the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first
      Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of
      the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second
      Dynasty (1 Kings 11:40; 14:25, 26). A list of the places he
      captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the
      south wall of the temple of Karnak.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians
      from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.
      The third of them was Tirhakah (2 Kings 19:9). In B.C. 674
      it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into
      twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his
      ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully
      revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the
      Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho (2
      Kings 23:29) and Hophra, or Apries (Jer. 37:5, 7, 11). The
      dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was
      subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized
      into a Persian satrapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the
      Egyptian Per-aa, or &quot;Great House,&quot; which may be
      compared to that of &quot;Sublime Porte.&quot; It is found
      in very early Egyptian texts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism
      and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of
      animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold
      deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and
      omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the
      animals as incarnations of the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of
      Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon,
      the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the
      other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of
      Heliopolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life,
      as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent
      on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was
      Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of
      evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was
      avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as
      their &quot;Redeemer.&quot; Osiris and Horus, along with
      Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing
      the sun-god under different forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and
      settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic
      period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen
      near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of
      Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to
      Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time
      after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or
      shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek
      Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this
      occurred before the time of the new king &quot;which knew
      not Joseph&quot; (Ex. 1:8). In later times Egypt was
      conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks
      under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the
      Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries.
      Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman
      Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands
      of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a
      part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the
      shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of
      Jacob to &quot;the land of Goshen&quot; occurred about 200
      years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of
      Egypt, invaded Palestine (1 Kings 14:25). He left a list of
      the cities he conquered.

      A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at
      Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important
      historical records ever found in connection with the Bible.
      They most fully confirm the historical statements of the
      Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in
      Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of
      Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay
      alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name
      of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and
      in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers
      are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no
      instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The
      tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating
      from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis
      III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and
      governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names
      of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of
      Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish (Josh. 10:3), and Jabin,
      king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to
      have come from the desert.

    <p>
      The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are
      these, Isa. 19; Jer. 43: 8-13; 44:30; 46; Ezek. 29-32; and
      it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably
      fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph
      (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of Jer. 46:19, Ezek. 30:13.

      bands with those of the Ammonites and the Amalekites,
      crossed the Jordan and took the city of Jericho, and for
      eighteen years held that whole district in subjection,
      exacting from it an annual tribute. At length Ehud, by a
      stratagem, put Eglon to death with a two-edged dagger a
      cubit long, and routed the Moabites at the fords of the
      Jordan, putting 10,000 of them to death. Thenceforward the
      land, at least Benjamin, enjoyed rest &quot;for fourscore
      years&quot; (Judg. 3:12-30). (See QUARRIES &macr;T0003032
      [2].) But in the south-west the Philistines reduced the
      Israelites to great straits (Judg. 5:6). From this

      came again into the full possession of the Philistines (1

      carried the ark before they sent it back to Israel (1 Sam.

      (Gen. 10:22), and the name of the country inhabited by his

      east of Babylonia, and extending to the shore of the
      Mediterranean, a distance in a direct line of about 1,000
      miles. The name Elam is an Assyrian word meaning
      &quot;high.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The inhabitants of Elam, or &#39;the Highlands,&#39;
      to the east of Babylon, were called Elamites. They were
      divided into several branches, speaking different dialects
      of the same agglutinative language. The race to which they
      belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the
      pre-Semitic Sumerians of Babylonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been that
      of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the
      time of Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already
      become the capital of the country. Babylonia was frequently
      invaded by the Elamite kings, who at times asserted their
      supremacy over it (as in the case of Chedorlaomer, the
      Kudur-Lagamar, or &#39;servant of the goddess Lagamar,&#39;
      of the cuneiform texts).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The later Assyrian monarchs made several campaigns
      against Elam, and finally Assur-bani-pal (about B.C. 650)
      succeeded in conquering the country, which was ravaged with
      fire and sword. On the fall of the Assyrian Empire, Elam
      passed into the hands of the Persians&quot; (A.H. Sayce).

      to administer justice among the people. He, with Medad,
      prophesied in the camp instead of going with the rest to
      the tabernacle, as Moses had commanded. This incident was
      announced to Moses by Joshua, who thought their conduct in
      this respect irregular. Moses replied, &quot;Enviest thou
      for my sake? would God that all the Lord&#39;s people were
      prophets&quot; (Num. 11:24-30; comp. Mark 9:38; Luke
      9:49).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001146"><b>Elder -</b> a name frequently used in
      the Old Testament as denoting a person clothed with
      authority, and entitled to respect and reverence (Gen.
      50:7). It also denoted a political office (Num. 22:7). The
      &quot;elders of Israel&quot; held a rank among the people
      indicative of authority. Moses opened his commission to
      them (Ex. 3:16). They attended Moses on all important
      occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of
      the law (Ex. 24:1). Seventy also were selected from the
      whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people
      (Num. 11:16, 17). The &quot;elder&quot; is the keystone of
      the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal
      system exists. At the present day this is the case among
      the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., &quot;the old man&quot;)
      is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the
      &quot;elders&quot; of Israel were the representatives of
      the people from the very first, and were recognized as such
      by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find
      mention made of the elders as exercising authority among
      the people. They appear as governors (Deut. 31:28), as
      local magistrates (16:18), administering justice (19:12).
      They were men of extensive influence (1 Sam. 30:26-31). In
      New Testament times they also appear taking an active part
      in public affairs (Matt. 16:21; 21:23; 26:59).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jewish eldership was transferred from the old
      dispensation to the new. &quot;The creation of the office
      of elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in
      the case of deacons and apostles, because the latter
      offices were created to meet new and special emergencies,
      while the former was transmitted from the earlies times. In
      other words, the office of elder was the only permanent
      essential office of the church under either
      dispensation.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;elders&quot; of the New Testament church were the
      &quot;pastors&quot; (Eph. 4:11), &quot;bishops or
      overseers&quot; (Acts 20:28), &quot;leaders&quot; and
      &quot;rulers&quot; (Heb. 13:7; 1 Thess. 5:12) of the flock.
      Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are
      titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian
      church. He who is called presbyter or elder on account of
      his age or gravity is also called bishop or overseer with
      reference to the duty that lay upon him (Titus 1:5-7; Acts
      20:17-28; Phil. 1:1).

      The third son of Aaron (Ex. 6:23). His wife, a daughter of
      Putiel, bore him Phinehas (Ex. 6:25). After the death of
      Nadab and Abihu (Lev. 10:12; Num. 3:4) he was appointed to
      the charge of the sanctuary (Num. 3:32). On Mount Hor he
      was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took
      from off his brother Aaron and put upon him as successor to
      his father in the high priest&#39;s office, which he held
      for more than twenty years (Num. 20:25-29). He took part
      with Moses in numbering the people (26:3, 4), and assisted
      at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the
      distribution of the land after the conquest (Josh. 14:1).
      The high-priesthood remained in his family till the time of
      Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was restored to
      the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok (1 Sam. 2:35;
      comp. 1 Kings 2:27). &quot;And Eleazar the son of Aaron
      died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to
      Phinehas his son&quot; (Josh. 24:33). The word here
      rendered &quot;hill&quot; is Gibeah, the name of several
      towns in Palestine which were generally on or near a hill.
      The words may be more suitably rendered, &quot;They buried
      him in Gibeah of Phinehas&quot;, i.e., in the city of
      Phinehas, which has been identified, in accordance with
      Jewish and Samaritan traditions, with Kefr
      Ghuweirah=&#39;Awertah, about 7 miles north of Shiloh, and
      a few miles south-east of Nablus. &quot;His tomb is still
      shown there, overshadowed by venerable terebinths.&quot;

      Gaba or Gebena of Eusebius, the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5
      miles north of Guphna towards Nablus.</a>

      <a name="T0001149"><b>Election of Grace -</b> The Scripture
      speaks (1) of the election of individuals to office or to
      honour and privilege, e.g., Abraham, Jacob, Saul, David,
      Solomon, were all chosen by God for the positions they
      held; so also were the apostles. (2) There is also an
      election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the
      Hebrews (Deut. 7:6; Rom. 9:4). (3) But in addition there is
      an election of individuals to eternal life (2 Thess. 2:13;
      Eph. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:2; John 13:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground of this election to salvation is the good
      pleasure of God (Eph. 1:5, 11; Matt. 11:25, 26; John 15:16,
      19). God claims the right so to do (Rom. 9:16, 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not conditioned on faith or repentance, but is of
      soverign grace (Rom. 11:4-6; Eph. 1:3-6). All that pertain
      to salvation, the means (Eph. 2:8; 2 Thess. 2:13) as well
      as the end, are of God (Acts 5:31; 2 Tim. 2:25; 1 Cor.
      1:30; Eph. 2:5, 10). Faith and repentance and all other
      graces are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and
      regeneration is God&#39;s work, a &quot;new creature.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Men are elected &quot;to salvation,&quot; &quot;to the

      before him in love&quot; (2 Thess. 2:13; Gal. 4:4, 5; Eph.
      1:4). The ultimate end of election is the praise of
      God&#39;s grace (Eph. 1:6, 12). (See <a href=

      recorded that &quot;Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a
      Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath.&quot; The
      Revised Version here rightly omits the words &quot;the
      brother of.&quot; They were introduced in the Authorized
      Version to bring this passage into agreement with 1 Chr.
      20:5, where it is said that he &quot;slew Lahmi the brother
      of Goliath.&quot; Goliath the Gittite was killed by David
      (1 Sam. 17). The exploit of Elhanan took place late in
      David&#39;s reign.</a>

      <a name="T0001155"><b>Eli -</b> ascent, the high priest
      when the ark was at Shiloh (1 Sam. 1:3, 9). He was the
      first of the line of Ithamar, Aaron&#39;s fourth son (1
      Chr. 24:3; comp. 2 Sam. 8:17), who held that office. The
      office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar (1
      Kings 2:26, 27), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok,
      of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (35). He acted also
      as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson (1
      Sam. 4:18), and judged Israel for forty years.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted
      themselves, to the great disgust of the people (1 Sam.
      2:27-36). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to
      reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so
      brought upon his house the judgment of God (2:22-33; 3:18).
      The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines,
      whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a
      short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of
      Israel. Four thousand of them fell in &quot;battle
      array&quot;. They now sought safety in having the &quot;ark
      of the covenant of the Lord&quot; among them. They fetched
      it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it.
      This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in
      Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary.
      The Philistines put themselves again in array against
      Israel, and in the battle which ensued &quot;Israel was
      smitten, and there was a very great slaughter.&quot; The
      tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to
      Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite
      from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the
      sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings
      from the battle-field. The full extent of the national
      calamity was speedily made known to him: &quot;Israel is
      fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great
      slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and
      Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken&quot; (1
      Sam. 4:12-18). When the old man, whose eyes were
      &quot;stiffened&quot; (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye
      unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of
      woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being
      ninety and eight years old. (See <a href=

      (1.) &quot;The Tishbite,&quot; the &quot;Elias&quot; of the
      New Testament, is suddenly introduced to our notice in 1
      Kings 17:1 as delivering a message from the Lord to Ahab.
      There is mention made of a town called Thisbe, south of
      Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the
      place referred to in the name given to the prophet.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered his message to Ahab, he retired at the
      command of God to a hiding-place by the brook Cherith,
      beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the brook
      dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of
      Zidon, from whose scanty store he was supported for the
      space of two years. During this period the widow&#39;s son
      died, and was restored to life by Elijah (1 Kings 17:
      2-24).
    </p>
    <p>
      During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land.
      At the close of this period of retirement and of
      preparation for his work (comp. Gal. 1:17, 18) Elijah met
      Obadiah, one of Ahab&#39;s officers, whom he had sent out
      to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and
      tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and
      met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel.
      It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly
      offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or
      Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with
      the result that the people fell on their faces, crying,
      &quot;The Lord, he is the God.&quot; Thus was accomplished
      the great work of Elijah&#39;s ministry. The prophets of
      Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one
      of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according
      to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer (James
      5:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests
      of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death (1 Kings
      19:1-13). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and
      thence went alone a day&#39;s journey into the wilderness,
      and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he
      slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, &quot;Arise
      and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.&quot;
      He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having
      partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he
      went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty
      nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his
      abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said,
      &quot;What dost thou here, Elijah?&quot; In answer to his
      despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then
      directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king
      over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be
      prophet in his room (1 Kings 19:13-21; comp. 2 Kings
      8:7-15; 9:1-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the
      violent deaths they would die (1 Kings 21:19-24; 22:38). He
      also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had
      succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death (2
      Kings 1:1-16). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002600.html&amp;from=T0002645&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      NABOTH</a>.) During these intervals he probably withdrew to
      some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview
      with Ahaziah&#39;s messengers on the way to Ekron, and the
      account of the destruction of his captains with their
      fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in
      retirement at this time on Mount Carmel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into
      heaven (2 Kings 2:1-12). He had a presentiment of what was
      awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of
      the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had
      anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized
      by the thought of his master&#39;s leaving him, and refused
      to be parted from him. &quot;They two went on,&quot; and
      came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the
      waters of which were &quot;divided hither and thither&quot;
      when smitten with Elijah&#39;s mantle. Arrived at the
      borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before,
      it &quot;came to pass as they still went on and
      talked&quot; they were suddenly separated by a chariot and
      horses of fire; and &quot;Elijah went up by a whirlwind
      into heaven, &quot;Elisha receiving his mantle, which fell
      from him as he ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in
      the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the
      Baptist (John 1:25), &quot;Why baptizest thou, if thou be
      not that Christ, nor Elias?&quot; Paul (Rom. 11:2) refers
      to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument
      that God had not cast away his people. James (5:17) finds
      in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (See also
      Luke 4:25; 9:54.) He was a type of John the Baptist in the
      sternness and power of his reproofs (Luke 9:8). He was the
      Elijah that &quot;must first come&quot; (Matt. 11:11, 14),
      the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even
      outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the
      earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In
      him we see &quot;the same connection with a wild and
      wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert;
      the same sudden, startling entrance on his work (1 Kings
      17:1; Luke 3:2); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and
      a leathern girdle about the loins (2 Kings 1:8; Matt.
      3:4).&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      How deep the impression was which Elijah made &quot;on the
      mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief,
      which rested on the words of Malachi (4:5, 6), which many
      centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for
      the relief and restoration of the country. Each remarkable
      person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and
      characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with
      his gentle Successor, is proclaimed to be Elijah (Matt.
      11:13, 14; 16:14; 17:10; Mark 9:11; 15:35; Luke 9:7, 8;
      John 1:21). His appearance in glory on the mount of
      transfiguration does not seem to have startled the
      disciples. They were &#39;sore afraid,&#39; but not
      apparently surprised.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The Elijah spoken of in 2 Chr. 21:12-15 is by some
      supposed to be a different person from the foregoing. He
      lived in the time of Jehoram, to whom he sent a letter of
      warning (comp. 1 Chr. 28:19; Jer. 36), and acted as a
      prophet in Judah; while the Tishbite was a prophet of the
      northern kingdom. But there does not seem any necessity for
      concluding that the writer of this letter was some other
      Elijah than the Tishbite. It may be supposed either that
      Elijah anticipated the character of Jehoram, and so wrote
      the warning message, which was preserved in the schools of
      the prophets till Jehoram ascended the throne after the
      Tishbite&#39;s translation, or that the translation did not
      actually take place till after the accession of Jehoram to
      the throne (2 Chr. 21:12; 2 Kings 8:16). The events of 2
      Kings 2 may not be recorded in chronological order, and
      thus there may be room for the opinion that Elijah was
      still alive in the beginning of Jehoram&#39;s reign.

      One of Job&#39;s &quot;three friends&quot; who visited him
      in his affliction (4:1). He was a &quot;Temanite&quot;,
      i.e., a native of Teman, in Idumea. He first enters into
      debate with Job. His language is uniformly more delicate
      and gentle than that of the other two, although he imputes
      to Job special sins as the cause of his present sufferings.
      He states with remarkable force of language the infinite
      purity and majesty of God (4:12-21; 15:12-16).</a>

      <a name="T0001176"><b>Elisabeth -</b> God her oath, the
      mother of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5). She was a descendant
      of Aaron. She and her husband Zacharias (q.v.) &quot;were
      both righteous before God&quot; (Luke 1:5, 13). Mary&#39;s
      visit to Elisabeth is described in 1:39-63.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001177"><b>Elisha -</b> God his salvation, the
      son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, who became the attendant
      and disciple of Elijah (1 Kings 19:16-19). His name first
      occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his
      successor (1 Kings 19:16). This was the only one of the
      three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished.
      On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his
      native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing
      with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over
      his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as
      a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (comp.
      Luke 9:61, 62). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about
      four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or
      eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he
      was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all
      these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection
      with the closing scenes of Elijah&#39;s life. After Elijah,
      Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the
      prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed,
      according to his own request, &quot;a double portion&quot;
      of Elijah&#39;s spirit (2 Kings 2:9); and for the long
      period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office
      of &quot;prophet in Israel&quot; (2 Kings 5:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After Elijah&#39;s departure, Elisha returned to Jericho,
      and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into
      it (2 Kings 2:21). We next find him at Bethel (2:23),
      where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the
      youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God:
      &quot;Go up, thou bald head.&quot; The judgment at once
      took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to
      his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of
      his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was
      faint from thirst (2 Kings 3:9-20); of the multiplying of
      the poor widow&#39;s cruse of oil (4:1-7); the miracle of
      restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (4:18-37);
      the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into
      a sufficient supply for an hundred men (4:42-44); of the
      cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (5:1-27); of the
      punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his
      covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters
      of the Jordan (6:1-7); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way
      on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of
      Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible
      sufferings of the people in connection with it, and
      Elisha&#39;s prophecy as to the relief that would come (2
      Kings 6:24-7:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command
      given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria (2
      Kings 8:7-15); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the
      prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of
      Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to
      Elijah (9:1-10) were at length carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not again read of him till we find him on his
      death-bed in his own house (2 Kings 13:14-19). Joash, the
      grandson of Jehu, comes to mourn over his approaching
      departure, and utters the same words as those of Elisha
      when Elijah was taken away: &quot;My father, my father! the
      chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards when a dead body is laid in Elisha&#39;s grave a
      year after his burial, no sooner does it touch the hallowed
      remains than the man &quot;revived, and stood up on his
      feet&quot; (2 Kings 13:20-21).

      (1 Sam. 1:1, 4, 8), but lived at Ramah, a man of wealth and

      half-way between Ur (now Mugheir) and Erech, on the left

      preserving a body by means of aromatics (Gen. 50:2, 3, 26).
      This art was practised by the Egyptians from the earliest
      times, and there brought to great perfection. This custom
      probably originated in the belief in the future reunion of
      the soul with the body. The process became more and more
      complicated, and to such perfection was it carried that
      bodies embalmed thousands of years ago are preserved to the
      present day in the numberless mummies that have been
      discovered in Egypt.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The embalming of Jacob and Joseph was according to the
      Egyptian custom, which was partially followed by the Jews
      (2 Chr. 16:14), as in the case of king Asa, and of our Lord
      (John 19:39, 40; Luke 23:56; 24:1). (See <a href=

      Ps. 45:14). The skill of the women in this art was seen in
      the preparation of the sacerdotal robes of the high priest
      (Ex. 28). It seems that the art became hereditary in
      certain families (1 Chr. 4:21). The Assyrians were also

      priest. It is mentioned (Rev. 21:19) as one of the

      of his resurrection (Luke 24:13). This has been identified
      with the modern el-Kubeibeh, lying over 7 miles north-west
      of Jerusalem. This name, el-Kubeibeh, meaning &quot;little
      dome,&quot; is derived from the remains of the
      Crusaders&#39; church yet to be found there. Others have
      identified it with the modern Khurbet Khamasa i.e.,
      &quot;the ruins of Khamasa&quot;, about 8 miles south-west
      of Jerusalem, where there are ruins also of a
