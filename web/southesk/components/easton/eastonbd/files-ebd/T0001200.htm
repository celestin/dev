      HAMOR</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001201"><b>Encamp -</b> An encampment was the
      resting-place for a longer or shorter period of an army or
      company of travellers (Ex. 13:20; 14:19; Josh. 10:5;
      11:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which the Israelites encamped during their
      march through the wilderness is described in Num. 2 and 3.
      The order of the encampment (see CAMP &macr;T0000700) was
      preserved in the march (Num. 2:17), the signal for which
      was the blast of two silver trumpets. Detailed regulations
      affecting the camp for sanitary purposes are given (Lev.
      4:11, 12; 6:11; 8:17; 10:4, 5; 13:46; 14:3; Num. 12:14, 15;
      31:19; Deut. 23:10, 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Criminals were executed without the camp (Lev. 4:12; comp.
      John 19:17, 20), and there also the young bullock for a
      sin-offering was burnt (Lev. 24:14; comp. Heb. 13:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the subsequent history of Israel frequent mention is
      made of their encampments in the time of war (Judg. 7:18; 1
      Sam. 13:2, 3, 16, 23; 17:3; 29:1; 30:9, 24). The temple was
      sometimes called &quot;the camp of the Lord&quot; (2 Chr.
      31:2, R.V.; comp. Ps. 78:28). The multitudes who flocked to
      David are styled &quot;a great host (i.e.,
      &quot;camp;&quot; Heb. mahaneh), like the host of God&quot;
      (1 Chr. 12:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001202"><b>Enchantments -</b> (1.) The rendering
      of Hebrew <i>latim_ or _lehatim</i>, which means
      &quot;something covered,&quot; &quot;muffled up;&quot;
      secret arts, tricks (Ex. 7:11, 22; 8:7, 18), by which the
      Egyptian magicians imposed on the credulity of Pharaoh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The rendering of the Hebrew <i>keshaphim</i>,
      &quot;muttered spells&quot; or &quot;incantations,&quot;
      rendered &quot;sorceries&quot; in Isa. 47:9, 12, i.e., the
      using of certain formulae under the belief that men could
      thus be bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Hebrew <i>lehashim</i>, &quot;charming,&quot; as of
      serpents (Jer. 8:17; comp. Ps. 58:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Hebrew <i>nehashim</i>, the enchantments or omens used
      by Balaam (Num. 24:1); his endeavouring to gain omens
      favourable to his design.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Hebrew <i>heber</i> (Isa. 47:9, 12), &quot;magical
      spells.&quot; All kinds of enchantments were condemned by
      the Mosaic law (Lev. 19:26; Deut. 18:10-12). (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0001203"><b>End -</b> in Heb. 13:7, is the
      rendering of the unusual Greek word <i>ekbasin</i>, meaning
      &quot;outcome&quot;, i.e., death. It occurs only elsewhere
      in 1 Cor. 10:13, where it is rendered
      &quot;escape.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001204"><b>Endor -</b> fountain of Dor; i.e.,
      &quot;of the age&quot;, a place in the territory of
      Issachar (Josh. 17:11) near the scene of the great victory
      which was gained by Deborah and Barak over Sisera and Jabin
      (comp. Ps. 83:9, 10). To Endor, Saul resorted to consult
      one reputed to be a witch on the eve of his last engagement
      with the Philistines (1 Sam. 28:7). It is identified with
      the modern village of Endur, &quot;a dirty hamlet of some
      twenty houses, or rather huts, most of them falling to
      ruin,&quot; on the northern slope of Little Hermon, about 7
      miles from Jezreel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001205"><b>En-eglaim -</b> fountain of two
      calves, a place mentioned only in Ezek. 47:10. Somewhere
      near the Dead Sea.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001206"><b>En-gannim -</b> fountain of gardens.
      (1.) A town in the plains of Judah (Josh. 15:34),
      north-west of Jerusalem, between Zanoah and Tappuah. It is
      the modern Umm Jina.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A city on the border of Machar (Josh. 19:21), allotted
      to the Gershonite Levites (21:29). It is identified with
      the modern Jenin, a large and prosperous town of about
      4,000 inhabitants, situated 15 miles south of Mount Tabor,
      through which the road from Jezreel to Samaria and
      Jerusalem passes. When Ahaziah, king of Judah, attempted to
      escape from Jehu, he &quot;fled by the way of the garden
      house&quot; i.e., by way of En-gannim. Here he was
      overtaken by Jehu and wounded in his chariot, and turned
      aside and fled to Megiddo, a distance of about 20 miles, to
      die there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001207"><b>Engedi -</b> fountain of the kid,
      place in the wilderness of Judah (Josh. 15:62), on the
      western shore of the Dead Sea (Ezek. 47:10), and nearly
      equidistant from both extremities. To the wilderness near
      this town David fled for fear of Saul (Josh. 15:62; 1 Sam.
      23:29). It was at first called Hazezon-tamar (Gen. 14:7), a
      city of the Amorites.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The vineyards of Engedi were celebrated in Solomon&#39;s
      time (Cant. 1:4). It is the modern &#39;Ain Jidy. The
      &quot;fountain&quot; from which it derives its name rises
      on the mountain side about 600 feet above the sea, and in
      its rapid descent spreads luxuriance all around it. Along
      its banks the osher grows abundantly. That shrub is thus
      described by Porter: &quot;The stem is stout, measuring
      sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to
      the height of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and
      long oval leaves, which when broken off discharge a milky
      fluid. The fruit resembles an apple, and hangs in clusters
      of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow colour,
      but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball. It is
      chiefly filled with air...This is the so-called &#39;apple
      of Sodom.&#39;&quot; Through Samaria, etc. (See <a href=

      APPLE</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001208"><b>Engines -</b> (1.) Heb. hishalon
      i.e., &quot;invention&quot; (as in Eccl. 7:29) contrivances
      indicating ingenuity. In 2 Chr. 26:15 it refers to
      inventions for the purpose of propelling missiles from the
      walls of a town, such as stones (the Roman balista) and
      arrows (the catapulta).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. mechi kobollo, i.e., the beating of that which is
      in front a battering-ram (Ezek. 26:9), the use of which was
      common among the Egyptians and the Assyrians. Such an
      engine is mentioned in the reign of David (2 Sam. 20:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001209"><b>Engraver -</b> Heb. harash (Ex.
      35:35; 38:23) means properly an artificer in wood, stone,
      or metal. The chief business of the engraver was cutting
      names or devices on rings and seals and signets (Ex. 28:11,
      21, 36; Gen. 38:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001210"><b>En-hakkore -</b> fountain of the
      crier, the name of the spring in Lehi which burst forth in
      answer to Samson&#39;s prayer when he was exhausted with
      the slaughter of the Philistines (Judg. 15:19). It has been
      identified with the spring &#39;Ayun Kara, near Zoreah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001211"><b>Enmity -</b> deep-rooted hatred.
      &quot;I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between
      thy seed and her seed&quot; (Gen. 3:15). The friendship of
      the world is &quot;enmity with God&quot; (James 4:4; 1 John
      2:15, 16). The &quot;carnal mind&quot; is &quot;enmity
      against God&quot; (Rom. 8:7). By the abrogation of the
      Mosaic institutes the &quot;enmity&quot; between Jew and
      Gentile is removed. They are reconciled, are &quot;made
      one&quot; (Eph. 2:15, 16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001212"><b>Enoch -</b> initiated. (1.) The
      eldest son of Cain (Gen. 4:17), who built a city east of
      Eden in the land of Nod, and called it &quot;after the name
      of his son Enoch.&quot; This is the first &quot;city&quot;
      mentioned in Scripture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son of Jared, and father of Methuselah (Gen. 5:21;
      Luke 3:37). His father was one hundred and sixty-two years
      old when he was born. After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch
      &quot;walked with God three hundred years&quot; (Gen.
      5:22-24), when he was translated without tasting death. His
      whole life on earth was three hundred and sixty-five years.
      He was the &quot;seventh from Adam&quot; (Jude 1:14), as
      distinguished from the son of Cain, the third from Adam. He
      is spoken of in the catalogue of Old Testament worthies in
      the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:5). When he was translated,
      only Adam, so far as recorded, had as yet died a natural
      death, and Noah was not yet born. Mention is made of
      Enoch&#39;s prophesying only in Jude 1:14.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001213"><b>Enos -</b> man the son of Seth, and
      grandson of Adam (Gen. 5:6-11; Luke 3:38). He lived nine
      hundred and five years. In his time &quot;men began to call
      upon the name of the Lord&quot; (Gen. 4:26), meaning either
      (1) then began men to call themselves by the name of the
      Lord (marg.) i.e., to distinguish themselves thereby from
      idolaters; or (2) then men in some public and earnest way
      began to call upon the Lord, indicating a time of spiritual
      revival.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001214"><b>En-rogel -</b> fountain of the
      treaders; i.e., &quot;foot-fountain;&quot; also called the
      &quot;fullers&#39; fountain,&quot; because fullers here
      trod the clothes in water. It has been identified with the
      &quot;fountain of the virgin&quot; (q.v.), the modern
      &#39;Ain Ummel-Daraj. Others identify it, with perhaps some
      probability, with the Bir Eyub, to the south of the Pool of
      Siloam, and below the junction of the valleys of Kidron and
      Hinnom. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001300.html&amp;from=T0001378&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      FOUNTAIN</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this fountain that Jonathan and Ahimaaz lay hid
      after the flight of David (2 Sam. 17:17); and here also
      Adonijah held the feast when he aspired to the throne of
      his father (1 Kings 1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bir Eyub, or &quot;Joab&#39;s well,&quot; &quot;is a
      singular work of ancient enterprise. The shaft sunk through
      the solid rock in the bed of the Kidron is 125 feet
      deep...The water is pure and entirely sweet, quite
      different from that of Siloam; which proves that there is
      no connection between them.&quot; Thomson&#39;s Land and
      the Book.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001215"><b>En-shemesh -</b> fountain of the sun
      a spring which formed one of the landmarks on the boundary
      between Judah and Benjamin (Josh. 15:7; 18:17). It was
      between the &quot;ascent of Adummim&quot; and the spring of
      En-rogel, and hence was on the east of Jerusalem and of the
      Mount of Olives. It is the modern &#39;Ain-Haud i.e., the
      &quot;well of the apostles&quot; about a mile east of
      Bethany, the only spring on the road to Jericho. The sun
      shines on it the whole day long.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001216"><b>Ensign -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;oth, a
      military standard, especially of a single tribe (Num. 2:2).
      Each separate tribe had its own &quot;sign&quot; or
      &quot;ensign.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. nes, a lofty signal, as a column or high pole
      (Num. 21:8, 9); a standard or signal or flag placed on high
      mountains to point out to the people a place of rendezvous
      on the irruption of an enemy (Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 18:3;
      62:10; Jer. 4:6, 21; Ps. 60:4). This was an occasional
      signal, and not a military standard. Elevation and
      conspicuity are implied in the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The Hebrew word <i>degel</i> denotes the standard
      given to each of the four divisions of the host of the
      Israelites at the Exodus (Num. 1:52; 2:2; 10:14). In Cant.
      2:4 it is rendered &quot;banner.&quot; We have no definite
      information as to the nature of these military standards.

      festival (Deut. 16:11, 14), and accompanied by offerings (1
      Sam. 9:13), in token of alliances (Gen. 26:30); sometimes
      in connection with domestic or social events, as at the
      weaning of children (Gen. 21:8), at weddings (Gen. 29:22;
      John 2:1), on birth-days (Matt. 14:6), at the time of
      sheep-shearing (2 Sam. 13:23), and of vintage (Judg. 9:27),
      and at funerals (2 Sam. 3:35; Jer. 16:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were invited by servants (Prov. 9:3; Matt.
      22:3), who assigned them their respective places (1 Sam.
      9:22; Luke 14:8; Mark 12:39). Like portions were sent by
      the master to each guest (1 Sam. 1:4; 2 Sam. 6:19), except
      when special honour was intended, when the portion was
      increased (Gen. 43:34).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Israelites were forbidden to attend heathenish
      sacrificial entertainments (Ex. 34:15), because these were
      in honour of false gods, and because at such feast they
      would be liable to partake of unclean flesh (1 Cor. 10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the entertainments common in apostolic times among the
      Gentiles were frequent &quot;revellings,&quot; against
      which Christians were warned (Rom. 13:13; Gal. 5:21; 1 Pet.
      4:3). (See <a href=

      Achaia&quot; (R.V., &quot;of Asia&quot;, i.e., of
      proconsular Asia, which is probably the correct reading).
      As being the first convert in that region, he was

      Christ.&quot; He was thus evidently with him at Rome when
      he wrote to the Colossians. He was a distinguished
      disciple, and probably the founder of the Colossian church.
      He is also mentioned in the Epistle to Philemon (1:23),

    </p>
    <p>
      Contents of. The Epistle to the Colossians is mainly
      polemical, designed to refute certain theosophic errors
      that had crept into the church there. That to the Ephesians
      does not seem to have originated in any special
      circumstances, but is simply a letter springing from
      Paul&#39;s love to the church there, and indicative of his
      earnest desire that they should be fully instructed in the
      profound doctrines of the gospel. It contains (1) the
      salutation (1:1, 2); (2) a general description of the
      blessings the gospel reveals, as to their source, means by
      which they are attained, purpose for which they are
      bestowed, and their final result, with a fervent prayer for
      the further spiritual enrichment of the Ephesians
      (1:3-2:10); (3) &quot;a record of that marked change in
      spiritual position which the Gentile believers now
      possessed, ending with an account of the writer&#39;s
      selection to and qualification for the apostolate of
      heathendom, a fact so considered as to keep them from being
      dispirited, and to lead him to pray for enlarged spiritual
      benefactions on his absent sympathizers&quot; (2:12-3:21);
      (4) a chapter on unity as undisturbed by diversity of gifts
      (4:1-16); (5) special injunctions bearing on ordinary life
      (4:17-6:10); (6) the imagery of a spiritual warfare,
      mission of Tychicus, and valedictory blessing (6:11-24).

    <p>
      Planting of the church at Ephesus. Paul&#39;s first and
      hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is
      recorded in Acts 18:19-21. The work he began on this
      occasion was carried forward by Apollos (24-26) and Aquila
      and Priscilla. On his second visit, early in the following
      year, he remained at Ephesus &quot;three years,&quot; for
      he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia
      Minor. Here &quot;a great door and effectual&quot; was
      opened to him (1 Cor. 16:9), and the church was established
      and strengthened by his assiduous labours there (Acts
      20:20, 31). From Ephesus as a centre the gospel spread
      abroad &quot;almost throughout all Asia&quot; (19:26). The
      word &quot;mightily grew and prevailed&quot; despite all
      the opposition and persecution he encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his last journey to Jerusalem the apostle landed at
      Miletus, and summoning together the elders of the church
      from Ephesus, delivered to them his remarkable farewell
      charge (Acts 20:18-35), expecting to see them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following parallels between this epistle and the
      Milesian charge may be traced:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Acts 20:19 = Eph. 4:2. The phrase &quot;lowliness of
      mind&quot; occurs nowhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Acts 20:27 = Eph. 1:11. The word &quot;counsel,&quot;
      as denoting the divine plan, occurs only here and Heb.
      6:17.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Acts 20:32 = Eph. 3:20. The divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Acts 20:32 = Eph. 2:20. The building upon the
      foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Acts 20:32 = Eph. 1:14, 18. &quot;The inheritance of
      the saints.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Place and date of the writing of the letter. It was
      evidently written from Rome during Paul&#39;s first
      imprisonment (3:1; 4:1; 6:20), and probably soon after his
      arrival there, about the year 62, four years after he had
      parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. The
      subscription of this epistle is correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems to have been no special occasion for the
      writing of this letter, as already noted. Paul&#39;s object
      was plainly not polemical. No errors had sprung up in the
      church which he sought to point out and refute. The object
      of the apostle is &quot;to set forth the ground, the cause,
      and the aim and end of the church of the faithful in
      Christ. He speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of
      the church universal.&quot; The church&#39;s foundations,
      its course, and its end, are his theme. &quot;Everywhere
      the foundation of the church is the will of the Father; the
      course of the church is by the satisfaction of the Son; the
      end of the church is the life in the Holy Spirit.&quot; In
      the Epistle to the Romans, Paul writes from the point of
      view of justification by the imputed righteousness of
      Christ; here he writes from the point of view specially of
      union to the Redeemer, and hence of the oneness of the true
      church of Christ. &quot;This is perhaps the profoundest
      book in existence.&quot; It is a book &quot;which sounds
      the lowest depths of Christian doctrine, and scales the
      loftiest heights of Christian experience;&quot; and the
      fact that the apostle evidently expected the Ephesians to
      understand it is an evidence of the &quot;proficiency which
      Paul&#39;s converts had attained under his preaching at
      Ephesus.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Relation between this epistle and that to the Colossians
      (q.v.). &quot;The letters of the apostle are the fervent
      outburst of pastoral zeal and attachment, written without
      reserve and in unaffected simplicity; sentiments come warm
      from the heart, without the shaping out, pruning, and
      punctilious arrangement of a formal discourse. There is
      such a fresh and familiar transcription of feeling, so
      frequent an introduction of coloquial idiom, and so much of
      conversational frankness and vivacity, that the reader
      associates the image of the writer with every paragraph,
      and the ear seems to catch and recognize the very tones of
      living address.&quot; &quot;Is it then any matter of
      amazement that one letter should resemble another, or that
      two written about the same time should have so much in
      common and so much that is peculiar? The close relation as
      to style and subject between the epistles to Colosse and
      Ephesus must strike every reader. Their precise relation to
      each other has given rise to much discussion. The great
      probability is that the epistle to Colosse was first
      written; the parallel passages in Ephesians, which amount
      to about forty-two in number, having the appearance of
      being expansions from the epistle to Colosse. Compare:
    </p>
    <p>
      Eph 1:7; Col 1:14 Eph 1:10; Col 1:20 Eph 3:2; Col 1:25 Eph
      5:19; Col 3:16 Eph 6:22; Col 4:8 Eph 1:19-2:5; Col 2:12,13
      Eph 4:2-4; Col 3:12-15 Eph 4:16; Col 2:19 Eph 4:32; Col
      3:13 Eph 4:22-24; Col 3:9,10 Eph 5:6-8; Col 3:6-8 Eph
      5:15,16; Col 4:5 Eph 6:19,20; Col 4:3,4 Eph 5:22-6:9; Col
      3:18-4:1
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The style of this epistle is exceedingly animated,
      and corresponds with the state of the apostle&#39;s mind at
      the time of writing. Overjoyed with the account which their
      messenger had brought him of their faith and holiness (Eph.
      1:15), and transported with the consideration of the
      unsearchable wisdom of God displayed in the work of
      man&#39;s redemption, and of his astonishing love towards
      the Gentiles in making them partakers through faith of all
      the benefits of Christ&#39;s death, he soars high in his
      sentiments on those grand subjects, and gives his thoughts
      utterance in sublime and copious expression.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001225"><b>Ephesus -</b> the capital of
      proconsular Asia, which was the western part of Asia Minor.
      It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of
      the Romans it bore the title of &quot;the first and
      greatest metropolis of Asia.&quot; It was distinguished for
      the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine;
      and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world,
      capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all
      ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the
      fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Comp. 1 Cor.
      4:9; 9:24, 25; 15:32.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here
      the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after
      Pentecost (Acts 2:9; 6:9). At the close of his second
      missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning
      from Greece to Syria (18:18-21), he first visited this
      city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he
      was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at
      Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to
      carry on the work of spreading the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus
      from the &quot;upper coasts&quot; (Acts 19:1), i.e., from
      the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about
      three years; and so successful and abundant were his
      labours that &quot;all they which dwelt in Asia heard the
      word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks&quot; (19:10).
      Probably during this period the seven churches of the
      Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul&#39;s personal
      labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from
      Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to
      their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus,
      some 30 miles south of Ephesus (Acts 20:15), and sending
      for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he
      delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is
      recorded in Acts 20:18-35. Ephesus is not again mentioned
      till near the close of Paul&#39;s life, when he writes to
      Timothy exhorting him to &quot;abide still at Ephesus&quot;
      (1 Tim. 1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of Paul&#39;s companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were
      probably natives of Ephesus (Acts 20:4; 21:29; 2 Tim.
      4:12). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of
      Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus
      (2 Tim. 1:18). He also &quot;sent Tychicus to Ephesus&quot;
      (4:12), probably to attend to the interests of the church
      there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse (1:11;
      2:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years
      in Ephesus, where he died and was buried.

      A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied

      characteristic of his office (1 Sam. 2:18, 28; 14:3). It
      was worn by Samuel, and also by David (2 Sam. 6:14). It was
      made of fine linen, and consisted of two pieces, which hung
      from the neck, and covered both the back and front, above
      the tunic and outer garment (Ex. 28:31). That of the high
      priest was embroidered with divers colours. The two pieces
      were joined together over the shoulders (hence in Latin
      called superhumerale) by clasps or buckles of gold or
      precious stones, and fastened round the waist by a
      &quot;curious girdle of gold, blue, purple, and fine twined
      linen&quot; (28:6-12).</a>

      characteristics of Mark that he uses the very Aramaic words
      which fell from our Lord&#39;s lips. (See 3:17; 5:41; 7:11;

      (Gen. 41:52; 46:20). The first incident recorded regarding
      him is his being placed, along with his brother Manasseh,
      before their grandfather, Jacob, that he might bless them
      (48:10; comp. 27:1). The intention of Joseph was that the
      right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the
      head of the elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the
      younger before his brother, &quot;guiding his hands
      wittingly.&quot; Before Joseph&#39;s death, Ephraim&#39;s

      were conspiring against him. It lay in the wild,
      uncultivated hill-country to the north-east of Jerusalem,
      betwen the central towns and the Jordan valley.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001231"><b>Ephraim, Mount -</b> the central
      mountainous district of Palestine occupied by the tribe of
      Ephraim (Josh. 17:15; 19:50; 20:7), extending from Bethel
      to the plain of Jezreel. In Joshua&#39;s time (Josh. 17:18)
      these hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by
      well-watered, fertile valleys, referred to in Jer. 50:19.
      Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of
      Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash (Judg.
      2:9). This region is also called the &quot;mountains of
      Israel&quot; (Josh. 11:21) and the &quot;mountains of
      Samaria&quot; (Jer. 31:5, 6: Amos 3:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001232"><b>Ephraim, The tribe of -</b> took
      precedence over that of Manasseh by virtue of Jacob&#39;s
      blessing (Gen. 41:52; 48:1). The descendants of Joseph
      formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each of the
      other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus
      there were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number
      twelve was preserved by excluding that of Levi when Ephraim
      and Manasseh are mentioned separately (Num. 1:32-34; Josh.
      17:14, 17; 1 Chr. 7:20).</a>

    <p>
      Territory of. At the time of the first census in the
      wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 (Num. 1:32, 33);
      forty years later, when about to take possession of the
      Promised Land, it numbered only 32,500. During the march
      (see CAMP &macr;T0000700) Ephraim&#39;s place was on the
      west side of the tabernacle (Num. 2:18-24). When the spies
      were sent out to spy the land, &quot;Oshea the son of
      Nun&quot; of this tribe signalized himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boundaries of the portion of the land assigned to
      Ephraim are given in Josh. 16:1-10. It included most of
      what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished from
      Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all
      traffic, from north to south, and from Jordan to the sea,
      and was about 55 miles long and 30 broad. The tabernacle
      and the ark were deposited within its limits at Shiloh,
      where it remained for four hundred years. During the time
      of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this
      tribe manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented
      spirit. &quot;For more than five hundred years, a period
      equal to that which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and
      the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two dependent
      tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed
      pre-eminence. Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the
      greatest of the judges, and Saul the first king, belonged
      to one or other of the three tribes. It was not till the
      close of the first period of Jewish history that God
      &#39;refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
      tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount
      Zion which he loved&#39; (Ps. 78:67, 68). When the ark was
      removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was
      humbled.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the causes which operated to bring about the
      disruption of Israel was Ephraim&#39;s jealousy of the
      growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till
      the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place
      of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and
      fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem
      within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the
      capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship
      for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in
      influence. The discontent came to a crisis by
      Rehoboam&#39;s refusal to grant certain redresses that were
      demanded (1 Kings 12).

      It is an interesting and instructive fact that a large
      portion of the New Testament is taken up with epistles. The
      doctrines of Christianity are thus not set forth in any
      formal treatise, but mainly in a collection of letters.
      &quot;Christianity was the first great missionary religion.
      It was the first to break the bonds of race and aim at
      embracing all mankind. But this necessarily involved a
      change in the mode in which it was presented. The prophet
      of the Old Testament, if he had anything to communicate,
      either appeared in person or sent messengers to speak for
      him by word of mouth. The narrow limits of Palestine made
      direct personal communication easy. But the case was
      different when the Christian Church came to consist of a
      number of scattered parts, stretching from Mesopotamia in
      the east to Rome or even Spain in the far west. It was only
      natural that the apostle by whom the greater number of
      these communities had been founded should seek to
      communicate with them by letter.&quot;

      such a city he was a public officer of great dignity, and
      his conversion to the gospel was accordingly a proof of the
      wonderful success of the apostle&#39;s labours.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A companion of Paul at Ephesus, who was sent by him
      along with Timothy into Macedonia (Acts 19:22). Corinth was
      his usual place of abode (2 Tim. 4:20); but probably he may

      10:10); the Orchoe of the Greeks and Romans. It was
      probably the city of the Archevites, who were transplanted
      to Samaria by Asnapper (Ezra 4:9). It lay on the left bank
      of the Euphrates, about 120 miles south-east of Babylon,
      and is now represented by the mounds and ruins of Warka. It
      appears to have been the necropolis of the Assyrian kings,
      as the whole region is strewed with bricks and the remains
      of coffins. &quot;Standing on the summit of the principal
      edifice, called the Buwarizza, a tower 200 feet square in
      the centre of the ruins, the beholder is struck with
      astonishment at the enormous accumulation of mounds and
      ancient relics at his feet. An irregular circle, nearly 6

      37:38). He ascended the throne about B.C. 681. Nothing
      further is recorded of him in Scripture, except that he
      settled certain colonists in Samaria (Ezra 4:2). But from
      the monuments it appears that he was the most powerful of
      all the Assyrian monarchs. He built many temples and
      palaces, the most magnificent of which was the south-west
      palace at Nimrud, which is said to have been in its general
      design almost the same as Solomon&#39;s palace, only much
      larger (1 Kings 7:1-12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In December B.C. 681 Sennacherib was murdered by two of his
      sons, who, after holding Nineveh for forty-two days, were
      compelled to fly to Erimenas of Ararat, or Armenia. Their
      brother Esarhaddon, who had been engaged in a campaign
      against Armenia, led his army against them. They were
      utterly overthrown in a battle fought April B.C. 680, near
      Malatiyeh, and in the following month Esarhaddon was
      crowned at Nineveh. He restored Babylon, conquered Egypt,
      and received tribute from Manasseh of Judah. He died in
      October B.C. 668, while on the march to suppress an
      Egyptian revolt, and was succeeded by his son
      Assur-bani-pal, whose younger brother was made viceroy of
      Babylonia.

      <a name="T0001243"><b>Esau -</b> hairy, Rebekah&#39;s
      first-born twin son (Gen. 25:25). The name of Edom,
      &quot;red&quot;, was also given to him from his conduct in
      connection with the red lentil &quot;pottage&quot; for
      which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances
      connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which
      afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the
      nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time
      Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while
      Esau, a &quot;son of the desert,&quot; devoted himself to
      the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain
      occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the
      cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his
      brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing
      (Gen. 27:28, 29, 36; Heb. 12:16, 17). He afterwards tried
      to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was
      defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother
      (Gen. 27:4, 34, 38).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his
      parents, he married (Gen. 26:34, 35) two Canaanitish
      maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the
      daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram,
      Esau tried to conciliate his parents (Gen. 28:8, 9) by
      marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This
      led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and
      driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that
      region. After some thirty years&#39; sojourn in Padan-aram
      Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who
      went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this,
      Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met,
      probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau
      now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a
      powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of
      Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the
      brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against
      Israel.

      separating the mountain ranges of Carmel and Samaria from
      those of Galilee, extending about 14 miles from north to
      south, and 9 miles from east to west. It is drained by
      &quot;that ancient river&quot; the Kishon, which flows
      westward to the Mediterranean. From the foot of Mount Tabor
      it branches out into three valleys, that on the north
      passing between Tabor and Little Hermon (Judg. 4:14); that
      on the south between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim (2 Kings
      9:27); while the central portion, the &quot;valley of
      Jezreel&quot; proper, runs into the Jordan valley (which is
      about 1,000 feet lower than Esdraelon) by Bethshean. Here
      Gideon gained his great victory over the Midianites (Judg.
      7:1-25). Here also Barak defeated Sisera, and Saul&#39;s
      army was defeated by the Philistines, and king Josiah,
      while fighting in disguise against Necho, king of Egypt,
      was slain (2 Chr. 35:20-27; 2 Kings 23-29). This plain has

      Crusaders, Frenchmen, Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks,

      <a name="T0001254"><b>Esther -</b> the queen of Ahasuerus,
      and heroine of the book that bears her name. She was a
      Jewess named Hadas&#39;sah (the myrtle), but when she
      entered the royal harem she received the name by which she
      henceforth became known (Esther 2:7). It is a Syro-Arabian
      modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a
      star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her
      family did not avail themselves of the permission granted
      by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she
      resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in
      the household of the Persian king at &quot;Shushan in the
      palace.&quot; Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose
      Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the
      Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill
      and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire.
      By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe
      was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had
      intended for Mordecai (Esther 7); and the Jews established
      an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of
      their wonderful deliverance. This took place about
      fifty-two years after the Return, the year of the great
      battles of Plataea and Mycale (B.C. 479).</a>

      Esther appears in the Bible as a &quot;woman of deep piety,
      faith, courage, patriotism, and caution, combined with
      resolution; a dutiful daughter to her adopted father,
      docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to share
      the king&#39;s favour with him for the good of the Jewish
      people. There must have been a singular grace and charm in
      her aspect and manners, since &#39;she obtained favour in
      the sight of all them that looked upon her&#39; (Esther
      2:15). That she was raised up as an instrument in the hand
      of God to avert the destruction of the Jewish people, and
      to afford them protection and forward their wealth and
      peace in their captivity, is also manifest from the
      Scripture account.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0001255"><b>Esther, Book of -</b> The authorship

      particular account also given of many historical details
      makes it probable that the writer was contemporary with
      Mordecai and Esther. Hence we may conclude that the book
      was written probably about B.C. 444-434, and that the
      author was one of the Jews of the dispersion.</a>

      6:2; 2 Thess. 1:9; Matt. 18:8; 25:41; Jude 1:7). The
      Scripture as clearly teaches the unending duration of the
      penal sufferings of the lost as the &quot;everlasting
      life,&quot; the &quot;eternal life&quot; of the righteous.
      The same Greek words in the New Testament (aion, aionios,
      aidios) are used to express (1) the eternal existence of
      God (1 Tim. 1:17; Rom. 1:20; 16:26); (2) of Christ (Rev.
      1:18); (3) of the Holy Ghost (Heb. 9:14); and (4) the
      eternal duration of the sufferings of the lost (Matt.
      25:46; Jude 1:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Their condition after casting off the mortal body is spoken
      of in these expressive words: &quot;Fire that shall not be
      quenched&quot; (Mark 9:45, 46), &quot;fire
      unquenchable&quot; (Luke 3:17), &quot;the worm that never
      dies,&quot; the &quot;bottomless pit&quot; (Rev. 9:1),
      &quot;the smoke of their torment ascending up for ever and
      ever&quot; (Rev. 14:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that the &quot;second death&quot; (Rev. 20:14) is
      in the case of the wicked their absolute destruction, their
      annihilation, has not the slightest support from Scripture,
      which always represents their future as one of conscious
      suffering enduring for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supposition that God will ultimately secure the
      repentance and restoration of all sinners is equally
      unscriptural. There is not the slightest trace in all the
      Scriptures of any such restoration. Sufferings of
      themselves have no tendency to purify the soul from sin or
      impart spiritual life. The atoning death of Christ and the
      sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit are the only means of
      divine appointment for bringing men to repentance. Now in
      the case of them that perish these means have been
      rejected, and &quot;there remaineth no more sacrifice for
      sins&quot; (Heb. 10:26, 27).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001258"><b>Eternal life -</b> This expression
      occurs in the Old Testament only in Dan. 12:2 (R.V.,
      &quot;everlasting life&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurs frequently in the New Testament (Matt. 7:14;
      18:8, 9; Luke 10:28; comp. 18:18). It comprises the whole
      future of the redeemed (Luke 16:9), and is opposed to
      &quot;eternal punishment&quot; (Matt. 19:29; 25:46). It is
      the final reward and glory into which the children of God
      enter (1 Tim. 6:12, 19; Rom. 6:22; Gal. 6:8; 1 Tim. 1:16;
      Rom. 5:21); their Sabbath of rest (Heb. 4:9; comp. 12:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      The newness of life which the believer derives from Christ
      (Rom. 6:4) is the very essence of salvation, and hence the
      life of glory or the eternal life must also be theirs (Rom.
      6:8; 2 Tim. 2:11, 12; Rom. 5:17, 21; 8:30; Eph. 2:5, 6). It
      is the &quot;gift of God in Jesus Christ our Lord&quot;
      (Rom. 6:23). The life the faithful have here on earth (John
      3:36; 5:24; 6:47, 53-58) is inseparably connected with the
      eternal life beyond, the endless life of the future, the
      happy future of the saints in heaven (Matt. 19:16, 29;
      25:46).

      of Egypt, which extended from the Mediterranean to the Gulf
      of Suez. Here the Israelites made their third encampment
      (Ex. 13:20; Num. 33:6). The camp was probably a little to
      the west of the modern town of Ismailia. Here the
      Israelites were commanded to change their route (Ex. 14:2),
      and &quot;turn&quot; towards the south, and encamp before

    <p>
      (2.) A Levite of the family of Merari, one of the leaders
      of the temple music (1 Chr. 6:44; 15:17, 19). He was
      probably the same as Jeduthun. He is supposed by some to be
      the same also as (1).

      i.e., of vintage offerings; called Tisri after the Exile;
      corresponding to part of September and October. It was the
      first month of the civil year, and the seventh of the
      sacred year (1 Kings 8:2).</a>

      <a name="T0001262"><b>Eth-baal -</b> with Baal, a king of
      Sidon (B.C. 940-908), father of Jezebel, who was the wife
      of Ahab (1 Kings 16:31). He is said to have been also a
      priest of Astarte, whose worship was closely allied to that
      of Baal, and this may account for his daughter&#39;s zeal
      in promoting idolatry in Israel. This marriage of Ahab was
      most fatal to both Israel and Judah. Dido, the founder of
      Carthage, was his granddaughter.</a>

      <a name="T0001263"><b>Ethiopia -</b> country of burnt
      faces; the Greek word by which the Hebrew Cush is rendered
      (Gen. 2:13; 2 Kings 19:9; Esther 1:1; Job 28:19; Ps. 68:31;
      87:4), a country which lay to the south of Egypt, beginning
      at Syene on the First Cataract (Ezek. 29:10; 30:6), and
      extending to beyond the confluence of the White and Blue
      Nile. It corresponds generally with what is now known as
      the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was
      known to the Hebrews, and is described in Isa. 18:1; Zeph.
      3:10. They carried on some commercial intercourse with it
      (Isa. 45:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Its inhabitants were descendants of Ham (Gen. 10:6; Jer.
      13:23; Isa. 18:2, &quot;scattered and peeled,&quot; A.V.;
      but in R.V., &quot;tall and smooth&quot;). Herodotus, the
      Greek historian, describes them as &quot;the tallest and
      handsomest of men.&quot; They are frequently represented on
      Egyptian monuments, and they are all of the type of the
      true negro. As might be expected, the history of this
      country is interwoven with that of Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethiopia is spoken of in prophecy (Ps. 68:31; 87:4; Isa.
      45:14; Ezek. 30:4-9; Dan. 11:43; Nah. 3:8-10; Hab. 3:7;

      <a name="T0001264"><b>Ethiopian eunuch -</b> the chief
      officer or prime minister of state of Candace (q.v.), queen
      of Ethiopia. He was converted to Christianity through the
      instrumentality of Philip (Act 8:27). The northern portion
      of Ethiopia formed the kingdom of Meroe, which for a long
      period was ruled over by queens, and it was probably from
      this kingdom that the eunuch came.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001265"><b>Ethiopian woman -</b> the wife of
      Moses (Num. 12:1). It is supposed that Zipporah, Moses&#39;
      first wife (Ex. 2:21), was now dead. His marriage of this
      &quot;woman&quot; descended from Ham gave offence to Aaron
      and Miriam.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001266"><b>Eunice -</b> happily conquering, the
      mother of Timothy, a believing Jewess, but married to a
      Greek (Acts 16:1). She trained her son from his childhood
      in the knowledge of the Scriptures (2 Tim. 3:15). She was
      distinguished by her &quot;unfeigned faith.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001267"><b>Eunuch -</b> literally bed-keeper or
      chamberlain, and not necessarily in all cases one who was
      mutilated, although the practice of employing such
      mutilated persons in Oriental courts was common (2 Kings
      9:32; Esther 2:3). The law of Moses excluded them from the
      congregation (Deut. 23:1). They were common also among the
      Greeks and Romans. It is said that even to-day there are
      some in Rome who are employed in singing soprano in the
      Sistine Chapel. Three classes of eunuchs are mentioned in
      Matt. 19:12.</a>

      <a name="T0001268"><b>Euodias -</b> a good journey, a
      female member of the church at Philippi. She was one who
      laboured much with Paul in the gospel. He exhorts her to be
      of one mind with Syntyche (Phil. 4:2). From this it seems
      they had been at variance with each other.</a>

      <a name="T0001269"><b>Euphrates -</b> Hebrew, Perath;
      Assyrian, Purat; Persian cuneiform, Ufratush, whence Greek
      Euphrates, meaning &quot;sweet water.&quot; The Assyrian
      name means &quot;the stream,&quot; or &quot;the great
      stream.&quot; It is generally called in the Bible simply
      &quot;the river&quot; (Ex. 23:31), or &quot;the great
      river&quot; (Deut. 1:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Euphrates is first mentioned in Gen. 2:14 as one of the
      rivers of Paradise. It is next mentioned in connection with
      the covenant which God entered into with Abraham (15:18),
      when he promised to his descendants the land from the river
      of Egypt to the river Euphrates (comp. Deut. 11:24; Josh.
      1:4), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the
      extended conquests of David (2 Sam. 8:2-14; 1 Chr. 18:3; 1
      Kings 4:24). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the
      north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon,
      and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made
      of the &quot;great river.&quot; Just as the Nile
      represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the
      Euphrates represented the Assyrian power (Isa. 8:7; Jer.
      2:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is by far the largest and most important of all the
      rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian
      mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties
      itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two
      sources, (1) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., &quot;the black
      river&quot;), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum;
      and (2) the Muradchai (i.e., &quot;the river of
      desire&quot;), which rises near Ararat, on the northern
      slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the
      source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they
      meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length
      joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called
      Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for
      above 140 miles to the sea. It is estimated that the
      alluvium brought down by these rivers encroaches on the sea
      at the rate of about one mile in thirty years.

      the name of the wind which blew in the Adriatic Gulf, and
      which struck the ship in which Paul was wrecked on the
      coast of Malta (Acts 27:14; R.V., &quot;Euraquilo,&quot;
      i.e., north-east wind). It is called a &quot;tempestuous
      wind,&quot; i.e., as literally rendered, a &quot;typhonic
      wind,&quot; or a typhoon. It is the modern Gregalia or
      Levanter. (Comp. Jonah 1:4.)</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001271"><b>Eutychus -</b> fortunate, (Acts
      20:9-12), a young man of Troas who fell through drowsiness
      from the open window of the third floor of the house where
      Paul was preaching, and was &quot;taken up dead.&quot; The
      lattice-work of the window being open to admit the air, the
      lad fell out and down to the court below. Paul restored him
      to life again. (Comp. 1 Kings 17:21; 2 Kings 4:34.)</a>

      <a name="T0001272"><b>Evangelist -</b> a &quot;publisher of
      glad tidings;&quot; a missionary preacher of the gospel
      (Eph. 4:11). This title is applied to Philip (Acts 21:8),
      who appears to have gone from city to city preaching the
      word (8:4, 40). Judging from the case of Philip,
      evangelists had neither the authority of an apostle, nor
      the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral
      supervision over a portion of the flock. They were
      itinerant preachers, having it as their special function to
      carry the gospel to places where it was previously unknown.
      The writers of the four Gospels are known as the
      Evangelists.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001273"><b>Eve -</b> life; living, the name
      given by Adam to his wife (Gen. 3:20; 4:1). The account of
      her creation is given in Gen. 2:21, 22. The Creator, by
      declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by
      creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to
      monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: &quot;This
      companion was taken from his side to signify that she was
      to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head,
      lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he
      should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote
      that species of equality which is to subsist in the
      marriage state.&quot; And again, &quot;That wife that is of
      God&#39;s making by special grace, and of God&#39;s
      bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a
      helpmeet to her husband.&quot; Through the subtle
      temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of
      God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also
      unto her husband (1 Tim. 2:13-15; 2 Cor. 11:3). When she
      gave birth to her first son, she said, &quot;I have gotten
      a man from the Lord&quot; (R.V., &quot;I have gotten a man
      with the help of the Lord,&quot; Gen. 4:1). Thus she
      welcomed Cain, as some think, as if he had been the
      Promised One the &quot;Seed of the woman.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0001274"><b>Evening -</b> the period following
      sunset with which the Jewish day began (Gen. 1:5; Mark
      13:35). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of each day, as
      appears from Ex. 16:12: 30:8; 12:6 (marg.); Lev. 23:5
      (marg. R.V., &quot;between the two evenings&quot;). The
      &quot;first evening&quot; was that period when the sun was
      verging towards setting, and the &quot;second evening&quot;
      the moment of actual sunset. The word &quot;evenings&quot;
      in Jer. 5:6 should be &quot;deserts&quot; (marg. R.V.).</a>

      by Daniel, he showed kindness to Jehoiachin, who had been a
      prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years. He released

      officers (2 Kings 24:12), and a large number of warriors
      (16), with very many persons of note (14), and artisans
      (16), leaving behind only those who were poor and helpless.
      This was the first general deportation to Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In B.C. 588, after the revolt of Zedekiah (q.v.), there was
      a second general deportation of Jews by Nebuchadnezzar
      (Jer. 52:29; 2 Kings 25:8), including 832 more of the
      principal men of the kingdom. He carried away also the rest
      of the sacred vessels (2 Chr. 36:18). From this period,
      when the temple was destroyed (2 Kings 25:9), to the
      complete restoration, B.C. 517 (Ezra 6:15), is the period
      of the &quot;seventy years.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In B.C. 582 occurred the last and final deportation. The
      entire number Nebuchadnezzar carried captive was 4,600
      heads of families with their wives and children and
      dependants (Jer. 52:30; 43:5-7; 2 Chr. 36:20, etc.). Thus
      the exiles formed a very considerable community in Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cyrus granted permission to the Jews to return to
      their own land (Ezra 1:5; 7:13), only a comparatively small
      number at first availed themselves of the privilege. It
      cannot be questioned that many belonging to the kingdom of
      Israel ultimately joined the Jews under Ezra, Zerubbabel,
      and Nehemiah, and returned along with them to Jerusalem
      (Jer. 50:4, 5, 17-20, 33-35).
    </p>
    <p>
      Large numbers had, however, settled in the land of Babylon,
      and formed numerous colonies in different parts of the
      kingdom. Their descendants very probably have spread far
      into Eastern lands and become absorbed in the general
      population. (See JUDAH, KINGDOM OF &macr;T0002126; <a href=

      wrought for the children of Isreal when they were brought
      out of the land of Egypt with &quot;a mighty hand and with
      an outstretched arm&quot; (Ex 12:51; Deut. 26:8; Ps 114;
      136), about B.C. 1490, and four hundred and eighty years (1
      Kings 6:1) before the building of Solomon&#39;s temple.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of their sojourning in Egypt was, according to Ex.
      12:40, the space of four hundred and thirty years. In the
      LXX., the words are, &quot;The sojourning of the children
      of Israel which they sojourned in Egypt and in the land of
      Canaan was four hundred and thirty years;&quot; and the
      Samaritan version reads, &quot;The sojourning of the
      children of Israel and of their fathers which they
      sojourned in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt
      was four hundred and thirty years.&quot; In Gen. 15:13-16,
      the period is prophetically given (in round numbers) as
      four hundred years. This passage is quoted by Stephen in
      his defence before the council (Acts 7:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The chronology of the &quot;sojourning&quot; is variously
      estimated. Those who adopt the longer term reckon thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      | Years | | From the descent of Jacob into Egypt to the |
      death of Joseph 71 | | From the death of Joseph to the
      birth of | Moses 278 | | From the birth of Moses to his
      flight into | Midian 40 | | From the flight of Moses to his
      return into | Egypt 40 | | From the return of Moses to the
      Exodus 1 | | 430
    </p>
    <p>
      Others contend for the shorter period of two hundred and
      fifteen years, holding that the period of four hundred and
      thirty years comprehends the years from the entrance of
      Abraham into Canaan (see LXX. and Samaritan) to the descent
      of Jacob into Egypt. They reckon thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      | Years | | From Abraham&#39;s arrival in Canaan to
      Isaac&#39;s | birth 25 | | From Isaac&#39;s birth to that

      birth to the going down into | Egypt 130 | | (215) | | From
      Jacob&#39;s going down into Egypt to the | death of Joseph
      71 | | From death of Joseph to the birth of Moses 64 | |

    </p>
    <p>
      During the forty years of Moses&#39; sojourn in the land of
      Midian, the Hebrews in Egypt were being gradually prepared
      for the great national crisis which was approaching. The
      plagues that successively fell upon the land loosened the
      bonds by which Pharaoh held them in slavery, and at length
      he was eager that they should depart. But the Hebrews must
      now also be ready to go. They were poor; for generations
      they had laboured for the Egyptians without wages. They
      asked gifts from their neighbours around them (Ex. 12:35),
      and these were readily bestowed. And then, as the first
      step towards their independent national organization, they
      observed the feast of the Passover, which was now
      instituted as a perpetual memorial. The blood of the
      paschal lamb was duly sprinkled on the door-posts and
      lintels of all their houses, and they were all within,
      waiting the next movement in the working out of God&#39;s
      plan. At length the last stroke fell on the land of Egypt.
      &quot;It came to pass, that at midnight Jehovah smote all
      the firstborn in the land of Egypt.&quot; Pharaoh rose up
      in the night, and called for Moses and Aaron by night, and
      said, &quot;Rise up, and get you forth from among my
      people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve
      Jehovah, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your
      herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me
      also.&quot; Thus was Pharaoh (q.v.) completely humbled and
      broken down. These words he spoke to Moses and Aaron
      &quot;seem to gleam through the tears of the humbled king,
      as he lamented his son snatched from him by so sudden a
      death, and tremble with a sense of the helplessness which
      his proud soul at last felt when the avenging hand of God
      had visited even his palace.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror-stricken Egyptians now urged the instant
      departure of the Hebrews. In the midst of the Passover
      feast, before the dawn of the 15th day of the month Abib
      (our April nearly), which was to be to them henceforth the
      beginning of the year, as it was the commencement of a new
      epoch in their history, every family, with all that
      appertained to it, was ready for the march, which instantly
      began under the leadership of the heads of tribes with
      their various sub-divisions. They moved onward, increasing
      as they went forward from all the districts of Goshen, over
      the whole of which they were scattered, to the common
      centre. Three or four days perhaps elapsed before the whole
      body of the people were assembled at Rameses, and ready to
      set out under their leader Moses (Ex. 12:37; Num. 33:3).
      This city was at that time the residence of the Egyptian
      court, and here the interviews between Moses and Pharaoh
      had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Rameses they journeyed to Succoth (Ex. 12:37),
      identified with Tel-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of
      Ismailia. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002900.html&amp;from=T0002968&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      PITHOM</a>.) Their third station was Etham (q.v.), 13:20,
      &quot;in the edge of the wilderness,&quot; and was probably
      a little to the west of the modern town of Ismailia, on the
      Suez Canal. Here they were commanded &quot;to turn and
      encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the
      sea&quot;, i.e., to change their route from east to due
      south. The Lord now assumed the direction of their march in
      the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. They were
      then led along the west shore of the Red Sea till they came
      to an extensive camping-ground &quot;before
      Pi-hahiroth,&quot; about 40 miles from Etham. This distance
      from Etham may have taken three days to traverse, for the
      number of camping-places by no means indicates the number
      of days spent on the journey: e.g., it took fully a month
      to travel from Rameses to the wilderness of Sin (Ex. 16:1),
      yet reference is made to only six camping-places during all
      that time. The exact spot of their encampment before they
      crossed the Red Sea cannot be determined. It was probably
      somewhere near the present site of Suez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the direction of God the children of Israel went
      &quot;forward&quot; from the camp &quot;before
      Pi-hahiroth,&quot; and the sea opened a pathway for them,
      so that they crossed to the farther shore in safety. The
      Egyptian host pursued after them, and, attempting to follow
      through the sea, were overwhelmed in its returning waters,
      and thus the whole military force of the Egyptians
      perished. They &quot;sank as lead in the mighty
      waters&quot; (Ex. 15:1-9; comp. Ps. 77:16-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the eastern shore of the sea, perhaps a
      little way to the north of &#39;Ayun Musa (&quot;the
      springs of Moses&quot;), there they encamped and rested
      probably for a day. Here Miriam and the other women sang
      the triumphal song recorded in Ex. 15:1-21.
    </p>
    <p>
      From &#39;Ayun Musa they went on for three days through a
      part of the barren &quot;wilderness of Shur&quot; (22),
      called also the &quot;wilderness of Etham&quot; (Num. 33:8;
      comp. Ex. 13:20), without finding water. On the last of
      these days they came to Marah (q.v.), where the
      &quot;bitter&quot; water was by a miracle made drinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their next camping-place was Elim (q.v.), where were twelve
      springs of water and a grove of &quot;threescore and
      ten&quot; palm trees (Ex. 15:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time the children of Israel &quot;took their
      journey from Elim,&quot; and encamped by the Red Sea (Num.
      33:10), and thence removed to the &quot;wilderness of
      Sin&quot; (to be distinguished from the wilderness of Zin,
      20:1), where they again encamped. Here, probably the modern
      el-Markha, the supply of bread they had brought with them
      out of Egypt failed. They began to &quot;murmur&quot; for
      want of bread. God &quot;heard their murmurings&quot; and
      gave them quails and manna, &quot;bread from heaven&quot;
      (Ex. 16:4-36). Moses directed that an omer of manna should
      be put aside and preserved as a perpetual memorial of
      God&#39;s goodness. They now turned inland, and after three
      encampments came to the rich and fertile valley of
      Rephidim, in the Wady Feiran. Here they found no water, and
      again murmured against Moses. Directed by God, Moses
      procured a miraculous supply of water from the &quot;rock
      in Horeb,&quot; one of the hills of the Sinai group
      (17:1-7); and shortly afterwards the children of Israel
      here fought their first battle with the Amalekites, whom
      they smote with the edge of the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the eastern extremity of the Wady Feiran the line of
      march now probably led through the Wady esh-Sheikh and the
      Wady Solaf, meeting in the Wady er-Rahah, &quot;the
      enclosed plain in front of the magnificient cliffs of Ras
      Sufsafeh.&quot; Here they encamped for more than a year
      (Num. 1:1; 10:11) before Sinai (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The different encampments of the children of Israel, from
      the time of their leaving Egypt till they reached the
      Promised Land, are mentioned in Ex. 12:37-19; Num. 10-21;
      33; Deut. 1, 2, 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of notice that there are unmistakable
      evidences that the Egyptians had a tradition of a great
      exodus from their country, which could be none other than
      the exodus of the Hebrews.

      <a name="T0001284"><b>Exodus, Book of -</b> Exodus is the
      name given in the LXX. to the second book of the Pentateuch
      (q.v.). It means &quot;departure&quot; or
      &quot;outgoing.&quot; This name was adopted in the Latin
      translation, and thence passed into other languages. The
      Hebrews called it by the first words, according to their
      custom, Ve-eleh shemoth (i.e., &quot;and these are the

      from Egypt to Sinai (12:37-19:2). (4.) The giving of the
      law and the establishment of the institutions by which the
      organization of the people was completed, the theocracy,

    <p>
      The time comprised in this book, from the death of Joseph
      to the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, is
      about one hundred and forty-five years, on the supposition
      that the four hundred and thirty years (12:40) are to be
      computed from the time of the promises made to Abraham
      (Gal. 3:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The authorship of this book, as well as of that of the
      other books of the Pentateuch, is to be ascribed to Moses.
      The unanimous voice of tradition and all internal evidences
      abundantly support this opinion.

      exorcist abounded. Many of these professional exorcists
      were disreputable Jews, like Simon in Samaria and Elymas in
      Cyprus (8:9; 13:6).&quot; Other references to exorcism as
      practised by the Jews are found in Matt. 12:27; Mark 9:38;
      Luke 9:49, 50. It would seem that it was an opinion among
      the Jews that miracles might be wrought by invoking the
      divine name. Thus also these &quot;vagabond Jews&quot;
      pretended that they could expel daemons.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of casting out devils was conferred by Christ on
      his apostles (Matt. 10:8), and on the seventy (Luke
      10:17-19), and was exercised by believers after his
      ascension (Mark 16:17; Acts 16:18); but this power was
      never spoken of as exorcism.

      stand in our room. It is that by which reconciliation is

      one is to view him with favour (Gen. 44:21; Job 24:23; Jer.

      The closing visions of this book are referred to in the
      book of Revelation (Ezek. 38=Rev. 20:8; Ezek. 47:1-8=Rev.
      22:1,2). Other references to this book are also found in
      the New Testament. (Comp. Rom. 2:24 with Ezek. 36:2; Rom.
      10:5, Gal. 3:12 with Ezek. 20:11; 2 Pet. 3:4 with Ezek.
      12:22.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be noted that Daniel, fourteen years after his
      deportation from Jerusalem, is mentioned by Ezekiel (14:14)
      along with Noah and Job as distinguished for his
      righteousness, and some five years later he is spoken of as
      pre-eminent for his wisdom (28:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel&#39;s prophecies are characterized by symbolical
      and allegorical representations, &quot;unfolding a rich
      series of majestic visions and of colossal symbols.&quot;
      There are a great many also of &quot;symbolcal actions
      embodying vivid conceptions on the part of the
      prophet&quot; (4:1-4; 5:1-4; 12:3-6; 24:3-5; 37:16, etc.)
      &quot;The mode of representation, in which symbols and
      allegories occupy a prominent place, gives a dark,
      mysterious character to the prophecies of Ezekiel. They are
      obscure and enigmatical. A cloudy mystery overhangs them
      which it is almost impossible to penetrate. Jerome calls
      the book &#39;a labyrith of the mysteries of God.&#39; It
      was because of this obscurity that the Jews forbade any one
      to read it till he had attained the age of thirty.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel is singular in the frequency with which he refers
      to the Pentateuch (e.g., Ezek. 27; 28:13; 31:8; 36:11, 34;
      47:13, etc.). He shows also an acquaintance with the
      writings of Hosea (Ezek. 37:22), Isaiah (Ezek. 8:12; 29:6),
      and especially with those of Jeremiah, his older
      contemporary (Jer. 24:7, 9; 48:37).

      Gulf of Akabah, near Elath or Eloth (Num. 33:35; Deut.
      2:8). Here Solomon built ships, &quot;Tarshish ships,&quot;
      like those trading from Tyre to Tarshish and the west,
      which traded with Ophir (1 Kings 9:26; 2 Chr. 8:17); and
      here also Jehoshaphat&#39;s fleet was shipwrecked (1 Kings
      22:48; 2 Chr. 20:36). It became a populous town, many of
      the Jews settling in it (2 Kings 16:6, &quot;Elath&quot;).
      It is supposed that anciently the north end of the gulf
      flowed further into the country than now, as far as
      &#39;Ain el-Ghudyan, which is 10 miles up the dry bed of
      the Arabah, and that Ezion-geber may have been there.</a>

      (2.) The &quot;scribe&quot; who led the second body of
      exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem B.C. 459,
      and author of the book of Scripture which bears his name.
      He was the son, or perhaps grandson, of Seraiah (2 Kings
      25:18-21), and a lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of
      Aaron (Ezra 7:1-5). All we know of his personal history is
      contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in
      Neh. 8 and 12:26.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus
      (see DARIUS &macr;T0000975), he obtained leave to go up to
      Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites
      (Ezra 8). Artaxerxes manifested great interest in
      Ezra&#39;s undertaking, granting him &quot;all his
      request,&quot; and loading him with gifts for the house of
      God. Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about
      5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to
      Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for
      three days, and were put into order for their march across
      the desert, which was completed in four months. His
      proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded
      in his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was &quot;a ready scribe in the law of Moses,&quot; who
      &quot;had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord
      and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and
      judgments.&quot; &quot;He is,&quot; says Professor Binnie,
      &quot;the first well-defined example of an order of men who
      have never since ceased in the church; men of sacred
      erudition, who devote their lives to the study of the Holy
      Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to
      interpret them for the instruction and edification of the
      church. It is significant that the earliest mention of the
      pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra&#39;s ministry (Neh.
      8:4). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn
      from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah
      that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in
      the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the
      constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with
      the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The
      final completion of the canon may have been, and probably
      was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have
      put it much into the shape in which it is still found in
      the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the complete
      organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it
      will be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical
      study&quot; (The Psalms: their History, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no
      record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in
      order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation.
      In that year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah,
      appears on the scene. After the ruined wall of the city had
      been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the
      people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the
      wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled,
      and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his
      assistants (Neh. 8:3). The remarkable scene is described in
      detail. There was a great religious awakening. For
      successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing
      their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept
      also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and
      joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant
      to be the Lord&#39;s. Abuses were rectified, and
      arrangements for the temple service completed, and now
      nothing remained but the dedication of the walls of the
      city (Neh. 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001295"><b>Ezra, Book of -</b> This book is the
      record of events occurring at the close of the Babylonian
      exile. It was at one time included in Nehemiah, the Jews
      regarding them as one volume. The two are still
      distinguished in the Vulgate version as I. and II. Esdras.
      It consists of two principal divisions:</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The history of the first return of exiles, in the
      first year of Cyrus (B.C. 536), till the completion and
      dedication of the new temple, in the sixth year of Darius
      Hystapes (B.C. 515), ch. 1-6. From the close of the sixth
      to the opening of the seventh chapter there is a blank in
      the history of about sixty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The history of the second return under Ezra, in the
      seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and of the events
      that took place at Jerusalem after Ezra&#39;s arrival there
      (7-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The book thus contains memorabilia connected with the Jews,
      from the decree of Cyrus (B.C. 536) to the reformation by
      Ezra (B.C. 456), extending over a period of about eighty
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no quotation from this book in the New Testament,
      but there never has been any doubt about its being
      canonical. Ezra was probably the author of this book, at
      least of the greater part of it (comp. 7:27, 28; 8:1,
      etc.), as he was also of the Books of Chronicles, the close
      of which forms the opening passage of Ezra.
    </p>

      <a name="T0001296"><b>Ezrahite -</b> a title given to Ethan
      (1 Kings 4:31; Ps. 89, title) and Heman (Ps. 88, title).
      They were both sons of Zerah (1 Chr. 2:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001297"><b>Ezri -</b> help of Jehovah, the son
      of Chelub. He superintended, under David, those who
      &quot;did the work of the field for tillage&quot; (1 Chr.
      27:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001298"><b>Fable -</b> applied in the New
      Testament to the traditions and speculations,
      &quot;cunningly devised fables&quot;, of the Jews on
      religious questions (1 Tim. 1:4; 4:7; 2 Tim. 4:4; Titus
      1:14; 2 Pet. 1:16). In such passages the word means
      anything false and unreal. But the word is used as almost
      equivalent to parable. Thus we have (1) the fable of
      Jotham, in which the trees are spoken of as choosing a king
      (Judg. 9:8-15); and (2) that of the cedars of Lebanon and
      the thistle as Jehoash&#39;s answer to Amaziah (2 Kings
      14:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001299"><b>Face -</b> means simply presence, as
      when it is recorded that Adam and Eve hid themselves from
      the &quot;face [R.V., &#39;presence&#39;] of the Lord
      God&quot; (Gen. 3:8; comp. Ex. 33:14, 15, where the same
      Hebrew word is rendered &quot;presence&quot;). The
      &quot;light of God&#39;s countenance&quot; is his favour
      (Ps. 44:3; Dan. 9:17). &quot;Face&quot; signifies also
      anger, justice, severity (Gen. 16:6, 8; Ex. 2:15; Ps. 68:1;
      Rev. 6:16). To &quot;provoke God to his face&quot; (Isa.
      65:3) is to sin against him openly.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews prayed with their faces toward the temple and
      Jerusalem (1 Kings 8:38, 44, 48; Dan. 6:10). To &quot;see
      God&#39;s face&quot; is to have access to him and to enjoy
      his favour (Ps. 17:15; 27:8). This is the privilege of holy
      angels (Matt. 18:10; Luke 1:19). The &quot;face of Jesus
      Christ&quot; (2 Cor. 4:6) is the office and person of
      Christ, the revealer of the glory of God (John 1:14, 18).
