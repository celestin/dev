      <a name="T0001300"><b>Fair Havens -</b> a harbour in the
      south of Crete, some 5 miles to the east of which was the
      town of Lasea (Acts 27:8). Here the ship of Alexandria in
      which Paul and his companions sailed was detained a
      considerable time waiting for a favourable wind. Contrary
      to Paul&#39;s advice, the master of the ship determined to
      prosecute the voyage, as the harbour was deemed
      incommodious for wintering in (9-12). The result was that,
      after a stormy voyage, the vessel was finally wrecked on
      the coast of Malta (27:40-44).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001301"><b>Fairs -</b> (Heb. &#39;izabhonim),
      found seven times in Ezek. 27, and nowhere else. The
      Authorized Version renders the word thus in all these
      instances, except in verse 33, where &quot;wares&quot; is
      used. The Revised Version uniformly renders by
      &quot;wares,&quot; which is the correct rendering of the
      Hebrew word. It never means &quot;fairs&quot; in the modern
      sense of the word.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001302"><b>Faith -</b> Faith is in general the
      persuasion of the mind that a certain statement is true
      (Phil. 1:27; 2 Thess. 2:13). Its primary idea is trust. A
      thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of
      many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance
      with the evidence on which it rests.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith is the result of teaching (Rom. 10:14-17). Knowledge
      is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes
      spoken of as an equivalent to faith (John 10:38; 1 John
      2:3). Yet the two are distinguished in this respect, that
      faith includes in it assent, which is an act of the will in
      addition to the act of the understanding. Assent to the
      truth is of the essence of faith, and the ultimate ground
      on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the
      veracity of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to
      certain statements which are regarded as mere facts of
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in
      men (e.g., Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by the
      influence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes
      styled the common operation of the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life
      inseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined
      than in the words of the Assembly&#39;s Shorter Catechism:
      &quot;Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we
      receive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is
      offered to us in the gospel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of saving faith is the whole revealed Word of
      God. Faith accepts and believes it as the very truth most
      sure. But the special act of faith which unites to Christ
      has as its object the person and the work of the Lord Jesus
      Christ (John 7:38; Acts 16:31). This is the specific act of
      faith by which a sinner is justified before God (Rom. 3:22,
      25; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9; John 3:16-36; Acts 10:43; 16:31).
      In this act of faith the believer appropriates and rests on
      Christ alone as Mediator in all his offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the
      divine testimony has always associated with it a deep sense
      of sin, a distinct view of Christ, a consenting will, and a
      loving heart, together with a reliance on, a trusting in,
      or resting in Christ. It is that state of mind in which a
      poor sinner, conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty
      self to Christ his Saviour, and rolls over the burden of
      all his sins on him. It consists chiefly, not in the assent
      given to the testimony of God in his Word, but in embracing
      with fiducial reliance and trust the one and only Saviour
      whom God reveals. This trust and reliance is of the essence
      of faith. By faith the believer directly and immediately
      appropriates Christ as his own. Faith in its direct act
      makes Christ ours. It is not a work which God graciously
      accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is only the hand
      by which we take hold of the person and work of our
      Redeemer as the only ground of our salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saving faith is a moral act, as it proceeds from a renewed
      will, and a renewed will is necessary to believing assent
      to the truth of God (1 Cor. 2:14; 2 Cor. 4:4). Faith,
      therefore, has its seat in the moral part of our nature
      fully as much as in the intellectual. The mind must first
      be enlightened by divine teaching (John 6:44; Acts 13:48; 2
      Cor. 4:6; Eph. 1:17, 18) before it can discern the things
      of the Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith is necessary to our salvation (Mark 16:16), not
      because there is any merit in it, but simply because it is
      the sinner&#39;s taking the place assigned him by God, his
      falling in with what God is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warrant or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not
      the reasonableness of what God says, but the simple fact
      that he says it. Faith rests immediately on, &quot;Thus
      saith the Lord.&quot; But in order to this faith the
      veracity, sincerity, and truth of God must be owned and
      appreciated, together with his unchangeableness. God&#39;s
      word encourages and emboldens the sinner personally to
      transact with Christ as God&#39;s gift, to close with him,
      embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ as
      his. That word comes with power, for it is the word of God
      who has revealed himself in his works, and especially in
      the cross. God is to be believed for his word&#39;s sake,
      but also for his name&#39;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith in Christ secures for the believer freedom from
      condemnation, or justification before God; a participation
      in the life that is in Christ, the divine life (John 14:19;
      Rom. 6:4-10; Eph. 4:15,16, etc.); &quot;peace with
      God&quot; (Rom. 5:1); and sanctification (Acts 26:18; Gal.
      5:6; Acts 15:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      All who thus believe in Christ will certainly be saved
      (John 6:37, 40; 10:27, 28; Rom. 8:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The faith=the gospel (Acts 6:7; Rom. 1:5; Gal. 1:23; 1 Tim.
      3:9; Jude 1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001303"><b>Faithful -</b> as a designation of
      Christians, means full of faith, trustful, and not simply
      trustworthy (Acts 10:45; 16:1; 2 Cor. 6:15; Col. 1:2; 1
      Tim. 4:3, 12; 5:16; 6:2; Titus 1:6; Eph. 1:1; 1 Cor. 4:17,
      etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is used also of God&#39;s word or covenant as true and
      to be trusted (Ps. 119:86, 138; Isa. 25:1; 1 Tim. 1:15;
      Rev. 21:5; 22:6, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001304"><b>Fall of man -</b> an expression
      probably borrowed from the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom, to
      express the fact of the revolt of our first parents from
      God, and the consequent sin and misery in which they and
      all their posterity were involved.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Fall is recorded in Gen. 2 and 3. That
      history is to be literally interpreted. It records facts
      which underlie the whole system of revealed truth. It is
      referred to by our Lord and his apostles not only as being
      true, but as furnishing the ground of all God&#39;s
      subsequent dispensations and dealings with the children of
      men. The record of Adam&#39;s temptation and fall must be
      taken as a true historical account, if we are to understand
      the Bible at all as a revelation of God&#39;s purpose of
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of this first sin upon our first parents
      themselves were (1) &quot;shame, a sense of degradation and
      pollution; (2) dread of the displeasure of God, or a sense
      of guilt, and the consequent desire to hide from his
      presence. These effects were unavoidable. They prove the
      loss not only of innocence but of original righteousness,
      and, with it, of the favour and fellowship of God. The
      state therefore to which Adam was reduced by his
      disobedience, so far as his subjective condition is
      concerned, was analogous to that of the fallen angels. He
      was entirely and absolutely ruined&quot; (Hodge&#39;s
      Theology).
    </p>
    <p>
      But the unbelief and disobedience of our first parents
      brought not only on themselves this misery and ruin, it
      entailed also the same sad consequences on all their
      descendants. (1.) The guilt, i.e., liability to punishment,
      of that sin comes by imputation upon all men, because all
      were represented by Adam in the covenant of works (q.v.).
      (See <a href=
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001800.html&amp;from=T0001878&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      IMPUTATION</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Hence, also, all his descendants inherit a corrupt
      nature. In all by nature there is an inherent and
      prevailing tendency to sin. This universal depravity is
      taught by universal experience. All men sin as soon as they
      are capable of moral actions. The testimony of the
      Scriptures to the same effect is most abundant (Rom. 1; 2;
      3:1-19, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) This innate depravity is total: we are by nature
      &quot;dead in trespasses and sins,&quot; and must be
      &quot;born again&quot; before we can enter into the kingdom
      (John 3:7, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Resulting from this &quot;corruption of our whole
      nature&quot; is our absolute moral inability to change our
      nature or to obey the law of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commenting on John 9:3, Ryle well remarks: &quot;A deep and
      instructive principle lies in these words. They surely
      throw some light on that great question, the origin of
      evil. God has thought fit to allow evil to exist in order
      that he may have a platform for showing his mercy, grace,
      and compassion. If man had never fallen there would have
      been no opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by
      permitting evil, mysterious as it seems, God&#39;s works of
      grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners have been
      wonderfully manifested to all his creatures. The redeeming
      of the church of elect sinners is the means of &#39;showing
      to principalities and powers the manifold wisdom of
      God&#39; (Eph. 3:10). Without the Fall we should have known
      nothing of the Cross and the Gospel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the monuments of Egypt are found representations of a
      deity in human form, piercing with a spear the head of a
      serpent. This is regarded as an illustration of the wide
      dissemination of the tradition of the Fall. The story of
      the &quot;golden age,&quot; which gives place to the
      &quot;iron age&quot;, the age of purity and innocence,
      which is followed by a time when man becomes a prey to sin
      and misery, as represented in the mythology of Greece and
      Rome, has also been regarded as a tradition of the Fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001305"><b>Fallow-deer -</b> Deut. 14:5 (R.V.,
      &quot;Wild goat&quot;); 1 Kings 4:23 (R.V.,
      &quot;roebucks&quot;). This animal, called in Hebrew <i>
      yahmur</i>, from a word meaning &quot;to be red,&quot; is
      regarded by some as the common fallow-deer, the Cervus
      dama, which is said to be found very generally over Western
      and Southern Asia. It is called &quot;fallow&quot; from its
      pale-red or yellow colour. Some interpreters, however,
      regard the name as designating the bubale, Antelope bubale,
      the &quot;wild cow&quot; of North Africa, which is about
      the size of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A
      species of deer has been found at Mount Carmel which is
      called <i>yahmur</i> by the Arabs. It is said to be similar
      to the European roebuck.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001306"><b>Fallow-ground -</b> The expression,
      &quot;Break up your fallow ground&quot; (Hos. 10:12; Jer.
      4:3) means, &quot;Do not sow your seed among thorns&quot;,
      i.e., break off all your evil habits; clear your hearts of
      weeds, in order that they may be prepared for the seed of
      righteousness. Land was allowed to lie fallow that it might
      become more fruitful; but when in this condition, it soon
      became overgrown with thorns and weeds. The cultivator of
      the soil was careful to &quot;break up&quot; his fallow
      ground, i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowing
      seed in it. So says the prophet, &quot;Break off your evil
      ways, repent of your sins, cease to do evil, and then the
      good seed of the word will have room to grow and bear
      fruit.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001307"><b>Familiar spirit -</b> Sorcerers or
      necormancers, who professed to call up the dead to answer
      questions, were said to have a &quot;familiar spirit&quot;
      (Deut. 18:11; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6; Lev. 19:31; 20:6;
      Isa. 8:19; 29:4). Such a person was called by the Hebrews
      an <i>&#39;ob</i>, which properly means a leathern bottle;
      for sorcerers were regarded as vessels containing the
      inspiring demon. This Hebrew word was equivalent to the
      pytho of the Greeks, and was used to denote both the person
      and the spirit which possessed him (Lev. 20:27; 1 Sam.
      28:8; comp. Acts 16:16). The word &quot;familiar&quot; is
      from the Latin familiaris, meaning a &quot;household
      servant,&quot; and was intended to express the idea that
      sorcerers had spirits as their servants ready to obey their
      commands.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001308"><b>Famine -</b> The first mentioned in
      Scripture was so grievous as to compel Abraham to go down
      to the land of Egypt (Gen. 26:1). Another is mentioned as
      having occurred in the days of Isaac, causing him to go to
      Gerar (Gen. 26:1, 17). But the most remarkable of all was
      that which arose in Egypt in the days of Joseph, which
      lasted for seven years (Gen. 41-45).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Famines were sent as an effect of God&#39;s anger against a
      guilty people (2 Kings 8:1, 2; Amos 8:11; Deut. 28:22-42; 2
      Sam. 21:1; 2 Kings 6:25-28; 25:3; Jer. 14:15; 19:9; 42:17,
      etc.). A famine was predicted by Agabus (Acts 11:28).
      Josephus makes mention of the famine which occurred A.D.
      45. Helena, queen of Adiabene, being at Jerusalem at that
      time, procured corn from Alexandria and figs from Cyprus
      for its poor inhabitants.

      grain was thrown up against the wind that it might be
      cleansed from broken straw and chaff (Isa. 30:24; Jer.
      15:7; Matt. 3:12). (See <a href=

      had a certain portion of land assigned to him as a
      possession (Num. 26:33-56). In Egypt the lands all belonged
      to the king, and the husbandmen were obliged to give him a
      fifth part of the produce; so in Palestine Jehovah was the
      sole possessor of the soil, and the people held it by
      direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the
      Hebrews paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was
      assigned to the priesthood. Military service when required
      was also to be rendered by every Hebrew at his own expense.
      The occuptaion of a husbandman was held in high honour (1
      Sam. 11:5-7; 1 Kings 19:19; 2 Chr. 26:10). (See LAND LAWS

      The only other mention of a periodical fast in the Old

      (comp. Num. 14:27), to commemorate the burning of the city
      and temple (Jer. 52:12, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The fast of the seventh month, kept on the third of
      Tisri (comp. 2 Kings 25), the anniversary of the murder of
      Gedaliah (Jer. 41:1, 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The fast of the tenth month (comp. Jer. 52:4; Ezek.
      33:21; 2 Kings 25:1), to commemorate the beginning of the
      siege of the holy city by Nebuchadnezzar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in addition to these the fast appointed by Esther
      (4:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Public national fasts on account of sin or to supplicate
      divine favour were sometimes held. (1.) 1 Sam. 7:6; (2.) 2
      Chr. 20:3; (3.) Jer. 36:6-10; (4.) Neh. 9:1.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also local fasts. (1.) Judg. 20:26; (2.) 2 Sam.
      1:12; (3.) 1 Sam. 31:13; (4.) 1 Kings 21:9-12; (5.) Ezra
      8:21-23: (6.) Jonah 3:5-9.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many instances of private occasional fasting (1
      Sam. 1:7: 20:34; 2 Sam. 3:35; 12:16; 1 Kings 21:27; Ezra
      10:6; Neh. 1:4; Dan. 10:2,3). Moses fasted forty days (Ex.
      24:18; 34:28), and so also did Elijah (1 Kings 19:8). Our
      Lord fasted forty days in the wilderness (Matt. 4:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lapse of time the practice of fasting was lamentably
      abused (Isa. 58:4; Jer. 14:12; Zech. 7:5). Our Lord rebuked
      the Pharisees for their hypocritical pretences in fasting
      (Matt. 6:16). He himself appointed no fast. The early
      Christians, however, observed the ordinary fasts according
      to the law of their fathers (Acts 13:3; 14:23; 2 Cor. 6:5).

      <a name="T0001313"><b>Fat -</b> (Heb. heleb) denotes the
      richest part of the animal, or the fattest of the flock, in
      the account of Abel&#39;s sacrifice (Gen. 4:4). It
      sometimes denotes the best of any production (Gen. 45:18;
      Num. 18:12; Ps. 81:16; 147:47). The fat of sacrifices was
      to be burned (Lev. 3:9-11; 4:8; 7:3; 8:25; Num. 18:17.
      Comp. Ex. 29:13-22; Lev. 3:3-5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is used figuratively for a dull, stupid state of mind
      (Ps 17:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Joel 2:24 the word is equivalent to &quot;vat,&quot; a
      vessel. The hebrew word here thus rendered is elsewhere
      rendered &quot;wine-fat&quot; and &quot;press-fat&quot;
      (Hag. 2:16; Isa. 63:2).

      <a name="T0001314"><b>Father -</b> a name applied (1) to
      any ancestor (Deut. 1:11; 1 Kings 15:11; Matt. 3:9; 23:30,
      etc.); and (2) as a title of respect to a chief, ruler, or
      elder, etc. (Judg. 17:10; 18:19; 1 Sam. 10:12; 2 Kings
      2:12; Matt. 23:9, etc.). (3) The author or beginner of
      anything is also so called; e.g., Jabal and Jubal (Gen.
      4:20, 21; comp. Job 38:28).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Applied to God (Ex. 4:22; Deut. 32:6; 2 Sam. 7:14; Ps.
      89:27, 28, etc.). (1.) As denoting his covenant relation to
      the Jews (Jer. 31:9; Isa. 63:16; 64:8; John 8:41, etc.).

      (2.) Believers are called God&#39;s &quot;sons&quot; (John
      1:12; Rom. 8:16; Matt. 6:4, 8, 15, 18; 10:20, 29). They
      also call him &quot;Father&quot; (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2
      Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:4)

      both arms fully stretched out.</a>

      for slaughter (2 Sam. 6:13; Isa. 11:6; Ezek. 39:18. Comp.
      Matt. 22:4, where the word used in the original, sitistos,
      means literally &quot;corn-fed;&quot; i.e., installed,
      fat). (2.) Ps. 66:15 (Heb. meah, meaning
      &quot;marrowy,&quot; &quot;fat,&quot; a species of sheep).
      (3.) 1 Sam. 15:9 (Heb. mishneh, meaning &quot;the
      second,&quot; and hence probably &quot;cattle of a second

      lambs, and therfore of less value).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001317"><b>Fear of the Lord the -</b> is in the
      Old Testament used as a designation of true piety (Prov.
      1:7; Job 28:28; Ps. 19:9). It is a fear conjoined with love
      and hope, and is therefore not a slavish dread, but rather
      filial reverence. (Comp. Deut. 32:6; Hos. 11:1; Isa. 1:2;
      63:16; 64:8.) God is called &quot;the Fear of Isaac&quot;
      (Gen. 31:42, 53), i.e., the God whom Isaac feared.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A holy fear is enjoined also in the New Testament as a
      preventive of carelessness in religion, and as an incentive
      to penitence (Matt. 10:28; 2 Cor. 5:11; 7:1; Phil. 2:12;
      Eph. 5:21; Heb. 12:28, 29).

      (Gen. 19:3; 2 Sam. 3:20; 2 Kings 6:23); on occasions of
      domestic joy (Luke 15:23; Gen. 21:8); on birthdays (Gen.
      40:20; Job 1:4; Matt. 14:6); and on the occasion of a
      marriage (Judg. 14:10; Gen. 29:22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Feasting was a part of the observances connected with the
      offering up of sacrifices (Deut. 12:6, 7; 1 Sam. 9:19;
      16:3, 5), and with the annual festivals (Deut. 16:11).
      &quot;It was one of the designs of the greater solemnities,
      which required the attendance of the people at the sacred
      tent, that the oneness of the nation might be maintained
      and cemented together, by statedly congregating in one
      place, and with one soul taking part in the same religious
      services. But that oneness was primarily and chiefly a
      religious and not merely a political one; the people were
      not merely to meet as among themselves, but with Jehovah,
      and to present themselves before him as one body; the
      meeting was in its own nature a binding of themselves in
      fellowship with Jehovah; so that it was not politics and
      commerce that had here to do, but the soul of the Mosaic
      dispensation, the foundation of the religious and political
      existence of Israel, the covenant with Jehovah. To keep the
      people&#39;s consciousness alive to this, to revive,
      strengthen, and perpetuate it, nothing could be so well
      adapated as these annual feasts.&quot; (See <a href=

      FESTIVALS</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001319"><b>Felix -</b> happy, the Roman
      procurator of Judea before whom Paul &quot;reasoned&quot;
      (Acts 24:25). He appears to have expected a bribe from
      Paul, and therefore had several interviews with him. The
      &quot;worthy deeds&quot; referred to in 24:2 was his
      clearing the country of banditti and impostors.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a two years&#39; term, Porcius Festus was
      appointed in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to
      Rome, and was there accused of cruelty and malversation of
      office by the Jews of Caesarea. The accusation was rendered
      nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero.
      (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8, 9.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, having been
      induced by Felix to desert her husband, the king of Emesa,
      became his adulterous companion. She was seated beside him
      when Paul &quot;reasoned&quot; before the judge. When Felix
      gave place to Festus, being &quot;willing to do the Jews a
      pleasure,&quot; he left Paul bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001320"><b>Fellowship -</b> (1.) With God,
      consisting in the knowledge of his will (Job 22:21; John
      17:3); agreement with his designs (Amos 3:2); mutual
      affection (Rom. 8: 38, 39); enjoyment of his presence (Ps.
      4:6); conformity to his image (1 John 2:6; 1:6); and
      participation of his felicity (1 John 1:3, 4; Eph.
      3:14-21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Of saints with one another, in duties (Rom. 12:5; 1
      Cor. 12:1; 1 Thess. 5:17, 18); in ordinances (Heb. 10:25;
      Acts 2:46); in grace, love, joy, etc. (Mal. 3:16; 2 Cor.
      8:4); mutual interest, spiritual and temporal (Rom. 12:4,
      13; Heb. 13:16); in sufferings (Rom. 15:1, 2; Gal. 6:1, 2;
      Rom. 12:15; and in glory (Rev. 7:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001321"><b>Fence -</b> (Heb. gader), Num. 22:24
      (R.V.). Fences were constructions of unmortared stones, to
      protect gardens, vineyards, sheepfolds, etc. From various
      causes they were apt to bulge out and fall (Ps. 62:3). In
      Ps. 80:12, R.V. (see Isa. 5:5), the psalmist says,
      &quot;Why hast thou broken down her fences?&quot; Serpents
      delight to lurk in the crevices of such fences (Eccl. 10:8;
      comp. Amos 5:19).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001322"><b>Fenced cities -</b> There were in
      Palestine (1) cities, (2) unwalled villages, and (3)
      villages with castles or towers (1 Chr. 27:25). Cities, so
      called, had walls, and were thus fenced. The fortifications
      consisted of one or two walls, on which were towers or
      parapets at regular intervals (2 Chr. 32:5; Jer. 31:38).
      Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which
      were ninety towers, on the second fourteen, and on the
      third sixty. The tower of Hananeel, near the north-east
      corner of the city wall, is frequently referred to (Neh.
      3:1; 12:39; Zech. 14:10). The gateways of such cities were
      also fortified (Neh. 2:8; 3:3, 6; Judg. 16:2, 3; 1 Sam.
      23:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrews found many fenced cities when they entered the
      Promised Land (Num. 13:28; 32:17, 34-42; Josh. 11:12, 13;
      Judg. 1:27-33), and we may estimate the strength of some of
      these cities from the fact that they were long held in
      possession by the Canaanites. The Jebusites, e.g., were
      enabled to hold possession of Jerusalem till the time of
      David (2 Sam. 5:6, 7; 1 Chr. 11:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the kings of Israel and Judah distinguished
      themselves as fortifiers or &quot;builders&quot; of cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001323"><b>Ferret -</b> Lev. 11:30 (R.V.,
      &quot;gecko&quot;), one of the unclean creeping things. It
      was perhaps the Lacerta gecko which was intended by the
      Hebrew word (anakah, a cry, &quot;mourning,&quot; the
      creature which groans) here used, i.e., the
      &quot;fan-footed&quot; lizard, the gecko which makes a
      mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by a word meaning
      &quot;shrew-mouse,&quot; of which there are three species
      in Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the
      hedgehog. The translation of the Revised Version is to be
      preferred.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001324"><b>Ferry boat -</b> (2 Sam. 19:18), some
      kind of boat for crossing the river which the men of Judah
      placed at the service of the king. Floats or rafts for this
      purpose were in use from remote times (Isa. 18:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001325"><b>Festivals, Religious -</b> There were
      daily (Lev. 23), weekly, monthly, and yearly festivals, and
      great stress was laid on the regular observance of them in
      every particular (Num. 28:1-8; Ex. 29:38-42; Lev. 6:8-23;
      Ex. 30:7-9; 27:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The septenary festivals were,
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The weekly Sabbath (Lev. 23:1-3; Ex. 19:3-30; 20:8-11;
      31:12, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The seventh new moon, or the feast of Trumpets (Num.
      28:11-15; 29:1-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) The Sabbatical year (Ex. 23:10, 11; Lev. 25:2-7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The year of jubilee (Lev. 23-35; 25: 8-16; 27:16-25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The great feasts were,
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The Passover. (b) The feast of Pentecost, or of weeks.
      (c) The feast of Tabernacles, or of ingathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each of these occasions every male Israelite was
      commanded &quot;to appear before the Lord&quot; (Deut.
      27:7; Neh. 8:9-12). The attendance of women was voluntary.
      (Comp. Luke 2:41; 1 Sam. 1:7; 2:19.) The promise that God
      would protect their homes (Ex. 34:23, 24) while all the
      males were absent in Jerusalem at these feasts was always
      fulfilled. &quot;During the whole period between Moses and
      Christ we never read of an enemy invading the land at the
      time of the three festivals. The first instance on record
      is thirty-three years after they had withdrawn from
      themselves the divine protection by imbruing their hands in
      the Saviour&#39;s blood, when Cestius, the Roman general,
      slew fifty of the people of Lydda while all the rest had
      gone up to the feast of Tabernacles, A.D. 66.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      These festivals, besides their religious purpose, had an
      important bearing on the maintenance among the people of
      the feeling of a national unity. The times fixed for their
      observance were arranged so as to interfere as little as
      possible with the industry of the people. The Passover was
      kept just before the harvest commenced, Pentecost at the
      conclusion of the corn harvest and before the vintage, the
      feast of Tabernacles after all the fruits of the ground had
      been gathered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh
      month (Lev. 16:1, 34; 23:26-32; Num. 29:7-11). (See

    <p>
      Of the post-Exilian festivals reference is made to the
      feast of Dedication (John 10:22). This feast was appointed
      by Judas Maccabaeus in commemoration of the purification of
      the temple after it had been polluted by Antiochus
      Epiphanes. The &quot;feast of Purim&quot; (q.v.), Esther
      9:24-32, was also instituted after the Exile. (Cf. John
      5:1.)

    <p>
      <a name="T0001326"><b>Festus, Porcius -</b> the successor
      of Felix (A.D. 60) as procurator of Judea (Acts 24:27). A
      few weeks after he had entered on his office the case of
      Paul, then a prisoner at Caesarea, was reported to him. The
      &quot;next day,&quot; after he had gone down to Caesarea,
      he heard Paul defend himself in the presence of Herod
      Agrippa II. and his sister Bernice, and not finding in him
      anything worthy of death or of bonds, would have set him
      free had he not appealed unto Caesar (Acts 25:11, 12). In
      consequence of this appeal Paul was sent to Rome. Festus,
      after being in office less than two years, died in Judea.

      <a name="T0001327"><b>Fever -</b> (Deut. 28:22; Matt. 8:14;
      Mark 1:30; John 4:52; Acts 28:8), a burning heat, as the
      word so rendered denotes, which attends all febrile
      attacks. In all Eastern countries such diseases are very
      common. Peter&#39;s wife&#39;s mother is said to have
      suffered from a &quot;great fever&quot; (Luke 4:38), an
      instance of Luke&#39;s professional exactitude in
      describing disease. He adopts here the technical medical
      distinction, as in those times fevers were divided into the
      &quot;great&quot; and the &quot;less.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001328"><b>Field -</b> (Heb. sadeh), a
      cultivated field, but unenclosed. It is applied to any
      cultivated ground or pasture (Gen. 29:2; 31:4; 34:7), or
      tillage (Gen. 37:7; 47:24). It is also applied to woodland
      (Ps. 132:6) or mountain top (Judg. 9:32, 36; 2 Sam. 1:21).
      It denotes sometimes a cultivated region as opposed to the
      wilderness (Gen. 33:19; 36:35). Unwalled villages or
      scattered houses are spoken of as &quot;in the fields&quot;
      (Deut. 28:3, 16; Lev. 25:31; Mark 6:36, 56). The &quot;open
      field&quot; is a place remote from a house (Gen. 4:8; Lev.
      14:7, 53; 17:5). Cultivated land of any extent was called a
      field (Gen. 23:13, 17; 41:8; Lev. 27:16; Ruth 4:5; Neh.
      12:29).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001329"><b>Fig -</b> First mentioned in Gen.
      3:7. The fig-tree is mentioned (Deut. 8:8) as one of the
      valuable products of Palestine. It was a sign of peace and
      prosperity (1 Kings 4:25; Micah 4:4; Zech. 3:10). Figs were
      used medicinally (2 Kings 20:7), and pressed together and
      formed into &quot;cakes&quot; as articles of diet (1 Sam.
      30:12; Jer. 24:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord&#39;s cursing the fig-tree near Bethany (Mark
      11:13) has occasioned much perplexity from the
      circumstance, as mentioned by the evangelist, that
      &quot;the time of figs was not yet.&quot; The explanation
      of the words, however, lies in the simple fact that the
      fruit of the fig-tree appears before the leaves, and hence
      that if the tree produced leaves it ought also to have had
      fruit. It ought to have had fruit if it had been true to
      its &quot;pretensions,&quot; in showing its leaves at this
      particular season. &quot;This tree, so to speak, vaunted
      itself to be in advance of all the other trees, challenged
      the passer-by that he should come and refresh himself with
      its fruit. Yet when the Lord accepted its challenge and
      drew near, it proved to be but as the others, without fruit
      as they; for indeed, as the evangelist observes, the time
      of figs had not yet arrived. Its fault, if one may use the
      word, lay in its pretensions, in its making a show to run
      before the rest when it did not so indeed&quot; (Trench,
      Miracles).

    <p>
      The fig-tree of Palestine (Ficus carica) produces two and
      sometimes three crops of figs in a year, (1) the bikkurah,
      or &quot;early-ripe fig&quot; (Micah 7:1; Isa. 28:4; Hos.
      9:10, R.V.), which is ripe about the end of June, dropping
      off as soon as it is ripe (Nah. 3:12); (2) the kermus, or
      &quot;summer fig,&quot; then begins to be formed, and is
      ripe about August; and (3) the pag (plural &quot;green
      figs,&quot; Cant. 2:13; Gr. olynthos, Rev. 6:13, &quot;the
      untimely fig&quot;), or &quot;winter fig,&quot; which
      ripens in sheltered spots in spring.

      <a name="T0001334"><b>Fire -</b> (1.) For sacred purposes.
      The sacrifices were consumed by fire (Gen. 8:20). The
      ever-burning fire on the altar was first kindled from
      heaven (Lev. 6:9, 13; 9:24), and afterwards rekindled at
      the dedication of Solomon&#39;s temple (2 Chr. 7:1, 3). The
      expressions &quot;fire from heaven&quot; and &quot;fire of
      the Lord&quot; generally denote lightning, but sometimes
      also the fire of the altar was so called (Ex. 29:18; Lev.
      1:9; 2:3; 3:5, 9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire for a sacred purpose obtained otherwise than from the
      altar was called &quot;strange fire&quot; (Lev. 10:1, 2;
      Num. 3:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The victims slain for sin offerings were afterwards
      consumed by fire outside the camp (Lev. 4:12, 21; 6:30;
      16:27; Heb. 13:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) For domestic purposes, such as baking, cooking,
      warmth, etc. (Jer. 36:22; Mark 14:54; John 18:18). But on
      Sabbath no fire for any domestic purpose was to be kindled
      (Ex. 35:3; Num. 15:32-36).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Punishment of death by fire was inflicted on such as
      were guilty of certain forms of unchastity and incest (Lev.
      20:14; 21:9). The burning of captives in war was not
      unknown among the Jews (2 Sam. 12:31; Jer. 29:22). The
      bodies of infamous persons who were executed were also
      sometimes burned (Josh. 7:25; 2 Kings 23:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) In war, fire was used in the destruction of cities, as
      Jericho (Josh. 6:24), Ai (8:19), Hazor (11:11), Laish
      (Judg. 18:27), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites were
      burnt (Josh. 11:6, 9, 13). The Israelites burned the images
      (2 Kings 10:26; R.V., &quot;pillars&quot;) of the house of
      Baal. These objects of worship seem to have been of the
      nature of obelisks, and were sometimes evidently made of
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle
      (Judg. 7:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Figuratively, fire is a symbol of Jehovah&#39;s
      presence and the instrument of his power (Ex. 14:19; Num.
      11:1, 3; Judg. 13:20; 1 Kings 18:38; 2 Kings 1:10, 12;
      2:11; Isa. 6:4; Ezek. 1:4; Rev. 1:14, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      God&#39;s word is also likened unto fire (Jer. 23:29). It
      is referred to as an emblem of severe trials or misfortunes
      (Zech. 12:6; Luke 12:49; 1 Cor. 3:13, 15; 1 Pet. 1:7), and
      of eternal punishment (Matt. 5:22; Mark 9:44; Rev. 14:10;
      21:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the Holy Ghost is likened unto fire (Matt.
      3:11). His descent was denoted by the appearance of tongues
      as of fire (Acts 2:3).

      &quot;censer&quot; Lev. 10:1; 16:12). It was probably a
      metallic cinder-basin used for the purpose of carrying live
      coal for burning incense, and of carrying away the snuff in

      firmamentum, which is used as the translation of the Hebrew
      <i>raki&#39;a</i>. This word means simply
      &quot;expansion.&quot; It denotes the space or expanse like
      an arch appearing immediately above us. They who rendered
      <i>raki&#39;a</i> by firmamentum regarded it as a solid
      body. The language of Scripture is not scientific but
      popular, and hence we read of the sun rising and setting,
      and also here the use of this particular word. It is plain
      that it was used to denote solidity as well as expansion.
      It formed a division between the waters above and the
      waters below (Gen. 1:7). The <i>raki&#39;a</i> supported
      the upper reservoir (Ps. 148:4). It was the support also of
      the heavenly bodies (Gen. 1:14), and is spoken of as having
      &quot;windows&quot; and &quot;doors&quot; (Gen. 7:11; Isa.
      24:18; Mal. 3:10) through which the rain and snow might

      first-born&quot; signifies the church of the redeemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The destruction of the first-born was the last of the ten
      plagues inflicted on the Egyptians (Ex. 11:1-8; 12:29, 30).
    </p>
    <p>
      Menephtah is probably the Pharaoh whose first-born was
      slain. His son did not succeed or survive his father, but
      died early. The son&#39;s tomb has been found at Thebes
      unfinished, showing it was needed earlier than was
      expected. Some of the records on the tomb are as follows:
      &quot;The son whom Menephtah loves; who draws towards him
      his father&#39;s heart, the singer, the prince of archers,
      who governed Egypt on behalf of his father. Dead.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0001340"><b>First-born, Redemption of -</b> From
      the beginning the office of the priesthood in each family
      belonged to the eldest son. But when the extensive plan of
      sacrificial worship was introduced, requiring a company of
      men to be exclusively devoted to this ministry, the
      primitive office of the first-born was superseded by that
      of the Levites (Num. 3:11-13), and it was ordained that the
      first-born of man and of unclean animals should henceforth
      be redeemed (18:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The laws concerning this redemption of the first-born of
      man are recorded in Ex. 13:12-15; 22:29; 34:20; Num. 3:45;
      8:17; 18:16; Lev. 12:2, 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first-born male of every clean animal was to be given
      up to the priest for sacrifice (Deut. 12:6; Ex. 13:12;
      34:20; Num. 18:15-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first-born of unclean animals was either to be
      redeemed or sold and the price given to the priest (Lev.
      27:11-13, 27). The first-born of an ass, if not redeemed,
      was to be put to death (Ex. 13:13; 34:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001341"><b>First-born, Sanctification of the -</b> A peculiar sanctity was attached to the first-born
      both of man and of cattle. God claimed that the first-born
      males of man and of animals should be consecrated to him,
      the one as a priest (Ex. 19:22, 24), representing the
      family to which he belonged, and the other to be offered up
      in sacrifice (Gen. 4:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001342"><b>First-fruits -</b> The first-fruits
      of the ground were offered unto God just as the first-born
      of man and animals.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The law required, (1.) That on the morrow after the
      Passover Sabbath a sheaf of new corn should be waved by the
      priest before the altar (Lev. 23:5, 6, 10, 12; 2:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) That at the feast of Pentecost two loaves of leavened
      bread, made from the new flour, were to be waved in like
      manner (Lev. 23:15, 17; Num. 28:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The feast of Tabernacles was an acknowledgement that
      the fruits of the harvest were from the Lord (Ex. 23:16;
      34:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Every individual, besides, was required to consecrate
      to God a portion of the first-fruits of the land (Ex.
      22:29; 23:19; 34:26; Num. 15:20, 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The law enjoined that no fruit was to be gathered from
      newly-planted fruit-trees for the first three years, and
      that the first-fruits of the fourth year were to be
      consecrated to the Lord (Lev. 19:23-25). Jeremiah (2:3)
      alludes to the ordinance of &quot;first-fruits,&quot; and
      hence he must have been acquainted with the books of
      Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where the laws regarding it
      are recorded.

      Hebrews, a word denoting great fecundity (Gen. 9:2; Num.
      11:22; Jonah 2:1, 10). No fish is mentioned by name either
      in the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in the
      Mediterranean and in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the
      Hebrews were no doubt acquainted with many species. Two of
      the villages on the shores of the Sea of Galilee derived
      their names from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the
      &quot;house of fish&quot;) on the east and on the west.
      There is probably no other sheet of water in the world of
      equal dimensions that contains such a variety and profusion
      of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have been
      found. Some of the fishes are of a European type, such as
      the roach, the barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly
      African and tropical, such as the eel-like silurus. There
      was a regular fish-market apparently in Jerusalem (2 Chr.
      33:14; Neh. 3:3; 12:39; Zeph. 1:10), as there was a
      fish-gate which was probably contiguous to it.</a>

      It was from the fishing-nets that Jesus called his

      rebuked the winds and the waves (Matt. 8:26) and delivered
      that remarkable series of prophecies recorded in Matt. 13.
      He twice miraculously fed multitudes with fish and bread
      (Matt. 14:19; 15:36). It was in the mouth of a fish that
      the tribute-money was found (Matt. 17:27). And he &quot;ate
      a piece of broiled fish&quot; with his disciples after his
      resurrection (Luke 24:42, 43; comp. Acts 1:3). At the Sea
      of Tiberias (John 21:1-14), in obedience to his direction,
      the disciples cast their net &quot;on the right side of the
      ship,&quot; and enclosed so many that &quot;they were not
      able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      Two kinds of fishing-nets are mentioned in the New

      (1.) The casting-net (Matt. 4:18; Mark 1:16).

    <p>
      (2.) The drag-net or seine (Matt. 13:48).

      Revised Version, &quot;cakes of raisins&quot; in all these
      passages. In Isa. 22:24 it is the rendering of the Hebrew
      <i>nebel</i>, which properly means a bottle or vessel of
      skin. (Comp. 1 Sam. 1:24; 10:3; 25:18; 2 Sam. 16:1, where
      the same Hebrew word is used.)</a>

      symbol of the holiness of God (Ex. 3:2; Rev. 2:18), as

      <a name="T0001352"><b>Flax -</b> (Heb. pishtah, i.e.,
      &quot;peeled&quot;, in allusion to the fact that the stalks
      of flax when dried were first split or peeled before being
      steeped in water for the purpose of destroying the pulp).
      This plant was cultivated from earliest times. The flax of
      Egypt was destroyed by the plague of hail when it &quot;was
      bolled&quot;, i.e., was forming pods for seed (Ex. 9:31).
      It was extensively cultivated both in Egypt and Palestine.
      Reference is made in Josh. 2:6 to the custom of drying
      flax-stalks by exposing them to the sun on the flat roofs
      of houses. It was much used in forming articles of clothing
      such as girdles, also cords and bands (Lev. 13:48, 52, 59;
      Deut. 22:11). (See <a href=

      Adullam thus addressed his persecutor Saul (1 Sam. 24:14):
      &quot;After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom
      dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?&quot; He
      thus speaks of himself as the poor, contemptible object of
      the monarch&#39;s pursuit, a &quot;worthy object truly for
      an expedition of the king of Israel with his picked
      troops!&quot; This insect is in Eastern language the
      popular emblem of insignificance. In 1 Sam. 26:20 the LXX.
      read &quot;come out to seek my life&quot; instead of
      &quot;to seek a flea.&quot;</a>

      whether shorn off or still attached to the skin (Deut.
      18:4; Job 31:20). The miracle of Gideon&#39;s fleece (Judg.
      6:37-40) consisted in the dew having fallen at one time on
      the fleece without any on the floor, and at another time in
      the fleece remaining dry while the ground was wet with
      dew.</a>

      <a name="T0001355"><b>Flesh -</b> in the Old Testament
      denotes (1) a particular part of the body of man and
      animals (Gen. 2:21; 41:2; Ps. 102:5, marg.); (2) the whole
      body (Ps. 16:9); (3) all living things having flesh, and
      particularly humanity as a whole (Gen. 6:12, 13); (4)
      mutability and weakness (2 Chr. 32:8; comp. Isa. 31:3; Ps.
      78:39). As suggesting the idea of softness it is used in
      the expression &quot;heart of flesh&quot; (Ezek. 11:19).
      The expression &quot;my flesh and bone&quot; (Judg. 9:2;
      Isa. 58:7) denotes relationship.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament, besides these it is also used to
      denote the sinful element of human nature as opposed to the
      &quot;Spirit&quot; (Rom. 6:19; Matt. 16:17). Being &quot;in
      the flesh&quot; means being unrenewed (Rom. 7:5; 8:8, 9),
      and to live &quot;according to the flesh&quot; is to live
      and act sinfully (Rom. 8:4, 5, 7, 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      This word also denotes the human nature of Christ (John
      1:14, &quot;The Word was made flesh.&quot; Comp. also 1
      Tim. 3:16; Rom. 1:3).
    </p>

      <a name="T0001356"><b>Flesh-hook -</b> a many-pronged fork
      used in the sacrificial services (1 Sam. 2:13, 14; Ex.
      27:3; 38:3) by the priest in drawing away the flesh. The
      fat of the sacrifice, together with the breast and shoulder
      (Lev. 7:29-34), were presented by the worshipper to the
      priest. The fat was burned on the alter (3:3-5), and the
      breast and shoulder became the portion of the priests. But
      Hophni and Phinehas, not content with this, sent a servant
      to seize with a flesh-hook a further portion.</a>

      and valleys of the wilderness of the forty years&#39;
      wanderings. In Isa. 50:7 and Ezek. 3:9 the expressions,
      where the word is used, means that the &quot;Messiah would
      be firm and resolute amidst all contempt and scorn which he
      would meet; that he had made up his mind to endure it, and
      would not shrink from any kind or degree of suffering which
      would be necessary to accomplish the great work in which he
      was engaged.&quot; (Comp. Ezek. 3:8, 9.) The words
      &quot;like a flint&quot; are used with reference to the
      hoofs of horses (Isa. 5:28).</a>

      DELUGE</a>.) In Josh. 24:2, 3, 14, 15, the word
      &quot;flood&quot; (R.V., &quot;river&quot;) means the river
      Euphrates. In Ps. 66:6, this word refers to the river
      Jordan.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001359"><b>Flour -</b> Grain reduced to the form
      of meal is spoken of in the time of Abraham (Gen. 18:6). As
      baking was a daily necessity, grain was also ground daily
      at the mills (Jer. 25:10). The flour mingled with water was
      kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven (Ex.
      12:34) was added and sometimes omitted (Gen. 19:3). The
      dough was then formed into thin cakes nine or ten inches in
      diameter and baked in the oven.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine flour was offered by the poor as a sin-offering (Lev.
      5:11-13), and also in connection with other sacrifices
      (Num. 15:3-12; 28:7-29).

    <p>
      <a name="T0001360"><b>Flowers -</b> Very few species of
      flowers are mentioned in the Bible although they abounded
      in Palestine. It has been calculated that in Western Syria
      and Palestine from two thousand to two thousand five
      hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred
      probably are British wild-flowers. Their beauty is often
      alluded to (Cant. 2:12; Matt. 6:28). They are referred to
      as affording an emblem of the transitory nature of human
      life (Job 14:2; Ps. 103:15; Isa. 28:1; 40:6; James 1:10).
      Gardens containing flowers and fragrant herbs are spoken of
      (Cant. 4:16; 6:2).</a>

      <a name="T0001361"><b>Flute -</b> a musical instrument,
      probably composed of a number of pipes, mentioned Dan. 3:5,
      7, 10, 15.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Matt. 9:23, 24, notice is taken of players on the flute,
      here called &quot;minstrels&quot; (but in R.V.
      &quot;flute-players&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutes were in common use among the ancient Egyptians.

    <p>
      <a name="T0001362"><b>Fly -</b> Heb. zebub, (Eccl. 10:1;
      Isa. 7:18). This fly was so grievous a pest that the
      Phoenicians invoked against it the aid of their god
      Baal-zebub (q.v.). The prophet Isaiah (7:18) alludes to
      some poisonous fly which was believed to be found on the
      confines of Egypt, and which would be called by the Lord.
      Poisonous flies exist in many parts of Africa, for
      instance, the different kinds of tsetse.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Heb. &#39;arob, the name given to the insects sent as a
      plague on the land of Egypt (Ex. 8:21-31; Ps. 78:45;
      105:31). The LXX. render this by a word which means the
      &quot;dog-fly,&quot; the cynomuia. The Jewish commentators
      regarded the Hebrew word here as connected with the word
      <i>&#39;arab</i>, which means &quot;mingled;&quot; and they
      accordingly supposed the plague to consist of a mixed
      multitude of animals, beasts, reptiles, and insects. But
      there is no doubt that &quot;the <i>&#39;arab</i>&quot;
      denotes a single definite species. Some interpreters regard
      it as the Blatta orientalis, the cockroach, a species of
      beetle. These insects &quot;inflict very painful bites with
      their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture,
      leather, and articles of every kind, and either consume or
      render unavailable all eatables.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001363"><b>Foam -</b> (Hos. 10:7), the rendering
      of <i>ketseph</i>, which properly means twigs or splinters
      (as rendered in the LXX. and marg. R.V.). The expression in
      Hosea may therefore be read, &quot;as a chip on the face of
      the water,&quot; denoting the helplessness of the piece of
      wood as compared with the irresistable current.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001364"><b>Fodder -</b> Heb. belil, (Job 6:5),
      meaning properly a mixture or medley (Lat. farrago),
      &quot;made up of various kinds of grain, as wheat, barley,
      vetches, and the like, all mixed together, and then sown or
      given to cattle&quot; (Job 24:6, A.V. &quot;corn,&quot;
      R.V. &quot;provender;&quot; Isa. 30:24,

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001365"><b>Fold -</b> an enclosure for flocks to
      rest together (Isa. 13:20). Sheep-folds are mentioned Num.
      32:16, 24, 36; 2 Sam. 7:8; Zeph. 2:6; John 10:1, etc. It
      was prophesied of the cities of Ammon (Ezek. 25:5), Aroer
      (Isa. 17:2), and Judaea, that they would be folds or
      couching-places for flocks. &quot;Among the pots,&quot; of
      the Authorized Version (Ps. 68:13), is rightly in the
      Revised Version, &quot;among the sheepfolds.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001366"><b>Food -</b> Originally the Creator
      granted the use of the vegetable world for food to man
      (Gen. 1:29), with the exception mentioned (2:17). The use
      of animal food was probably not unknown to the
      antediluvians. There is, however, a distinct law on the
      subject given to Noah after the Deluge (Gen. 9:2-5).
      Various articles of food used in the patriarchal age are
      mentioned in Gen. 18:6-8; 25:34; 27:3, 4; 43:11. Regarding
      the food of the Israelites in Egypt, see Ex. 16:3; Num.
      11:5. In the wilderness their ordinary food was
      miraculously supplied in the manna. They had also quails
      (Ex. 16:11-13; Num. 11:31).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the
      animals to be used for food (Lev. 11; Deut. 14:3-21). The
      Jews were also forbidden to use as food anything that had
      been consecrated to idols (Ex. 34:15), or animals that had
      died of disease or had been torn by wild beasts (Ex. 22:31;
      Lev. 22:8). (See also for other restrictions Ex. 23:19;
      29:13-22; Lev. 3:4-9; 9:18, 19; 22:8; Deut. 14:21.) But
      beyond these restrictions they had a large grant from God
      (Deut. 14:26; 32:13, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Food was prepared for use in various ways. The cereals were
      sometimes eaten without any preparation (Lev. 23:14; Deut.
      23:25; 2 Kings 4:42). Vegetables were cooked by boiling
      (Gen. 25:30, 34; 2 Kings 4:38, 39), and thus also other
      articles of food were prepared for use (Gen. 27:4; Prov.
      23:3; Ezek. 24:10; Luke 24:42; John 21:9). Food was also
      prepared by roasting (Ex. 12:8; Lev. 2:14). (See <a href=

      throne (2 Chr. 9:18). Jehovah symbolically dwelt in the
      holy place between the cherubim above the ark of the
      covenant. The ark was his footstool (1 Chr. 28:2; Ps. 99:5;
      132:7). And as heaven is God&#39;s throne, so the earth is
      his footstool (Ps. 110:1; Isa. 66:1; Matt. 5:35).</a>

      60:5, 11; R.V., &quot;the wealth of the nations&quot;)
      denotes the wealth of the heathen. The whole passage means
      that the wealth of the Gentile world should be consecrated
      to the service of the church.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001369"><b>Ford -</b> Mention is frequently made
      of the fords of the Jordan (Josh. 2:7; Judg. 3:28; 12:5,
      6), which must have been very numerous; about fifty
      perhaps. The most notable was that of Bethabara. Mention is
      also made of the ford of the Jabbok (Gen. 32:22), and of
      the fords of Arnon (Isa. 16:2) and of the Euphrates (Jer.
      51:32).</a>

      among Oriental nations of colouring the forehead or
      impressing on it some distinctive mark as a sign of
      devotion to some deity is alluded to in Rev. 13:16, 17;
      14:9; 17:5; 20:4.</a>

    <p>
      The &quot;jewel on thy forehead&quot; mentioned in Ezek.
      16:12 (R.V., &quot;a ring upon thy nose&quot;) was in all
      probability the &quot;nose-ring&quot; (Isa. 3:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ezek. 3:7 the word &quot;impudent&quot; is rightly
      rendered in the Revised Version &quot;an hard

      23:22; Deut. 14:28; 16:10, 11; 24:19). They enjoyed in many
      things equal rights with the native-born residents (Ex.
      12:49; Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15; 35:15), but were not allowed
      to do anything which was an abomination according to the
      Jewish law (Ex. 20:10; Lev. 17:15,16; 18:26; 20:2; 24:16,

      Rom. 8:29; 11:2; 1 Pet. 1:2), one of those high attributes
      essentially appertaining to him the full import of which we
      cannot comprehend. In the most absolute sense his knowledge
      is infinite (1 Sam. 23:9-13; Jer. 38:17-23; 42:9-22, Matt.

      primeval forests of Syria (Eccl. 2:6; Isa. 44:14; Jer. 5:6;
      Micah 5:8). The most extensive was the trans-Jordanic
      forest of Ephraim (2 Sam. 18:6, 8; Josh. 17:15, 18), which
      is probably the same as the wood of Ephratah (Ps. 132:6),
      some part of the great forest of Gilead. It was in this
      forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to
      the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the
      fury of Saul (1 Sam. 22:5). We read also of the forest of
      Bethel (2 Kings 2:23, 24), and of that which the Israelites
      passed in their pursuit of the Philistines (1 Sam. 14:25),
      and of the forest of the cedars of Lebanon (1 Kings 4:33; 2

      &quot;The house of the forest of Lebanon (1 Kings 7:2;

      from Lebanon, and they had the appearance of a forest. (See

      a safe hiding-place. place. This word is rendered
      &quot;forest&quot; only in 2 Chr. 27:4. It is also rendered
      &quot;wood&quot;, the &quot;wood&quot; in the
      &quot;wilderness of Ziph,&quot; in which david concealed
      himself (1 Sam. 23:15), which lay south-east of Hebron. In

      &quot;The forest of the vintage&quot; (Zech. 11:2,
      &quot;inaccessible forest,&quot; or R.V. &quot;strong
      forest&quot;) is probably a figurative allusion to
      Jerusalem, or the verse may simply point to the devastation
      of the region referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forest is an image of unfruitfulness as contrasted with
      a cultivated field (Isa. 29:17; 32:15; Jer. 26:18; Hos.
      2:12). Isaiah (10:19, 33, 34) likens the Assyrian host

      that on account of the work of Christ, i.e., he removes the
      guilt of sin, or the sinner&#39;s actual liability to
      eternal wrath on account of it. All sins are forgiven
      freely (Acts 5:31; 13:38; 1 John 1:6-9). The sinner is by
      this act of grace for ever freed from the guilt and penalty
      of his sins. This is the peculiar prerogative of God (Ps.

      &quot;eye&quot; of the water desert), a natural source of
      living water. Palestine was a &quot;land of brooks of
      water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys
      and hills&quot; (Deut. 8:7; 11:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      These fountains, bright sparkling &quot;eyes&quot; of the
      desert, are remarkable for their abundance and their
      beauty, especially on the west of Jordan. All the perennial
      rivers and streams of the country are supplied from
      fountains, and depend comparatively little on surface
      water. &quot;Palestine is a country of mountains and hills,
      and it abounds in fountains of water. The murmur of these
      waters is heard in every dell, and the luxuriant foliage
      which surrounds them is seen in every plain.&quot; Besides
      its rain-water, its cisterns and fountains, Jerusalem had
      also an abundant supply of water in the magnificent
      reservoir called &quot;Solomon&#39;s Pools&quot; (q.v.), at
      the head of the Urtas valley, whence it was conveyed to the
      city by subterrean channels some 10 miles in length. These
      have all been long ago destroyed, so that no water from the
      &quot;Pools&quot; now reaches Jerusalem. Only one fountain
      has been discovered at Jerusalem, the so-called
      &quot;Virgins&#39;s Fountains,&quot; in the valley of
      Kidron; and only one well (Heb. beer), the Bir Eyub, also
      in the valley of Kidron, south of the King&#39;s Gardens,
      which has been dug through the solid rock. The inhabitants
      of Jerusalem are now mainly dependent on the winter rains,
      which they store in cisterns. (See <a href=

      supplied, the waters flowing in a copious stream to it
      through a tunnel cut through the rock, the actual length of
      which is 1,750 feet. The spring rises in a cave 20 feet by
      7. A serpentine tunnel 67 feet long runs from it toward the
      left, off which the tunnel to the Pool of Siloam branches.
      It is the only unfailing fountain in Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fountain received its name from the &quot;fantastic
      legend&quot; that here the virgin washed the
      swaddling-clothes of our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spring has the singular characteristic of being
      intermittent, flowing from three to five times daily in
      winter, twice daily in summer, and only once daily in
      autumn. This peculiarity is accounted for by the
      supposition that the outlet from the reservoir is by a
      passage in the form of a siphon.

      17:20; Eccl. 9:12. Birds of all kinds abound in Palestine,
      and the capture of these for the table and for other uses
      formed the employment of many persons. The traps and snares
      used for this purpose are mentioned Hos. 5:1; Prov. 7:23;
      22:5; Amos 3:5; Ps. 69:22; comp. Deut. 22:6, 7.</a>

      <a name="T0001381"><b>Fox -</b> (Heb. shu&#39;al, a name
      derived from its digging or burrowing under ground), the
      Vulpes thaleb, or Syrian fox, the only species of this
      animal indigenous to Palestine. It burrows, is silent and
      solitary in its habits, is destructive to vineyards, being
      a plunderer of ripe grapes (Cant. 2:15). The Vulpes
      Niloticus, or Egyptian dog-fox, and the Vulpes vulgaris, or
      common fox, are also found in Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The proverbial cunning of the fox is alluded to in Ezek.
      13:4, and in Luke 13:32, where our Lord calls Herod
      &quot;that fox.&quot; In Judg. 15:4, 5, the reference is in
      all probability to the jackal. The Hebrew word <i>
      shu&#39;al_ through the Persian _schagal</i> becomes our
      jackal (Canis aureus), so that the word may bear that
      signification here. The reasons for preferring the
      rendering &quot;jackal&quot; are (1) that it is more easily
      caught than the fox; (2) that the fox is shy and
      suspicious, and flies mankind, while the jackal does not;
      and (3) that foxes are difficult, jackals comparatively
      easy, to treat in the way here described. Jackals hunt in
      large numbers, and are still very numerous in Southern
      Palestine.

      imported from Arabia (Isa. 60:6; Jer. 6:20), yet also
      growing in Palestine (Cant. 4:14). It was one of the
      ingredients in the perfume of the sanctuary (Ex. 30:34),
      and was used as an accompaniment of the meat-offering (Lev.
      2:1, 16; 6:15; 24:7). When burnt it emitted a fragrant
      odour, and hence the incense became a symbol of the Divine
      name (Mal. 1:11; Cant. 1:3) and an emblem of prayer (Ps.
      141:2; Luke 1:10; Rev. 5:8; 8:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This frankincense, or olibanum, used by the Jews in the
      temple services is not to be confounded with the
      frankincense of modern commerce, which is an exudation of
      the Norway spruce fir, the Pinus abies. It was probably a
      resin from the Indian tree known to botanists by the name
      of Boswellia serrata or thurifera, which grows to the
      height of forty feet.

      <a name="T0001383"><b>Freedom -</b> The law of Moses
      pointed out the cases in which the servants of the Hebrews

      25:39-42, 47-55; Deut. 15:12-18). Under the Roman law the
      &quot;freeman&quot; (ingenuus) was one born free; the
      &quot;freedman&quot; (libertinus) was a manumitted slave,
      and had not equal rights with the freeman (Acts 22:28;

      Ps. 78:45; 105:30).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament this word occurs only in Rev. 16:13,
      where it is referred to as a symbol of uncleanness. The
      only species of frog existing in Palestine is the green
      frog (Rana esculenta), the well-known edible frog of the
      Continent.

      <a name="T0001386"><b>Frontlets -</b> occurs only in Ex.

      given them, that they should &quot;bind them for a sign
      upon their hand, and have them as frontlets between their
      eyes,&quot; was that they should keep them distinctly in
      view and carefully attend to them. But soon after their
      return from Babylon they began to interpret this injunction
      literally, and had accordingly portions of the law written
      out and worn about their person. These they called
      tephillin, i.e., &quot;prayers.&quot; The passages so
      written out on strips of parchment were these, Ex. 12:2-10;
      13:11-21; Deut. 6:4-9; 11:18-21. They were then
      &quot;rolled up in a case of black calfskin, which was
      attached to a stiffer piece of leather, having a thong one
      finger broad and one cubit and a half long. Those worn on
      the forehead were written on four strips of parchment, and
      put into four little cells within a square case, which had
      on it the Hebrew letter called shin, the three points of
      which were regarded as an emblem of God.&quot; This case
      tied around the forehead in a particular way was called
      &quot;the tephillah on the head.&quot; (See <a href=
