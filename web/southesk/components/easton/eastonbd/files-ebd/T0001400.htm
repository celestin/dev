      Shechem against Abimelech; but was defeated, and fled to

      covered with a tesselated &quot;pavement&quot; (Gr.
      lithostroton, i.e., &quot;stone-paved&quot;). A
      judgement-seat (bema) was placed on this
      &quot;pavement&quot; outside the hall of the
      &quot;praetorium&quot; (q.v.), the judgment-hall (John

    <p>
       The tribe of Gad during the march through the wilderness
      had their place with Simeon and Reuben on the south side of
      the tabernacle (Num. 2:14). The tribes of Reuben and Gad
      continued all through their history to follow the pastoral
      pursuits of the patriarchs (Num. 32:1-5).
    </p>
    <p>
       The portion allotted to the tribe of Gad was on the east
      of Jordan, and comprehended the half of Gilead, a region of
      great beauty and fertility (Deut. 3:12), bounded on the
      east by the Arabian desert, on the west by the Jordan
      (Josh. 13:27), and on the north by the river Jabbok. It
      thus included the whole of the Jordan valley as far north
      as to the Sea of Galilee, where it narrowed almost to a
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
       This tribe was fierce and warlike; they were &quot;strong
      men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle
      shield and buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and
      like roes upon the mountains for swiftness&quot; (1 Chr.
      12:8; 5:19-22). Barzillai (2 Sam. 17:27) and Elijah (1
      Kings 17:1) were of this tribe. It was carried into
      captivity at the same time as the other tribes of the
      northern kingdom by Tiglath-pileser (1 Chr. 5:26), and in
      the time of Jeremiah (49:1) their cities were inhabited by
      the Ammonites.

    <p>
       (2.) A prophet who joined David in the &quot;hold,&quot;
      and at whose advice he quitted it for the forest of Hareth
      (1 Chr. 29:29; 2 Chr. 29:25; 1 Sam. 22:5). Many years after
      we find mention made of him in connection with the
      punishment inflicted for numbering the people (2 Sam.
      24:11-19; 1 Chr. 21:9-19). He wrote a book called the
      &quot;Acts of David&quot; (1 Chr. 29:29), and assisted in
      the arrangements for the musical services of the
      &quot;house of God&quot; (2 Chr. 29:25). He bore the title
      of &quot;the king&#39;s seer&quot; (2 Sam. 24:11, 13; 1
      Chr. 21:9).

       <a name="T0001406"><b>Gadara -</b> the capital of the
      Roman province of Peraea. It stood on the summit of a
      mountain about 6 miles south-east of the Sea of Galilee.
      Mark (5:1) and Luke (8:26-39) describe the miracle of the
      healing of the demoniac (Matthew [8:28-34] says two
      demoniacs) as having been wrought &quot;in the country of
      the Gadarenes,&quot; thus describing the scene generally.
      The miracle could not have been wrought at Gadara itself,
      for between the lake and this town there is the deep,
      almost impassable ravine of the Hieromax (Jarmuk). It is
      identified with the modern village of Um-Keis, which is
      surrounded by very extensive ruins, all bearing testimony
      to the splendour of ancient Gadara.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;The most interesting remains of Gadara are its
      tombs, which dot the cliffs for a considerable distance
      round the city, chiefly on the north-east declivity; but
      many beautifully sculptured sarcophagi are scattered over
      the surrounding heights. They are excavated in the
      limestone rock, and consist of chambers of various
      dimensions, some more than 20 feet square, with recesses in
      the sides for bodies...The present inhabitants of Um-Keis
      are all troglodytes, &#39;dwelling in tombs,&#39; like the
      poor maniacs of old, and occasionally they are almost as
      dangerous to unprotected travellers.&quot;

      Paul&#39;s fellow-traveller, and his host at Corinth when
      he wrote his Epistle to the Romans (16:23). He with his
      household were baptized by Paul (1 Cor. 1:14). During a
      heathen outbreak against Paul at Ephesus the mob seized
      Gaius and Aristarchus because they could not find Paul, and
      rushed with them into the theatre. Some have identified
      this Gaius with No. (2).</a>

       <a name="T0001412"><b>Galatia -</b> has been called the
      &quot;Gallia&quot; of the East, Roman writers calling its
      inhabitants Galli. They were an intermixture of Gauls and
      Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci, and the country
      Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part of
      that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about
      B.C. 280. They were invited by the king of Bithynia to
      cross over into Asia Minor to assist him in his wars. There
      they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh
      accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran
      Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering
      neighbouring countries. They were great warriors, and hired
      themselves out as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on
      both sides in the great battles of the times. They were at
      length brought under the power of Rome in B.C. 189, and
      Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       This province of Galatia, within the limits of which these
      Celtic tribes were confined, was the central region of Asia
      Minor.
    </p>
    <p>
       During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by
      Silas and Timothy (Acts 16:6), visited the &quot;region of
      Galatia,&quot; where he was detained by sickness (Gal.
      4:13), and had thus the longer opportunity of preaching to
      them the gospel. On his third journey he went over
      &quot;all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order&quot;
      (Acts 18:23). Crescens was sent thither by Paul toward the
      close of his life (2 Tim. 4:10).
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001413"><b>Galatians, Epistle to -</b> The
      genuineness of this epistle is not called in question. Its
      Pauline origin is universally acknowledged.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       Occasion of. The churches of Galatia were founded by Paul
      himself (Acts 16:6; Gal. 1:8; 4:13, 19). They seem to have
      been composed mainly of converts from heathenism (4:8), but
      partly also of Jewish converts, who probably, under the
      influence of Judaizing teachers, sought to incorporate the
      rites of Judaism with Christianity, and by their active
      zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the churches
      to adopt their views (1:6; 3:1). This epistle was written
      for the purpose of counteracting this Judaizing tendency,
      and of recalling the Galatians to the simplicity of the
      gospel, and at the same time also of vindicating Paul&#39;s
      claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.
    </p>
    <p>
       Time and place of writing. The epistle was probably
      written very soon after Paul&#39;s second visit to Galatia
      (Acts 18:23). The references of the epistle appear to agree
      with this conclusion. The visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in
      Gal. 2:1-10, was identical with that of Acts 15, and it is
      spoken of as a thing of the past, and consequently the
      epistle was written subsequently to the council of
      Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and that to
      the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both
      written at the same time, namely, in the winter of A.D.
      57-8, during Paul&#39;s stay in Corinth (Acts 20:2, 3).
      This to the Galatians is written on the urgency of the
      occasion, tidings having reached him of the state of
      matters; and that to the Romans in a more deliberate and
      systematic way, in exposition of the same great doctrines
      of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
       Contents of. The great question discussed is, Was the
      Jewish law binding on Christians? The epistle is designed
      to prove against the Jews that men are justified by faith
      without the works of the law of Moses. After an
      introductory address (Gal. 1:1-10) the apostle discusses
      the subjects which had occasioned the epistle. (1) He
      defends his apostolic authority (1:11-19; 2:1-14); (2)
      shows the evil influence of the Judaizers in destroying the
      very essence of the gospel (3 and 4); (3) exhorts the
      Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in
      Jesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a
      right use of their Christian freedom (5-6:1-10); (4) and
      then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed, and
      with the benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans taken
      together &quot;form a complete proof that justification is
      not to be obtained meritoriously either by works of
      morality or by rites and ceremonies, though of divine
      appointment; but that it is a free gift, proceeding
      entirely from the mercy of God, to those who receive it by
      faith in Jesus our Lord.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       In the conclusion of the epistle (6:11) Paul says,
      &quot;Ye see how large a letter I have written with mine
      own hand.&quot; It is implied that this was different from
      his ordinary usage, which was simply to write the
      concluding salutation with his own hand, indicating that
      the rest of the epistle was written by another hand.
      Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on
      the epistle, says: &quot;At this point the apostle takes
      the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph
      is written with his own hand. From the time when letters
      began to be forged in his name (2 Thess. 2:2; 3:17) it
      seems to have been his practice to close with a few words
      in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such
      forgeries...In the present case he writes a whole
      paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in
      terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in
      large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his
      hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of
      his soul.&quot; (See <a href=

       <a name="T0001415"><b>Galeed -</b> heap of witness, the
      name of the pile of stones erected by Jacob and Laban to
      mark the league of friendship into which they entered with
      each other (Gen. 31:47, 48). This was the name given to the
      &quot;heap&quot; by Jacob. It is Hebrew, while the name
      Jegar-sahadutha, given to it by Laban, is Aramaic (Chaldee
      or Syriac). Probably Nahor&#39;s family originally spoke
      Aramaic, and Abraham and his descendants learned Hebrew, a
      kindred dialect, in the land of Canaan.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001416"><b>Galilean -</b> an inhabitant or
      native of Galilee. This word was used as a name of contempt
      as applied to our Lord&#39;s disciples (Luke 22:59; Acts
      2:7). All the apostles, with the exception of Judas
      Iscariot (Acts 1:11), were Galileans. Peter was detected by
      his Galilean accent (Matt. 26:69; Mark 14:70).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       This was also one of the names of reproach given to the
      early Christians. Julian the Apostate, as he is called, not
      only used the epithet himself when referring to Christ and
      his apostles, but he made it a law that no one should ever
      call the Christians by any other name.

    <p>
       <a name="T0001417"><b>Galilee -</b> circuit. Solomon
      rewarded Hiram for certain services rendered him by the
      gift of an upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali.
      Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called it
      &quot;the land of Cabul&quot; (q.v.). The Jews called it
      Galil. It continued long to be occupied by the original
      inhabitants, and hence came to be called &quot;Galilee of
      the Gentiles&quot; (Matt. 4:15), and also &quot;Upper
      Galilee,&quot; to distinguish it from the extensive
      addition afterwards made to it toward the south, which was
      usually called &quot;Lower Galilee.&quot; In the time of
      our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third of Western
      Palestine, extending &quot;from Dan on the north, at the
      base of Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on
      the south, and from the Jordan valley on the east away
      across the splendid plains of Jezreel and Acre to the
      shores of the Mediterranean on the west.&quot; Palestine
      was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and
      Galilee, which comprehended the whole northern section of
      the country (Acts 9:31), and was the largest of the
      three.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       It was the scene of some of the most memorable events of
      Jewish history. Galilee also was the home of our Lord
      during at least thirty years of his life. The first three
      Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord&#39;s public
      ministry in this province. &quot;The entire province is
      encircled with a halo of holy associations connected with
      the life, works, and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;
      &quot;It is noteworthy that of his thirty-two beautiful
      parables, no less than ninteen were spoken in Galilee. And
      it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three
      great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province.
      His first miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of
      Galilee, and his last, after his resurrection, on the shore
      of Galilee&#39;s sea. In Galilee our Lord delivered the
      Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on &#39;The Bread
      of Life,&#39; on &#39;Purity,&#39; on
      &#39;Forgiveness,&#39; and on &#39;Humility.&#39; In
      Galilee he called his first disciples; and there occurred
      the sublime scene of the Transfiguration&quot;
      (Porter&#39;s Through Samaria).
    </p>
    <p>
       When the Sanhedrin were about to proceed with some plan
      for the condemnation of our Lord (John 7:45-52), Nicodemus
      interposed in his behalf. (Comp. Deut. 1:16,17; 17:8.) They
      replied, &quot;Art thou also of Galilee?.... Out of Galilee
      ariseth no prophet.&quot; This saying of theirs was
      &quot;not historically true, for two prophets at least had
      arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest
      of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also
      Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose
      sight of historical accuracy&quot; (Alford, Com.).
    </p>
    <p>
       The Galilean accent differed from that of Jerusalem in
      being broader and more guttural (Mark 14:70).
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001418"><b>Galilee, Sea of -</b> (Matt. 4:18;
      15:29), is mentioned in the Bible under three other names.
      (1.) In the Old Testament it is called the &quot;sea of
      Chinnereth&quot; (Num. 34:11; Josh. 12:3; 13:27), as is
      supposed from its harp-like shape. (2). The &quot;lake of
      Gennesareth&quot; once by Luke (5:1), from the flat
      district lying on its west coast. (3.) John (6:1; 21:1)
      calls it the &quot;sea of Tiberias&quot; (q.v.). The modern
      Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad.
      Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the
      Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan
      enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the
      Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this
      distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of
      1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27
      miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles
      north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and
      abounds in fish.
    </p>
    <p>
       Its present appearance is thus described: &quot;The utter
      loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are
      exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone
      to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How
      different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life
      and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that
      thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy
      population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the
      cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was
      dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white
      sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and
      shore. The cities are in ruins!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the
      public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, &quot;his own
      city&quot; (Matt. 9:1), stood on its shores. From among the
      fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose
      Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be
      disciples, and sent them forth to be &quot;fishers of
      men&quot; (Matt. 4:18,22; Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5: 1-11). He
      stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over
      it, &quot;Peace, be still&quot; (Matt. 8:23-27; Mark
      7:31-35); and here also he showed himself after his
      resurrection to his disciples (John 21).
    </p>
    <p>
       &quot;The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the
      gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake
      basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its
      waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of
      shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that
      they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish.
      The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake
      attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population
      than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded
      district was brought into contact with all parts of the
      world. And this large and varied population, with access to
      all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and
      induced him to make this spot the centre of his public
      ministry.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001419"><b>Gall -</b> (1) Heb. mererah, meaning
      &quot;bitterness&quot; (Job 16:13); i.e., the bile secreted
      in the liver. This word is also used of the poison of asps
      (20:14), and of the vitals, the seat of life (25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. rosh. In Deut. 32:33 and Job 20:16 it denotes
      the poison of serpents. In Hos. 10:4 the Hebrew word is
      rendered &quot;hemlock.&quot; The original probably denotes
      some bitter, poisonous plant, most probably the poppy,
      which grows up quickly, and is therefore coupled with
      wormwood (Deut. 29:18; Jer. 9:15; Lam. 3:19). Comp. Jer.
      8:14; 23:15, &quot;water of gall,&quot; Gesenius,
      &quot;poppy juice;&quot; others, &quot;water of
      hemlock,&quot; &quot;bitter water.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Gr. chole (Matt. 27:34), the LXX. translation of the
      Hebrew <i>rosh</i> in Ps. 69; 21, which foretells our
      Lord&#39;s sufferings. The drink offered to our Lord was
      vinegar (made of light wine rendered acid, the common drink
      of Roman soldiers) &quot;mingled with gall,&quot; or,
      according to Mark (15:23), &quot;mingled with myrrh;&quot;
      both expressions meaning the same thing, namely, that the
      vinegar was made bitter by the infusion of wormwood or some
      other bitter substance, usually given, according to a
      merciful custom, as an anodyne to those who were crucified,
      to render them insensible to pain. Our Lord, knowing this,
      refuses to drink it. He would take nothing to cloud his
      faculties or blunt the pain of dying. He chooses to suffer
      every element of woe in the bitter cup of agony given him
      by the Father (John 18:11).

      (Ezek. 41:15, 16), a terrace; a projection; ledge.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. rahit (Cant. 1:17), translated
      &quot;rafters,&quot; marg. &quot;galleries;&quot; probably
      panel-work or fretted ceiling.

      Isa. 10:30). The native place of Phalti, to whom Michal was
      given by Saul. It was probably in Benjamin, to the north of
      Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001422"><b>Gallio -</b> the elder brother of
      Seneca the philosopher, who was tutor and for some time
      minister of the emperor Nero. He was &quot;deputy&quot;,
      i.e., proconsul, as in Revised Version, of Achaia, under
      the emperor Claudius, when Paul visited Corinth (Acts
      18:12). The word used here by Luke in describing the rank
      of Gallio shows his accuracy. Achaia was a senatorial
      province under Claudius, and the governor of such a
      province was called a &quot;proconsul.&quot; He is spoken
      of by his contemporaries as &quot;sweet Gallio,&quot; and
      is described as a most popular and affectionate man. When
      the Jews brought Paul before his tribunal on the charge of
      persuading &quot;men to worship God contrary to the
      law&quot; (18:13), he refused to listen to them, and
      &quot;drave them from the judgment seat&quot; (18:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001423"><b>Gallows -</b> Heb. &#39;ets, meaning
      &quot;a tree&quot; (Esther 6:4), a post or gibbet. In Gen.
      40:19 and Deut. 21:22 the word is rendered
      &quot;tree.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001424"><b>Gamaliel -</b> reward of God. (1.) A
      chief of the tribe of Manasseh at the census at Sinai (Num.
      1:10; 2:20; 7:54, 59).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) The son of rabbi Simeon, and grandson of the famous
      rabbi Hillel. He was a Pharisse, and therefore the opponent
      of the party of the Sadducees. He was noted for his
      learning, and was president of the Sanhedrim during the
      regins of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, and died, it is
      said, about eighteen years before the destruction of
      Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
       When the apostles were brought before the council, charged
      with preaching the resurrection of Jesus, as a zealous
      Pharisee Gamaliel councelled moderation and calmness. By a
      reference to well-known events, he advised them to
      &quot;refrain from these men.&quot; If their work or
      counsel was of man, it would come to nothing; but if it was
      of God, they could not destroy it, and therefore ought to
      be on their guard lest they should be &quot;found fighting
      against God&quot; (Acts 5:34-40). Paul was one of his
      disciples (22:3).
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001425"><b>Games -</b> (1.) Of children (Zech.
      8:5; Matt. 11:16). The Jewish youth were also apparently
      instructed in the use of the bow and the sling (Judg.
      20:16; 1 Chr. 12:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Public games, such as were common among the Greeks
      and Romans, were foreign to the Jewish institutions and
      customs. Reference, however, is made to such games in two
      passages (Ps. 19:5; Eccl. 9:11).
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Among the Greeks and Romans games entered largely
      into their social life.
    </p>
    <p>
       (a) Reference in the New Testament is made to gladiatorial
      shows and fights with wild beasts (1 Cor. 15:32). These
      were common among the Romans, and sometimes on a large
      scale.
    </p>
    <p>
       (b) Allusion is frequently made to the Grecian gymnastic
      contests (Gal. 2:2; 5:7; Phil. 2:16; 3:14; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2
      Tim. 2:5; Heb. 12:1, 4, 12). These were very numerous. The
      Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games were esteemed
      as of great national importance, and the victors at any of
      these games of wrestling, racing, etc., were esteemed as
      the noblest and the happiest of mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001426"><b>Gammadim -</b> (Ezek. 27:11) brave
      warriors; R.V. marg., &quot;valorous men;&quot; others
      interpret this word as meaning &quot;short-swordsmen,&quot;
      or &quot;daring ones&quot;, the name of a class of men who
      were defenders of the towers of Tyre.</a>

      of the priestly courses (1 Chr. 24:17).</a>

       <a name="T0001428"><b>Gap -</b> a rent or opening in a
      wall (Ezek. 13:5; comp. Amos 4:3). The false prophets did
      not stand in the gap (Ezek. 22: 30), i.e., they did nothing
      to stop the outbreak of wickedness.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001429"><b>Gardens -</b> mentioned in
      Scripture, of Eden (Gen. 2:8, 9); Ahab&#39;s garden of
      herbs (1 Kings 21:2); the royal garden (2 Kings 21:18); the
      royal garden at Susa (Esther 1:5); the garden of Joseph of
      Arimathea (John 19:41); of Gethsemane (John 18:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The &quot;king&#39;s garden&quot; mentioned 2 Kings 25:4,
      Neh. 3:15, was near the Pool of Siloam.
    </p>
    <p>
       Gardens were surrounded by hedges of thorns (Isa. 5:5) or
      by walls of stone (Prov. 24:31). &quot;Watch-towers&quot;
      or &quot;lodges&quot; were also built in them (Isa. 1:8;
      Mark 12:1), in which their keepers sat. On account of their
      retirement they were frequently used as places for secret
      prayer and communion with God (Gen. 24:63; Matt. 26:30-36;
      John 1:48; 18:1, 2). The dead were sometimes buried in
      gardens (Gen. 23:19, 20; 2 Kings 21:18, 26; 1 Sam. 25:1;
      Mark 15:46; John 19:41). (See <a href=

      of lepers, and consequently a place outside the boundary of
      the city.

      strong odour), mentioned only once (Num. 11:5). The garlic
      common in Eastern countries is the Allium sativum or Allium
      Ascalonicum, so called from its having been brought into
      Europe from Ascalon by the Crusaders. It is now known by
      the name of &quot;shallot&quot; or
      &quot;eschalot.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001433"><b>Garner -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;otsar, a
      treasure; a store of goods laid up, and hence also the
      place where they are deposited (Joel 1:17; 2 Chr. 32:27,
      rendered &quot;treasury&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. mezev, a cell, storeroom (Ps. 144:13); Gr.
      apotheke, a place for storing anything, a granary (Matt.

    </p>

       In Job 26:13 (Heb. shiphrah, meaning

      etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. netsib, a prefect, superintendent; hence a
      military post (1 Sam. 10:5; 13:3, 4; 2 Sam. 8:6). This word
      has also been explained to denote a pillar set up to mark
      the Philistine conquest, or an officer appointed to collect
      taxes; but the idea of a military post seems to be the
      correct one.
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Heb. matstsebah, properly a monumental column;
      improperly rendered pl. &quot;garrisons&quot; in Ezek.
      26:11; correctly in Revised Version &quot;pillars,&quot;
      marg. &quot;obelisks,&quot; probably an idolatrous image.

      Jerusalem (Jer. 37:13; Neh. 1:3; 2:3; 3:3), of Sodom (Gen.
      19:1), of Gaza (Judg. 16:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Of royal palaces (Neh. 2:8).
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Of the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 6:34, 35; 2 Kings
      18:16); of the holy place (1 Kings 6:31, 32; Ezek. 41:23,
      24); of the outer courts of the temple, the beautiful gate
      (Acts 3:2).
    </p>
    <p>
       (4.) Tombs (Matt. 27:60).
    </p>
    <p>
       (5.) Prisons (Acts 12:10; 16:27).
    </p>
    <p>
       (6.) Caverns (1 Kings 19:13).
    </p>
    <p>
       (7.) Camps (Ex. 32:26, 27; Heb. 13:12).
    </p>
    <p>
       The materials of which gates were made were,
    </p>
    <p>
       (1.) Iron and brass (Ps. 107:16; Isa. 45:2; Acts 12:10).
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Stones and pearls (Isa. 54:12; Rev. 21:21).
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Wood (Judg. 16:3) probably.
    </p>
    <p>
       At the gates of cities courts of justice were frequently
      held, and hence &quot;judges of the gate&quot; are spoken
      of (Deut. 16:18; 17:8; 21:19; 25:6, 7, etc.). At the gates
      prophets also frequently delivered their messages (Prov.
      1:21; 8:3; Isa. 29:21; Jer. 17:19, 20; 26:10). Criminals
      were punished without the gates (1 Kings 21:13; Acts 7:59).
      By the &quot;gates of righteousness&quot; we are probably
      to understand those of the temple (Ps. 118:19). &quot;The
      gates of hell&quot; (R.V., &quot;gates of Hades&quot;)
      Matt. 16:18, are generally interpreted as meaning the power
      of Satan, but probably they may mean the power of death,
      denoting that the Church of Christ shall never die.

      famous also as being the birthplace or residence of Goliath
      (1 Sam. 17:4). David fled from Saul to Achish, king of Gath
      (1 Sam. 21:10; 27:2-4; Ps. 56), and his connection with it
      will account for the words in 2 Sam. 1:20. It was
      afterwards conquered by David (2 Sam. 8:1). It occupied a
      strong position on the borders of Judah and Philistia (1
      Sam. 21:10; 1 Chr. 18:1). Its site has been identified with
      the hill called Tell esSafieh, the Alba Specula of the

      This was one of the provinces ruled by Herod Antipas. It

      strong, a city on the Mediterranean shore, remarkable for
      its early importance as the chief centre of a great
      commercial traffic with Egypt. It is one of the oldest
      cities of the world (Gen. 10:19; Josh. 15:47). Its earliest
      inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and
      displaced by the Caphtorims (Deut. 2:23; Josh. 13:2, 3), a
      Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to
      the lot of Judah (Josh. 15:47; Judg. 1:18). It was the
      southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave
      each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord
      (1 Sam. 6:17). Its gates were carried away by Samson (Judg.
      16:1-3). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and &quot;did
      grind in the prison house.&quot; Here he also pulled down
      the temple of Dagon, and slew &quot;all the lords of the
      Philistines,&quot; himself also perishing in the ruin
      (Judg. 16:21-30). The prophets denounce the judgments of
      God against it (Jer. 25:20; 47:5; Amos 1:6, 7; Zeph. 2:4).
      It is referred to in Acts 8:26. Philip is here told to take
      the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west
      of Jerusalem), &quot;which is desert&quot;, i.e., the
      &quot;desert road,&quot; probably by Hebron, through the
      desert hills of Southern Judea. (See <a href=

      with him&quot; (Jer. 41:2, 3) at Mizpah about three months
      after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his band also
      plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many

      He appears in connection with the history of the Shunammite
      (2 Kings 4:14, 31) and of Naaman the Syrian. On this latter
      occasion he was guilty of duplicity and dishonesty of
      conduct, causing Elisha to denounce his crime with

      in sacrifice to Molech (2 Chr. 28:3; 33:6; Jer. 7:31;

      receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead
      bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth,
      were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning. It thus
      in process of time became the image of the place of

      chamber, and again in the hearing of Gemariah and other
      scribes, the prophecies of Jeremiah (Jer. 36:11-20), which
      filled him with terror. He joined with others in entreating
      the king not to destroy the roll of the prophecies which
      Baruch had read (21-25).</a>

       (2.) The son of Hilkiah, who accompanied Shaphan with the

      generations,&quot; means a family register, or history of
      Adam. 37:2, &quot;The generations of Jacob&quot; = the
      history of Jacob and his descendants. 7:1, &quot;In this
      generation&quot; = in this age. Ps. 49:19, &quot;The
      generation of his fathers&quot; = the dwelling of his
      fathers, i.e., the grave. Ps. 73:15, &quot;The generation
      of thy children&quot; = the contemporary race. Isa. 53:8,
      &quot;Who shall declare his generation?&quot; = His manner

      shall be so numerous that no one shall be able to declare
      it.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       In Matt. 1:17, the word means a succession or series of
      persons from the same stock. Matt. 3:7, &quot;Generation of
      vipers&quot; = brood of vipers. 24:34, &quot;This
      generation&quot; = the persons then living contemporary
      with Christ. 1 Pet. 2:9, &quot;A chosen generation&quot; =
      a chosen people.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Hebrews seem to have reckoned time by the generation.
      In the time of Abraham a generation was an hundred years,
      thus: Gen. 15:16, &quot;In the fourth generation&quot; = in
      four hundred years (comp. verse 13 and Ex. 12:40). In Deut.
      1:35 and 2:14 a generation is a period of thirty-eight
      years.

       <a name="T0001457"><b>Genesis -</b> The five books of
      Moses were collectively called the Pentateuch, a word of
      Greek origin meaning &quot;the five-fold book.&quot; The
      Jews called them the Torah, i.e., &quot;the law.&quot; It
      is probable that the division of the Torah into five books
      proceeded from the Greek translators of the Old Testament.
      The names by which these several books are generally known
      are Greek.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The first book of the Pentateuch (q.v.) is called by the
      Jews Bereshith, i.e., &quot;in the beginning&quot;, because
      this is the first word of the book. It is generally known
      among Christians by the name of Genesis, i.e.,
      &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;generation,&quot; being the
      name given to it in the LXX. as designating its character,
      because it gives an account of the origin of all things. It
      contains, according to the usual computation, the history
      of about two thousand three hundred and sixty-nine years.
    </p>
    <p>
       Genesis is divided into two principal parts. The first
      part (1-11) gives a general history of mankind down to the
      time of the Dispersion. The second part presents the early
      history of Israel down to the death and burial of Joseph
      (12-50).
    </p>
    <p>
       There are five principal persons brought in succession
      under our notice in this book, and around these persons the
      history of the successive periods is grouped, viz., Adam
      (1-3), Noah (4-9), Abraham (10-25:18), Isaac (25:19-35:29),
      and Jacob (36-50).

    <p>
       In this book we have several prophecies concerning Christ
      (3:15; 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; 49:10). The author
      of this book was Moses. Under divine guidance he may indeed
      have been led to make use of materials already existing in
      primeval documents, or even of traditions in a trustworthy
      form that had come down to his time, purifying them from
      all that was unworthy; but the hand of Moses is clearly
      seen throughout in its composition.

      Isaac was born in this place. Both of these patriarchs were
      guilty of the sin of here denying their wives, and both of
      them entered into a treaty with the king before they
      departed to Beersheba (21:23-34; 26). It seems to have been
      a rich pastoral country (2 Chr. 14:12-18). Isaac here

      Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being distant
      from each other about 2 miles (Deut. 27; Josh. 8:30-35). On
      the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the
      handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of
      Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to
      the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when
      Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the
      hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal
      responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses

      a priesthood, as rivals to those of the Jews at Jerusalem.
      This temple was destroyed after it had stood two hundred
      years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great. There
      is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the
      incident recorded in Gen. 22. There are many ruins on this
      mountain, some of which are evidently of Christian
      buildings. To this mountain the woman of Sychar referred in
      John 4:20. For centuries Gerizim was the centre of
      political outbreaks. The Samaritans (q.v.), a small but
      united body, still linger here, and keep up their ancient
      ceremonial worship.

      attacked by a sudden and dangerous illness (4:24-26), which
      Zipporah his wife believed to have been sent because he had
      neglected to circumcise his son. She accordingly took a

      disciples, and which is specially memorable as being the
      scene of his agony (Mark 14:32; John 18:1; Luke 22:44). The

      of Gethsemane is still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land
      and the Book) says: &quot;When I first came to Jerusalem,
      and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open
      to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its
      very old olivetrees. The Latins, however, have within the
      last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and
      have built a high wall around it...The Greeks have invented
      another site a little to the north of it...My own
      impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near
      the city, and so close to what must have always been the
      great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely
      have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and
      dismal night...I am inclined to place the garden in the
      secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of

      1 Chr. 6:67). It stood between the lower Beth-horon and the
      sea (Josh. 16:3; 1 Kings 9:17). It was the last point to
      which David pursued the Philistines (2 Sam. 5:25; 1 Chr.

      (Gen. 6:4). These were the violent tyrants of those days,
      those who fell upon others. The word may also be derived
      from a root signifying &quot;wonder,&quot; and hence
      &quot;monsters&quot; or &quot;prodigies.&quot; In Num.
      13:33 this name is given to a Canaanitish tribe, a race of

      on the east of Jordan, from whom Og was descended. They
      were probably the original inhabitants of the land before
      the immigration of the Canaanites. They were conquered by
      Chedorlaomer (Gen. 14:5), and their territories were

      Hebron (Gen. 23:2; Josh. 15:13). They were a Cushite tribe
      of the same race as the Philistines and the Egyptian

      rendered &quot;mighty men&quot; (2 Sam. 23:8-39; 1 Kings
      1:8; 1 Chr. 11:9-47; 29:24.) The band of six hundred whom
      David gathered around him when he was a fugitive were so

      while besieging it, was slain under its walls by Baasha,
      one of his own officers (1 Kings 15:27). It was in the

      &quot;of Benjamin&quot; (1 Sam. 13:15), better known as
      &quot;Gibeah of Saul&quot; (11:4; Isa. 10:29). It was here
      that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite&#39;s
      concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the
      tribe of Benjamin (Judg. 19; 20), only six hundred men
      surviving after a succession of disastrous battles. This
      was the birthplace of Saul, and continued to be his
      residence after he became king (1 Sam. 10:26; 11:4; 15:34).
      It was reckoned among the ancient sanctuaries of Palestine
      (10:26; 15:34; 23:19; 26:1; 2 Sam. 21:6-10), and hence it
      is called &quot;Gibeah of God&quot; (1 Sam. 10:5, R.V.
      marg.). It has been identified with the modern Tell el-Ful
      (i.e., &quot;hill of the bean&quot;), about 3 miles north

      the royal cities, greater than Ai, and all the men thereof
      were mighty&quot; (Josh. 10:2). Its inhabitants were
      Hivites (11:19). It lay within the territory of Benjamin,
      and became a priest-city (18:25; 21:17). Here the
      tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and
      here it remained many years till the temple was built by
      Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the
      south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of
      Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from
      three other cities (Josh. 9;17), visited the camp at
      Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to
      enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had
      been specially warned against any league with the
      inhabitants of Canaan (Ex. 23:32; 34:12; Num. 33:55; Deut.
      7:2). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three
      days later; but the oath rashly sworn &quot;by Jehovah God
      of Israel&quot; was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites
      were spared. They were, however, made &quot;bondmen&quot;
      to the sanctuary (Josh. 9:23).
    </p>
    <p>
       The most remarkable incident connected with this city was
      the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine
      (Josh. 10:16-27). The battle here fought has been regarded
      as &quot;one of the most important in the history of the
      world.&quot; The kings of southern Canaan entered into a
      confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a
      league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec,
      king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of
      taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to
      come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came
      suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped
      before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken
      remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced
      cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were
      taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This
      eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the
      cities of Southern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a
      letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt,
      written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that
      the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
       This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a
      battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that
      of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare
      the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen
      to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of
      the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The
      two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his
      host were routed and put to flight (2 Sam. 2:12-17). This
      battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel,
      Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under
      Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.
    </p>
    <p>
       Soon after the death of Absalom and David&#39;s
      restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a
      grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for
      Saul&#39;s violation (2 Sam. 21:2, 5) of the covenant with
      the Gibeonites (Josh. 9:3-27). The Gibeonites demanded
      blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and
      accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah
      (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the
      Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified &quot;in the hill
      before the Lord&quot; (2 Sam. 21:9); and there the bodies
      hung for six months (21:10), and all the while Rizpah
      watched over the blackening corpses and &quot;suffered
      neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor
      the beasts of the field by night.&quot; David afterwards
      removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead
      (21:12, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
       Here, &quot;at the great stone,&quot; Amasa was put to
      death by Joab (2 Sam. 20:5-10). To the altar of
      burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab (1 Kings 2:28-34),
      who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in
      the beginning of Solomon&#39;s reign, and was there also
      slain by the hand of Benaiah.
    </p>
    <p>
       Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of
      state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices (1 Kings 3:4; 2
      Chr. 1:3). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a
      memorable dream, recorded in 1 Kings 3:5-15; 2 Chr. 1:7-12.
      When the temple was built &quot;all the men of Israel
      assembled themselves&quot; to king Solomon, and brought up
      from Gibeon the tabernacle and &quot;all the holy vessels
      that were in the tabernacle&quot; to Jerusalem, where they
      remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar (2
      Kings 24:13).

       <a name="T0001481"><b>Gideon -</b> called also Jerubbaal
      (Judg. 6:29, 32), was the first of the judges whose history
      is circumstantially narrated (Judg. 6-8). His calling is
      the commencement of the second period in the history of the
      judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over
      Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the
      Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other &quot;children
      of the east,&quot; crossed the Jordan each year for seven
      successive years for the purpose of plundering and
      desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God
      to undertake the task of delivering the land from these
      warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer (Josh.
      17:2; 1 Chr. 7:18), and of the little township of Ophrah
      (Judg. 6:11). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew
      the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon
      it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people
      flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the
      number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however,
      reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with
      torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three
      different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the
      valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry,
      &quot;For the Lord and for Gideon&quot; (Judg. 7:18, R.V.).
      Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire
      confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that
      only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred
      and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great
      deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the
      nation (1 Sam. 12:11; Ps. 83:11; Isa. 9:4; 10:26; Heb.
      11:32). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died
      in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his
      fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the
      people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the
      worship of Baalim, &quot;neither shewed they kindness to
      the house of Jerubbaal&quot; (Judg. 8:35). Gideon left
      behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race,
      with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have
      had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of
      restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him
      a band who slaughtered all Gideon&#39;s sons, except
      Jotham, upon one stone. (See <a href=

      R.V., &quot;vulture&quot;), a species of vulture living
      entirely on carrion. &quot;It is about the size of a raven;
      has an almost triangular, bald, and wrinkled head, a strong
      pointed beak, black at the tip, large eyes and ears, the
      latter entirely on the outside, and long feet.&quot; It is
      common in Egypt, where it is popularly called
      &quot;Pharaoh&#39;s chicken&quot; (the Neophron
      percnopterus), and is found in Palestine only during
      summer. Tristram thinks that the Hebrew name, which is
      derived from a root meaning &quot;to love,&quot; is given
      to it from the fact that the male and female bird never
      part company.</a>

       The giving of presents entered largely into the affairs of
      common life in the East. The nature of the presents was as
      various as were the occasions: food (1 Sam. 9:7; 16:20),
      sheep and cattle (Gen. 32:13-15), gold (2 Sam. 18:11),
      jewels (Gen. 24:53), furniture, and vessels for eating and
      drinking (2 Sam. 17:28); delicacies, as spices, honey, etc.
      (1 Kings 10:25; 2 Kings 5: 22). The mode of presentation
      was with as much parade as possible: the presents were
      conveyed by the hands of servants (Judg. 3:18), or still
      better, on the backs of beasts of burden (2 Kings 8:9). The
      refusal of a present was regarded as a high indignity; and
      this constituted the aggravated insult noticed in Matt.
      22:11, the marriage robe having been offered and refused.

       <a name="T0001484"><b>Gifts, spiritual -</b> (Gr.
      charismata), gifts supernaturally bestowed on the early
      Christians, each having his own proper gift or gifts for
      the edification of the body of Christ. These were the
      result of the extraordinary operation of the Spirit, as on
      the day of Pentecost. They were the gifts of speaking with
      tongues, casting out devils, healing, etc. (Mark 16:17,
      18), usually communicated by the medium of the laying on of
      the hands of the apostles (Acts 8:17; 19:6; 1 Tim. 4:14).
      These charismata were enjoyed only for a time. They could
      not continue always in the Church. They were suited to its
      infancy and to the necessities of those times.</a>

       <a name="T0001485"><b>Gihon -</b> a stream. (1.) One of
      the four rivers of Eden (Gen. 2:13). It has been identified
      with the Nile. Others regard it as the Oxus, or the Araxes,
      or the Ganges. But as, according to the sacred narrative,
      all these rivers of Eden took their origin from the
      head-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it is
      probable that the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under
      the modern name of the Arras, discharges itself into the
      Caspian Sea. It was the Asiatic and not the African
      &quot;Cush&quot; which the Gihon compassed (Gen. 10:7-10).

       (2.) The only natural spring of water in or near Jerusalem
      is the &quot;Fountain of the Virgin&quot; (q.v.), which
      rises outside the city walls on the west bank of the Kidron
      valley. On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian
      army under Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the
      besiegers from finding water, &quot;stopped the upper water
      course of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west
      side of the city of David&quot; (2 Chr. 32:30; 33:14). This
      &quot;fountain&quot; or spring is therefore to be regarded
      as the &quot;upper water course of Gihon.&quot; From this
      &quot;fountain&quot; a tunnel cut through the ridge which
      forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water
      to the Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of
      this ridge at the head of the Tyropoeon
      (&quot;cheesemakers&#39;&quot;) valley, or valley of the
      son of Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this
      tunnel is about 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was
      accidentally discovered on the wall of the tunnel about
      nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool of Siloam.
      This inscription was executed in all probability by
      Hezekiah&#39;s workmen. It briefly narrates the history of
      the excavation. It may, however, be possible that this
      tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon. If the
      &quot;waters of Shiloah that go softly&quot; (Isa. 8:6)
      refers to the gentle stream that still flows through the
      tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation must
      have existed before the time of Hezekiah.

    <p>
       In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two
      pools still existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla,
      to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of
      the first, called Birket es-Sultan. It is the opinion of
      some that the former was the &quot;upper&quot; and the
      latter the &quot;lower&quot; Pool of Gihon (2 Kings 18:17;
      Isa. 7:3; 36:2; 22:9). (See CONDUIT &macr;T0000877; <a

       <a name="T0001486"><b>Gilboa -</b> boiling spring, a
      mountain range, now Jebel Fukua&#39;, memorable as the
      scene of Saul&#39;s disastrous defeat by the Philistines.
      Here also his three sons were slain, and he himself died by
      his own hand (1 Sam. 28:4; 31:1-8; 2 Sam. 1:6-21; 21:12; 1
      Chr. 10:1, 8). It was a low barren range of mountains
      bounding the valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel) on the east,
      between it and the Jordan valley. When the tidings of this
      defeat were conveyed to David, he gave utterance to those
      pathetic words in the &quot;Song of the Bow&quot; (2 Sam.
      1:19-27).</a>

       <a name="T0001487"><b>Gilead -</b> hill of testimony,
      (Gen. 31:21), a mountainous region east of Jordan. From its
      mountainous character it is called &quot;the mount of
      Gilead&quot; (Gen. 31:25). It is called also &quot;the land
      of Gilead&quot; (Num. 32:1), and sometimes simply
      &quot;Gilead&quot; (Ps. 60:7; Gen. 37:25). It comprised the
      possessions of the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the south
      part of Manasseh (Deut. 3:13; Num. 32:40). It was bounded
      on the north by Bashan, and on the south by Moab and Ammon
      (Gen. 31:21; Deut. 3:12-17). &quot;Half Gilead&quot; was
      possessed by Sihon, and the other half, separated from it
      by the river Jabbok, by Og, king of Bashan. The deep ravine
      of the river Hieromax (the modern Sheriat el-Mandhur)
      separated Bashan from Gilead, which was about 60 miles in
      length and 20 in breadth, extending from near the south end
      of the Lake of Gennesaret to the north end of the Dead Sea.
      Abarim, Pisgah, Nebo, and Peor are its mountains mentioned
      in Scripture.</a>

       <a name="T0001488"><b>Gilead, Balm of -</b> The region of
      Gilead abounded in spices and aromatic gums, which were
      exported to Egypt and Tyre (Gen. 37:25; Jer. 8:22; 46:11;
      Ezek. 27:17). The word &quot;balm&quot; is a contracted
      form of &quot;balsam,&quot; a word derived from the Greek
      <i>balsamon</i>, which was adopted as the representative of
      the Hebrew words <i>baal shemen</i>, meaning
      &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;chief of oils.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The Hebrew name of this balm was <i>tsori</i>. The tree
      yielding this medicinal oil was probably the Balsamodendron
      opobalsamum of botanists, and the Amyris opobalsamum of
      Linnaeus. It is an evergreen, rising to the height of about
      14 feet. The oil or resin, exuding through an orifice made
      in its bark in very small quantities, is esteemed of great
      value for its supposed medicinal qualities. (See <a href=

       BALM</a>.) It may be noted that Coverdale&#39;s version
      reads in Jer. 8:22, &quot;There is no triacle in

      &quot;treacle&quot; is used in the sense of ointment.

      solemn transaction of the reading of the law in the valley
      of Shechem between Ebal and Gerizim the Israelites moved
      forward to Gilgal, and there made a permanent camp (Josh.
      9:6; 10:6). It was &quot;beside the oaks of Moreh,&quot;
      near which Abraham erected his first altar (Gen. 12:6, 7).
      This was one of the three towns to which Samuel resorted
      for the administration of justice (1 Sam. 7:16), and here
      also he offered sacrifices when the ark was no longer in
      the tabernacle at Shiloh (1 Sam. 10:8; 13:7-9). To this
      place, as to a central sanctuary, all Israel gathered to
      renew their allegiance to Saul (11:14). At a later period
      it became the scene of idolatrous worship (Hos. 4:15;
      9:15). It has been identified with the ruins of Jiljilieh,
      about 5 miles south-west of Shiloh and about the same
      distance from Bethel.</a>

    <p>
       (2.) The place in &quot;the plains of Jericho,&quot;
      &quot;in the east border of Jericho,&quot; where the
      Israelites first encamped after crossing the Jordan (Josh.
      4:19, 20). Here they kept their first Passover in the land
      of Canaan (5:10) and renewed the rite of circumcision, and
      so &quot;rolled away the reproach&quot; of their Egyptian
      slavery. Here the twelve memorial stones, taken from the
      bed of the Jordan, were set up; and here also the
      tabernacle remained till it was removed to Shiloh (18:1).
      It has been identified with Tell Jiljulieh, about 5 miles
      from Jordan.

    <p>
       (3.) A place, probably in the hill country of Ephraim,
      where there was a school of the prophets (2 Kings 4:38),
      and whence Elijah and Elisha, who resided here, &quot;went
      down&quot; to Bethel (2:1,2). It is mentioned also in Deut.

    </p>
    <p>

      prophets (2 Kings 1:8; Jer. 13:1), soldiers (Isa. 5:27; 2
      Sam. 20:8; Ezek. 23:15), Kings (Job 12:18).

      to the ephod, and was made of the same material.
    </p>
    <p>
       The common girdle was made of leather (2 Kings 1:8; Matt.
      3:4); a finer sort of linen (Jer. 13:1; Ezek. 16:10; Dan.
      10:5). Girdles of sackcloth were worn in token of sorrow
      (Isa. 3:24; 22:12). They were variously fastened to the
      wearer (Mark 1:6; Jer. 13:1; Ezek. 16:10).
    </p>
    <p>
       The girdle was a symbol of strength and power (Job 12:18,
      21; 30:11; Isa. 22:21; 45:5). &quot;Righteousness and
      faithfulness&quot; are the girdle of the Messiah (Isa.
      11:5).
    </p>
    <p>
       Girdles were used as purses or pockets (Matt. 10:9. A. V.,
      &quot;purses;&quot; R.V., marg., &quot;girdles.&quot; Also
