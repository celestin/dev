       <a name="T0001500"><b>Glass -</b> was known to the
      Egyptians at a very early period of their national history,
      at least B.C. 1500. Various articles both useful and
      ornamental were made of it, as bottles, vases, etc. A glass
      bottle with the name of Sargon on it was found among the
      ruins of the north-west palace of Nimroud. The Hebrew word
      <i>zekukith</i> (Job 28:17), rendered in the Authorized
      Version &quot;crystal,&quot; is rightly rendered in the
      Revised Version &quot;glass.&quot; This is the only
      allusion to glass found in the Old Testament. It is
      referred to in the New Testament in Rev. 4:6; 15:2; 21:18,
      21. In Job 37:18, the word rendered
      &quot;looking-glass&quot; is in the Revised Version
      properly rendered &quot;mirror,&quot; formed, i.e., of some
      metal. (Comp. Ex. 38:8: &quot;looking-glasses&quot; are
      brazen mirrors, R.V.). A mirror is referred to also in
      James 1:23.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001501"><b>Glean -</b> The corners of fields
      were not to be reaped, and the sheaf accidentally left
      behind was not to be fetched away, according to the law of
      Moses (Lev. 19:9; 23:22; Deut. 24:21). They were to be left
      for the poor to glean. Similar laws were given regarding
      vineyards and oliveyards. (Comp. Ruth 2:2.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001502"><b>Glede -</b> an Old English name for
      the common kite, mentioned only in Deut. 14:13 (Heb.
      ra&#39;ah), the Milvus ater or black kite. The Hebrew word
      does not occur in the parallel passage in Leviticus (11:14,
      da&#39;ah, rendered &quot;vulture;&quot; in R.V.,
      &quot;kite&quot;). It was an unclean bird. The Hebrew name
      is from a root meaning &quot;to see,&quot; &quot;to
      look,&quot; thus designating a bird with a keen sight. The
      bird intended is probably the buzzard, of which there are
      three species found in Palestine. (See <a href=

       VULTURE</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001503"><b>Glorify -</b> (1.) To make glorious,
      or cause so to appear (John 12:28; 13:31, 32; 17:4,5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Spoken of God to &quot;shew forth his praise&quot; (1
      Cor. 6:20; 10:31).
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001504"><b>Glory -</b> (Heb. kabhod; Gr. doxa).
      (1.) Abundance, wealth, treasure, and hence honour (Ps.
      49:12); glory (Gen. 31:1; Matt. 4:8; Rev. 21:24, 26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Honour, dignity (1 Kings 3:13; Heb. 2:7 1 Pet. 1:24);
      of God (Ps. 19:1; 29:1); of the mind or heart (Gen. 49:6;
      Ps. 7:5; Acts 2:46).
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Splendour, brightness, majesty (Gen. 45:13; Isa. 4:5;
      Acts 22:11; 2 Cor. 3:7); of Jehovah (Isa. 59:19; 60:1; 2
      Thess. 1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
       (4.) The glorious moral attributes, the infinite
      perfections of God (Isa. 40:5; Acts 7:2; Rom. 1:23; 9:23;
      Eph. 1:12). Jesus is the &quot;brightness of the
      Father&#39;s glory&quot; (Heb. 1:3; John 1:14; 2:11).
    </p>
    <p>
       (5.) The bliss of heaven (Rom. 2:7, 10; 5:2; 8:18; Heb.
      2:10; 1 Pet. 5:1, 10).
    </p>
    <p>
       (6.) The phrase &quot;Give glory to God&quot; (Josh. 7:19;
      Jer. 13:16) is a Hebrew idiom meaning, &quot;Confess your
      sins.&quot; The words of the Jews to the blind man,
      &quot;Give God the praise&quot; (John 9:24), are an
      adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to,
      &quot;Confess that you are an impostor,&quot; &quot;Give
      God the glory by speaking the truth;&quot; for they denied
      that a miracle had been wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001505"><b>Glutton -</b> (Deut. 21:20), Heb.
      zolel, from a word meaning &quot;to shake out,&quot;
      &quot;to squander;&quot; and hence one who is prodigal, who
      wastes his means by indulgence. In Prov. 23:21, the word
      means debauchees or wasters of their own body. In Prov.
      28:7, the word (pl.) is rendered Authorized Version
      &quot;riotous men;&quot; Revised Version,
      &quot;gluttonous.&quot; Matt. 11:19, Luke 7:34, Greek
      phagos, given to eating, gluttonous.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001506"><b>Gnash -</b> Heb. harak, meaning
      &quot;to grate the teeth&quot;, (Job 16:9; Ps. 112:10; Lam.
      2:16), denotes rage or sorrow. (See also Acts 7:54; Mark
      9:18.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001507"><b>Gnat -</b> only in Matt. 23:24, a
      small two-winged stinging fly of the genus Culex, which
      includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to the gnat in a
      proverbial expression probably in common use, &quot;who
      strain out the gnat;&quot; the words in the Authorized
      Version, &quot;strain at a gnat,&quot; being a mere
      typographical error, which has been corrected in the
      Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this
      purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded on Lev.
      11:23. It is supposed that the &quot;lice,&quot; Ex. 8:16
      (marg. R.V., &quot;sand-flies&quot;), were a species of
      gnat.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001508"><b>Goad -</b> (Heb. malmad, only in
      Judg. 3: 31), an instrument used by ploughmen for guiding
      their oxen. Shamgar slew six hundred Philistines with an
      ox-goad. &quot;The goad is a formidable weapon. It is
      sometimes ten feet long, and has a sharp point. We could
      now see that the feat of Shamgar was not so very wonderful
      as some have been accustomed to think.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       In 1 Sam. 13:21, a different Hebrew word is used, <i>
      dorban</i>, meaning something pointed. The expression (Acts
      9:5, omitted in the R.V.), &quot;It is hard for thee to
      kick against the pricks&quot;, i.e., against the goad, was
      proverbial for unavailing resistance to superior power.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001509"><b>Goat -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;ez, the
      she-goat (Gen. 15:9; 30:35; 31:38). This Hebrew word is
      also used for the he-goat (Ex. 12:5; Lev. 4:23; Num.
      28:15), and to denote a kid (Gen. 38:17, 20). Hence it may
      be regarded as the generic name of the animal as
      domesticated. It literally means &quot;strength,&quot; and
      points to the superior strength of the goat as compared
      with the sheep.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. &#39;attud, only in plural; rendered
      &quot;rams&quot; (Gen. 31:10,12); he-goats (Num. 7:17-88;
      Isa. 1:11); goats (Deut. 32:14; Ps. 50:13). They were used
      in sacrifice (Ps. 66:15). This word is used metaphorically
      for princes or chiefs in Isa. 14:9, and in Zech. 10:3 as
      leaders. (Comp. Jer. 50:8.)
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Heb. gedi, properly a kid. Its flesh was a delicacy
      among the Hebrews (Gen. 27:9, 14, 17; Judg. 6:19).
    </p>
    <p>
       (4.) Heb. sa&#39;ir, meaning the &quot;shaggy,&quot; a
      hairy goat, a he-goat (2 Chr. 29:23); &quot;a goat&quot;
      (Lev. 4:24); &quot;satyr&quot; (Isa. 13:21);
      &quot;devils&quot; (Lev. 17:7). It is the goat of the
      sin-offering (Lev. 9:3, 15; 10:16).
    </p>
    <p>
       (5.) Heb. tsaphir, a he-goat of the goats (2 Chr. 29:21).
      In Dan. 8:5, 8 it is used as a symbol of the Macedonian
      empire.
    </p>
    <p>
       (6.) Heb. tayish, a &quot;striker&quot; or
      &quot;butter,&quot; rendered &quot;he-goat&quot; (Gen.
      30:35; 32:14).
    </p>
    <p>
       (7.) Heb. &#39;azazel (q.v.), the &quot;scapegoat&quot;
      (Lev. 16:8, 10,26).
    </p>
    <p>
       (8.) There are two Hebrew words used to denote the
      undomesticated goat:, <i>Yael</i>, only in plural mountain
      goats (1 Sam. 24:2; Job 39:1; Ps.104:18). It is derived
      from a word meaning &quot;to climb.&quot; It is the ibex,
      which abounded in the mountainous parts of Moab. And <i>
      &#39;akko</i>, only in Deut. 14:5, the wild goat.
    </p>
    <p>
       Goats are mentioned in the New Testament in Matt.
      25:32,33; Heb. 9:12,13, 19; 10:4. They represent oppressors
      and wicked men (Ezek. 34:17; 39:18; Matt. 25:33).
    </p>
    <p>
       Several varieties of the goat were familiar to the
      Hebrews. They had an important place in their rural economy
      on account of the milk they afforded and the excellency of
      the flesh of the kid. They formed an important part of
      pastoral wealth (Gen. 31:10, 12;32:14; 1 Sam. 25:2).
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001510"><b>Goath -</b> a lowing, a place near
      Jerusalem, mentioned only in Jer. 31:39.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001511"><b>Gob -</b> a pit, a place mentioned
      in 2 Sam. 21:18, 19; called also Gezer, in 1 Chr. 20:4.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001512"><b>Goblet -</b> a laver or trough for
      washing garments. In Cant. 7:2, a bowl or drinking vessel,
      a bowl for mixing wine; in Ex. 24:6, a sacrificial basin.
      (See <a href=

    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001513"><b>God -</b> (A.S. and Dutch God; Dan.
      Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the
      rendering (1) of the Hebrew <i>&#39;El</i>, from a word
      meaning to be strong; (2) of <i>&#39;Eloah_, plural
      _&#39;Elohim</i>. The singular form, <i>Eloah</i>, is used
      only in poetry. The plural form is more commonly used in
      all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the
      only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme
      Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by
      &quot;LORD,&quot; printed in small capitals. The existence
      of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere
      any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is
      spoken of as one devoid of understanding (Ps. 14:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The arguments generally adduced by theologians in proof of
      the being of God are:
    </p>
    <p>
       (1.) The a priori argument, which is the testimony
      afforded by reason.
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) The a posteriori argument, by which we proceed
      logically from the facts of experience to causes. These
      arguments are,
    </p>
    <p>
       (a) The cosmological, by which it is proved that there
      must be a First Cause of all things, for every effect must
      have a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
       (b) The teleological, or the argument from design. We see
      everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
       (c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological
      argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history
      of mankind, which exhibits a moral order and purpose which
      can only be explained on the supposition of the existence
      of God. Conscience and human history testify that
      &quot;verily there is a God that judgeth in the
      earth.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       The attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in
      Ex. 34:6,7. (see also Deut. 6:4; 10:17; Num. 16:22; Ex.
      15:11; 33:19; Isa. 44:6; Hab. 3:6; Ps. 102:26; Job 34:12.)
      They are also systematically classified in Rev. 5:12 and
      7:12.
    </p>
    <p>
       God&#39;s attributes are spoken of by some as absolute,
      i.e., such as belong to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.;
      and relative, i.e., such as are ascribed to him with
      relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them into
      communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree
      to his creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and
      incommunicable, which cannot be so imparted: independence,
      immutability, immensity, and eternity. They are by some
      also divided into natural attributes, eternity, immensity,
      etc.; and moral, holiness, goodness, etc.

    <p>
       <a name="T0001514"><b>Godhead -</b> (Acts 17:29; Rom.
      1:20; Col. 2:9), the essential being or the nature of
      God.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001515"><b>Godliness -</b> the whole of
      practical piety (1 Tim. 4:8; 2 Pet. 1:6). &quot;It supposes
      knowledge, veneration, affection, dependence, submission,
      gratitude, and obedience.&quot; In 1 Tim. 3:16 it denotes
      the substance of revealed religion.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001516"><b>Goel -</b> in Hebrew the participle
      of the verb <i>gaal</i>, &quot;to redeem.&quot; It is
      rendered in the Authorized Version &quot;kinsman,&quot;
      Num. 5:8; Ruth 3:12; 4:1,6,8; &quot;redeemer,&quot; Job
      19:25; &quot;avenger,&quot; Num. 35:12; Deut. 19:6, etc.
      The Jewish law gave the right of redeeming and
      repurchasing, as well as of avenging blood, to the next
      relative, who was accordingly called by this name. (See <a

       <a name="T0001517"><b>Gog -</b> (1.) A Reubenite (1 Chr.
      5:4), the father of Shimei.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) The name of the leader of the hostile party described
      in Ezek. 38,39, as coming from the &quot;north
      country&quot; and assailing the people of Israel to their
      own destruction. This prophecy has been regarded as
      fulfilled in the conflicts of the Maccabees with Antiochus,
      the invasion and overthrow of the Chaldeans, and the
      temporary successes and destined overthrow of the Turks.
      But &quot;all these interpretations are unsatisfactory and
      inadequate. The vision respecting Gog and Magog in the
      Apocalypse (Rev. 20:8) is in substance a reannouncement of
      this prophecy of Ezekiel. But while Ezekiel contemplates
      the great conflict in a more general light as what was
      certainly to be connected with the times of the Messiah,
      and should come then to its last decisive issues, John, on
      the other hand, writing from the commencement of the
      Messiah&#39;s times, describes there the last struggles and
      victories of the cause of Christ. In both cases alike the
      vision describes the final workings of the world&#39;s evil
      and its results in connection with the kingdom of God, only
      the starting-point is placed further in advance in the one
      case than in the other.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       It has been supposed to be the name of a district in the
      wild north-east steppes of Central Asia, north of the
      Hindu-Kush, now a part of Turkestan, a region about 2,000
      miles north-east of Nineveh.

      (Deut. 4:43), one of the three cities of refuge east of
      Jordan, about 12 miles north-east of the Sea of Galilee
      (Josh. 20:8). There are no further notices of it in
      Scripture. It became the head of the province of
      Gaulanitis, one of the four provinces into which Bashan was
      divided after the Babylonish captivity, and almost
      identical with the modern Jaulan, in Western Hauran, about
      39 miles in length and 18 in breath.</a>

      Chr. 3:5).</a>

    <p>
       (2.) Heb. segor, from its compactness, or as being

      out of the mine (Job 36:19, where it means simply riches).

    <p>
       (5.) Heb. kethem, i.e., something concealed or separated
      (Job 28:16,19; Ps. 45:9; Prov. 25:12). Rendered
      &quot;golden wedge&quot; in Isa. 13:12.

    </p>
    <p>
       Gold was known from the earliest times (Gen. 2:11). It was
      principally used for ornaments (Gen. 24:22). It was very
      abundant (1 Chr. 22:14; Nah. 2:9; Dan. 3:1). Many tons of
      it were used in connection with the temple (2 Chr. 1:15).
      It was found in Arabia, Sheba, and Ophir (1 Kings 9:28;
      10:1; Job 28:16), but not in Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
       In Dan. 2:38, the Babylonian Empire is spoken of as a
      &quot;head of gold&quot; because of its great riches; and
      Babylon was called by Isaiah (14:4) the &quot;golden
      city&quot; (R.V. marg., &quot;exactress,&quot; adopting the
      reading <i>marhebah</i>, instead of the usual word <i>
      madhebah</i>).

      9:16; Neh. 9:18). This was a molten image of a calf which
      the idolatrous Israelites formed at Sinai. This symbol was
      borrowed from the custom of the Egyptians. It was destroyed
      at the command of Moses (Ex. 32:20). (See AARON

       <a name="T0001522"><b>Golgotha -</b> the common name of
      the spot where Jesus was crucified. It is interpreted by
      the evangelists as meaning &quot;the place of a skull&quot;
      (Matt. 27:33; Mark 15:22; John 19:17). This name represents
      in Greek letters the Aramaic word Gulgaltha, which is the
      Hebrew Gulgoleth (Num. 1:2; 1 Chr. 23:3, 24; 2 Kings 9:35),
      meaning &quot;a skull.&quot; It is identical with the word
      Calvary (q.v.). It was a little knoll rounded like a bare
      skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it was some
      well-known spot outside the gate (comp. Heb. 13:12), and
      near the city (Luke 23:26), containing a &quot;garden&quot;
      (John 19:41), and on a thoroughfare leading into the
      country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced
      within the present &quot;Church of the Holy
      Sepulchre.&quot; The hillock above Jeremiah&#39;s Grotto,
      to the north of the city, is in all probability the true
      site of Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in
      the southern precipice of the hillock is very
      remarkable.</a>

       <a name="T0001523"><b>Goliath -</b> great. (1.) A famous
      giant of Gath, who for forty days openly defied the armies
      of Israel, but was at length slain by David with a stone
      from a sling (1 Sam. 17:4). He was probably descended from
      the Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after
      they were dispersed by the Ammonites (Deut. 2:20, 21). His
      height was &quot;six cubits and a span,&quot; which, taking
      the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet. David cut
      off his head (1 Sam. 17:51) and brought it to Jerusalem,
      while he hung the armour which he took from him in his
      tent. His sword was preserved at Nob as a religious trophy
      (21:9). David&#39;s victory over Goliath was the turning
      point in his life. He came into public notice now as the
      deliverer of Israel and the chief among Saul&#39;s men of
      war (18:5), and the devoted friend of Jonathan.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) In 2 Sam. 21:19 there is another giant of the same
      name mentioned as slain by Elhanan. The staff of his apear
      &quot;was like a weaver&#39;s beam.&quot; The Authorized
      Version interpolates the words &quot;the brother of&quot;
      from 1 Chr. 20:5, where this giant is called Lahmi.

      (1.) The daughter of Diblaim, who (probably in vision only)
      became the wife of Hosea (1:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) The eldest son of Japheth, and father of Ashkenaz,
      Riphath, and Togarmah (Gen. 10:2, 3), whose descendants
      formed the principal branch of the population of
      South-eastern Europe. He is generally regarded as the
      ancestor of the Celtae and the Cimmerii, who in early times
      settled to the north of the Black Sea, and gave their name
      to the Crimea, the ancient Chersonesus Taurica. Traces of
      their presence are found in the names Cimmerian Bosphorus,
      Cimmerian Isthmus, etc. In the seventh century B.C. they
      were driven out of their original seat by the Scythians,
      and overran western Asia Minor, whence they were afterwards
      expelled. They subsequently reappear in the times of the
      Romans as the Cimbri of the north and west of Europe,
      whence they crossed to the British Isles, where their
      descendants are still found in the Gaels and Cymry. Thus
      the whole Celtic race may be regarded as descended from
      Gomer.

       <a name="T0001525"><b>Gomorrah -</b> submersion, one of
      the five cities of the plain of Siddim (q.v.) which were
      destroyed by fire (Gen. 10:19; 13:10; 19:24, 28). These
      cities probably stood close together, and were near the
      northern extremity of what is now the Dead Sea. This city
      is always mentioned next after Sodom, both of which were
      types of impiety and wickedness (Gen. 18:20; Rom. 9:29).
      Their destruction is mentioned as an &quot;ensample unto
      those that after should live ungodly&quot; (2 Pet. 2:6;
      Jude 1:4-7). Their wickedness became proverbial (Deut.
      32:32; Isa. 1:9, 10; Jer. 23:14). But that wickedness may
      be exceeded (Matt. 10:15; Mark 6:11). (See DEAD SEA

      to be carried in festive procession on the first day of the

      olive tree (Neh. 8:15), although no special tree is
      mentioned.</a>

       <a name="T0001527"><b>Goodness -</b> in man is not a mere
      passive quality, but the deliberate preference of right to
      wrong, the firm and persistent resistance of all moral
      evil, and the choosing and following of all moral good.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001528"><b>Goodness of God -</b> a perfection
      of his character which he exercises towards his creatures
      according to their various circumstances and relations (Ps.
      145:8, 9; 103:8; 1 John 4:8). Viewed generally, it is
      benevolence; as exercised with respect to the miseries of
      his creatures it is mercy, pity, compassion, and in the
      case of impenitent sinners, long-suffering patience; as
      exercised in communicating favour on the unworthy it is
      grace. &quot;Goodness and justice are the several aspects
      of one unchangeable, infinitely wise, and sovereign moral
      perfection. God is not sometimes merciful and sometimes
      just, but he is eternally infinitely just and
      merciful.&quot; God is infinitely and unchangeably good
      (Zeph. 3:17), and his goodness is incomprehensible by the
      finite mind (Rom. 11: 35, 36). &quot;God&#39;s goodness
      appears in two things, giving and forgiving.&quot;</a>

      which Noah was directed to build the ark (Gen. 6:14). It is
      mentioned only there. The LXX. render this word by
      &quot;squared beams,&quot; and the Vulgate by &quot;planed
      wood.&quot; Other versions have rendered it
      &quot;pine&quot; and &quot;cedar;&quot; but the weight of
      authority is in favour of understanding by it the cypress
      tree, which grows abundantly in Chaldea and Armenia.</a>

       <a name="T0001530"><b>Goshen -</b> (1.) A district in
      Egypt where Jacob and his family settled, and in which they
      remained till the Exodus (Gen. 45:10; 46:28, 29, 31, etc.).
      It is called &quot;the land of Goshen&quot; (47:27), and
      also simply &quot;Goshen&quot; (46:28), and &quot;the land
      of Rameses&quot; (47:11; Ex. 12:37), for the towns Pithom
      and Rameses lay within its borders; also Zoan or Tanis (Ps.
      78:12). It lay on the east of the Nile, and apparently not
      far from the royal residence. It was &quot;the best of the
      land&quot; (Gen. 47:6, 11), but is now a desert. It is
      first mentioned in Joseph&#39;s message to his father. It
      has been identified with the modern Wady Tumilat, lying
      between the eastern part of the Delta and the west border
      of Palestine. It was a pastoral district, where some of the
      king&#39;s cattle were kept (Gen. 47:6). The inhabitants
      were not exclusively Israelites (Ex. 3:22; 11:2; 12:35,
      36).</a>

    <p>
       (2.) A district in Palestine (Josh. 10:41; 11:16). It was
      a part of the maritime plain of Judah, and lay between Gaza
      and Gibeon.

       <a name="T0001531"><b>Gospel -</b> a word of Anglo-Saxon
      origin, and meaning &quot;God&#39;s spell&quot;, i.e., word
      of God, or rather, according to others, &quot;good
      spell&quot;, i.e., good news. It is the rendering of the
      Greek <i>evangelion</i>, i.e., &quot;good message.&quot; It
      denotes (1) &quot;the welcome intelligence of salvation to
      man as preached by our Lord and his followers. (2.) It was
      afterwards transitively applied to each of the four
      histories of our Lord&#39;s life, published by those who
      are therefore called &#39;Evangelists&#39;, writers of the
      history of the gospel (the evangelion). (3.) The term is
      often used to express collectively the gospel doctrines;
      and &#39;preaching the gospel&#39; is often used to include
      not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the
      teaching men how to avail themselves of the offer of
      salvation, the declaring of all the truths, precepts,
      promises, and threatenings of Christianity.&quot; It is
      termed &quot;the gospel of the grace of God&quot; (Acts
      20:24), &quot;the gospel of the kingdom&quot; (Matt. 4:23),
      &quot;the gospel of Christ&quot; (Rom. 1:16), &quot;the
      gospel of peace (Eph. 6:15), &quot;the glorious
      gospel,&quot; &quot;the everlasting gospel,&quot; &quot;the
      gospel of salvation&quot; (Eph. 1:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001532"><b>Gospels -</b> The central fact of
      Christian preaching was the intelligence that the Saviour
      had come into the world (Matt. 4:23; Rom. 10:15); and the
      first Christian preachers who called their account of the
      person and mission of Christ by the term <i>evangelion_ (=
      good message) were called _evangelistai</i> (= evangelists)
      (Eph. 4:11; Acts 21:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       There are four historical accounts of the person and work
      of Christ: &quot;the first by Matthew, announcing the
      Redeemer as the promised King of the kingdom of God; the
      second by Mark, declaring him &#39;a prophet, mighty in
      deed and word&#39;; the third by Luke, of whom it might be
      said that he represents Christ in the special character of
      the Saviour of sinners (Luke 7:36; 15:18); the fourth by
      John, who represents Christ as the Son of God, in whom
      deity and humanity become one. The ancient Church gave to
      Matthew the symbol of the lion, to Mark that of a man, to
      Luke that of the ox, and to John that of the eagle: these
      were the four faces of the cherubim&quot; (Ezek. 1:10).
    </p>
    <p>
       Date. The Gospels were all composed during the latter part
      of the first century, and there is distinct historical
      evidence to show that they were used and accepted as
      authentic before the end of the second century.
    </p>
    <p>
       Mutual relation. &quot;If the extent of all the
      coincidences be represented by 100, their proportionate
      distribution will be: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, 53; Matthew
      and Luke, 21; Matthew and Mark, 20; Mark and Luke, 6.
      Looking only at the general result, it may be said that of
      the contents of the synoptic Gospels [i.e., the first three
      Gospels] about two-fifths are common to the three, and that
      the parts peculiar to one or other of them are little more
      than one-third of the whole.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       Origin. Did the evangelists copy from one another? The
      opinion is well founded that the Gospels were published by
      the apostles orally before they were committed to writing,
      and that each had an independent origin. (See MATTHEW,
      GOSPEL <a href=

       <a name="T0001533"><b>Gourd -</b> (1.) Jonah&#39;s gourd
      (Jonah 4:6-10), bearing the Hebrew name <i>kikayon</i>
      (found only here), was probably the kiki of the Egyptians,
      the croton. This is the castor-oil plant, a species of
      ricinus, the palma Christi, so called from the palmate
      division of its leaves. Others with more probability regard
      it as the cucurbita the el-keroa of the Arabs, a kind of
      pumpkin peculiar to the East. &quot;It is grown in great
      abundance on the alluvial banks of the Tigris and on the
      plain between the river and the ruins of Nineveh.&quot; At
      the present day it is trained to run over structures of mud
      and brush to form boots to protect the gardeners from the
      heat of the noon-day sun. It grows with extraordinary
      rapidity, and when cut or injured withers away also with
      great rapidity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Wild gourds (2 Kings 4:38-40), Heb. pakkuoth, belong
      to the family of the cucumber-like plants, some of which
      are poisonous. The species here referred to is probably the
      colocynth (Cucumis colocynthus). The LXX. render the word
      by &quot;wild pumpkin.&quot; It abounds in the desert parts
      of Syria, Egypt, and Arabia. There is, however, another
      species, called the Cucumis prophetarum, from the idea that
      it afforded the gourd which &quot;the sons of the
      prophets&quot; shred by mistake into their pottage.

      Jerusalem (Ezra 9:2; Neh. 2:16; 4:14, 19; 5:7, 17; 7:5;
      12:40).
    </p>
    <p>
       In the New Testament there are also different Greek words
      rendered thus.
    </p>
    <p>
       (1.) Meaning an ethnarch (2 Cor. 11:32), which was an
      office distinct from military command, with considerable
      latitude of application.
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) The procurator of Judea under the Romans (Matt.
      27:2). (Comp. Luke 2:2, where the verb from which the Greek
      word so rendered is derived is used.)
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Steward (Gal. 4:2).
    </p>
    <p>
       (4.) Governor of the feast (John 2:9), who appears here to
      have been merely an intimate friend of the bridegroom, and
      to have presided at the marriage banquet in his stead.
    </p>
    <p>
       (5.) A director, i.e., helmsman; Lat. gubernator, (James
      3:4).

       <a name="T0001537"><b>Gozan -</b> a region in Central Asia
      to which the Israelites were carried away captive (2 Kings
      17:6; 1 Chr. 5:26; 2 Kings 19:12; Isa. 37:12). It was
      situated in Mesopotamia, on the river Habor (2 Kings 17:6;
      18:11), the Khabur, a tributary of the Euphrates. The
      &quot;river of Gozan&quot; (1 Chr. 5:26) is probably the
      upper part of the river flowing through the province of
      Gozan, now Kizzel-Ozan.</a>

       <a name="T0001538"><b>Grace -</b> (1.) Of form or person
      (Prov. 1:9; 3:22; Ps. 45:2). (2.) Favour, kindness,
      friendship (Gen. 6:8; 18:3; 19:19; 2 Tim. 1:9). (3.)
      God&#39;s forgiving mercy (Rom. 11:6; Eph. 2:5). (4.) The
      gospel as distinguished from the law (John 1:17; Rom. 6:14;
      1 Pet. 5:12). (5.) Gifts freely bestowed by God; as
      miracles, prophecy, tongues (Rom. 15:15; 1 Cor. 15:10; Eph.
      3:8). (6.) Christian virtues (2 Cor. 8:7; 2 Pet. 3:18).
      (7.) The glory hereafter to be revealed (1 Pet. 1:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001539"><b>Grace, means of -</b> an expression
      not used in Scripture, but employed (1) to denote those
      institutions ordained by God to be the ordinary channels of
      grace to the souls of men. These are the Word, Sacraments,
      and Prayer.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) But in popular language the expression is used in a
      wider sense to denote those exercises in which we engage
      for the purpose of obtaining spiritual blessing; as hearing
      the gospel, reading the Word, meditation, self-examination,
      Christian conversation, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001540"><b>Graft -</b> the process of
      inoculating fruit-trees (Rom. 11:17-24). It is peculiarly
      appropriate to olive-trees. The union thus of branches to a
      stem is used to illustrate the union of true believers to
      the true Church.</a>

    <p>
       <a name="T0001541"><b>Grain -</b> used, in Amos 9:9, of a
      small stone or kernel; in Matt. 13:31, of an individual
      seed of mustard; in John 12:24, 1 Cor. 15:37, of wheat. The
      Hebrews sowed only wheat, barley, and spelt; rye and oats
      are not mentioned in Scripture.</a>

    <p>
       <a name="T0001542"><b>Grape -</b> the fruit of the vine,
      which was extensively cultivated in Palestine. Grapes are
      spoken of as &quot;tender&quot; (Cant. 2:13, 15),
      &quot;unripe&quot; (Job 15:33), &quot;sour&quot; (Isa.
      18:5), &quot;wild&quot; (Isa. 5:2,4). (See Rev. 14:18;
      Micah 7:1; Jer. 6:9; Ezek. 18:2, for figurative use of the
      word.) (See <a href=

       <a name="T0001543"><b>Grass -</b> (1.) Heb. hatsir, ripe
      grass fit for mowing (1 Kings 18:5; Job 40:15; Ps. 104:14).
      As the herbage rapidly fades under the scorching sun, it is
      used as an image of the brevity of human life (Isa. 40:6,
      7; Ps. 90:5). In Num. 11:5 this word is rendered
      &quot;leeks.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. deshe&#39;, green grass (Gen. 1:11, 12; Isa.
      66:14; Deut. 32:2). &quot;The sickly and forced blades of
      grass which spring up on the flat plastered roofs of houses
      in the East are used as an emblem of speedy destruction,
      because they are small and weak, and because, under the
      scorching rays of the sun, they soon wither away&quot; (2
      Kings 19:26; Ps. 129:6; Isa. 37:27).
    </p>
    <p>
       The dry stalks of grass were often used as fuel for the
      oven (Matt. 6:30; 13:30; Luke 12:28).

       <a name="T0001544"><b>Grasshopper -</b> belongs to the
      class of neuropterous insects called Gryllidae. This insect
      is not unknown in Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       In Judg. 6:5; 7:12; Job 39:30; Jer. 46:23, where the
      Authorized Version has &quot;grasshopper,&quot; the Revised
      Version more correctly renders the Hebrew word (&#39;arbeh)
      by &quot;locust.&quot; This is the case also in Amos 7:1;
      Nah. 3:17, where the Hebrew word <i>gob</i> is used; and in
      Lev. 11:22; Num. 13:33; Eccl. 12:5; Isa. 40:22, where <i>
      hagab</i> is used. In all these instances the proper
      rendering is probably &quot;locust&quot; (q.v.).

      the bottom of the great altar of sacrifice (Ex. 27:4;

    <p>
       <a name="T0001546"><b>Grave -</b> Among the ancient
      Hebrews graves were outside of cities in the open field
      (Luke 7:12; John 11:30). Kings (1 Kings 2:10) and prophets
      (1 Sam. 25:1) were generally buried within cities. Graves
      were generally grottoes or caves, natural or hewn out in
      rocks (Isa. 22:16; Matt. 27:60). There were family
      cemeteries (Gen. 47:29; 50:5; 2 Sam. 19:37). Public
      burial-places were assigned to the poor (Jer. 26:23; 2
      Kings 23:6). Graves were usually closed with stones, which
      were whitewashed, to warn strangers against contact with
      them (Matt. 23:27), which caused ceremonial pollution (Num.
      19:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       There were no graves in Jerusalem except those of the
      kings, and according to tradition that of the prophetess
      Huldah.

    <p>
       <a name="T0001547"><b>Graven image -</b> Deut. 27:15; Ps.
      97:7 (Heb. pesel), refers to the household gods of
      idolaters. &quot;Every nation and city had its own
      gods...Yet every family had its separate household or
      tutelary god.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001548"><b>Graving -</b> (1.) Heb. hatsabh. Job
      19:24, rendered &quot;graven,&quot; but generally means
      hewn stone or wood, in quarry or forest.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. harush. Jer. 17:1, rendered &quot;graven,&quot;
      and indicates generally artistic work in metal, wood, and
      stone, effected by fine instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Heb. haqaq. Ezek. 4:1, engraving a plan or map,
      rendered &quot;pourtray;&quot; Job 19:23,
      &quot;written.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       (4.) Heb. pasal points rather to the sculptor&#39;s or the
      carver&#39;s art (Isa. 30:22; 40:19; 41:7; 44:12-15).
    </p>
    <p>
       (5.) Pathah refers to intaglio work, the cutting and
      engraving of precious stones (Ex. 28:9-11, 21; Zech. 3:9;
      Cant. 1:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
       (6.) Heret. In Ex. 32:4 rendered &quot;graving tool;&quot;
      and in Isa. 8:1, &quot;a pen.&quot;

      piece of defensive armour (q.v.) reaching from the foot to
      the knee; from French greve, &quot;the shin.&quot; They
      were the Roman cothurni.</a>

    <p>
       <a name="T0001550"><b>Grecians -</b> Hellenists,
      Greek-Jews; Jews born in a foreign country, and thus did
      not speak Hebrew (Acts 6:1; 9:29), nor join in the Hebrew
      services of the Jews in Palestine, but had synagogues of
      their own in Jerusalem. Joel 3:6 =Greeks.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001551"><b>Greece -</b> orginally consisted of
      the four provinces of Macedonia, Epirus, Achaia, and
      Peleponnesus. In Acts 20:2 it designates only the Roman
      province of Macedonia. Greece was conquered by the Romans
      B.C. 146. After passing through various changes it was
      erected into an independent monarchy in 1831.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       Moses makes mention of Greece under the name of Javan
      (Gen. 10:2-5); and this name does not again occur in the
      Old Testament till the time of Joel (3:6). Then the Greeks
      and Hebrews first came into contact in the Tyrian
      slave-market. Prophetic notice is taken of Greece in Dan.
      8:21.
    </p>
    <p>
       The cities of Greece were the special scenes of the
      labours of the apostle Paul.

       <a name="T0001552"><b>Greek -</b> Found only in the New
      Testament, where a distinction is observed between
      &quot;Greek&quot; and &quot;Grecian&quot; (q.v.). The
      former is (1) a Greek by race (Acts 16:1-3; 18:17; Rom.
      1:14), or (2) a Gentile as opposed to a Jew (Rom. 2:9, 10).
      The latter, meaning properly &quot;one who speaks
      Greek,&quot; is a foreign Jew opposed to a home Jew who
      dwelt in Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The word &quot;Grecians&quot; in Acts 11:20 should be
      &quot;Greeks,&quot; denoting the heathen Greeks of that
      city, as rendered in the Revised Version according to the
      reading of the best manuscripts (&quot;Hellenes&quot;).

    <p>
       <a name="T0001553"><b>Greyhound -</b> (Prov. 30:31), the
      rendering of the Hebrew <i>zarzir mothnayim</i>, meaning
      literally &quot;girded as to the lions.&quot; Some (Gesen.;
      R.V. marg.) render it &quot;war-horse.&quot; The LXX. and
      Vulgate versions render it &quot;cock.&quot; It has been by
      some interpreters rendered also &quot;stag&quot; and
      &quot;warrior,&quot; as being girded about or panoplied,
      and &quot;wrestler.&quot; The greyhound, however, was
      evidently known in ancient times, as appears from Egyptian
      monuments.</a>

       <a name="T0001554"><b>Grind -</b> (Ex. 32:20; Deut. 9:21;
      Judg. 16:21), to crush small (Heb. tahan); to oppress the
      poor (Isa. 3:5). The hand-mill was early used by the
      Hebrews (Num. 11:8). It consisted of two stones, the upper
      (Deut. 24:6; 2 Sam. 11:21) being movable and slightly
      concave, the lower being stationary. The grinders mentioned
      Eccl. 12:3 are the teeth. (See <a href=

    <p>
       <a name="T0001556"><b>Grove -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;asherah,
      properly a wooden image, or a pillar representing
      Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess, probably usually
      set up in a grove (2 Kings 21:7; 23:4). In the Revised
      Version the word &quot;Asherah&quot; (q.v.) is introduced
      as a proper noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a
      goddess, with the plurals Asherim (Ex. 34:13) and Asheroth
      (Judg. 3:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The LXX. have rendered <i>asherah</i> in 2 Chr. 15:16 by
      &quot;Astarte.&quot; The Vulgate has done this also in
      Judg. 3:7.
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. &#39;eshel (Gen. 21:33). In 1 Sam. 22:6 and
      31:13 the Authorized Version renders this word by
      &quot;tree.&quot; In all these passages the Revised Version
      renders by &quot;tamarisk tree.&quot; It has been
      identified with the Tamariscus orientalis, five species of
      which are found in Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) The Heb. word &#39;elon, uniformly rendered in the
      Authorized Version by &quot;plain,&quot; properly signifies
      a grove or plantation. In the Revised Version it is
      rendered, pl., &quot;oaks&quot; (Gen. 13:18; 14:13; 18:1;
      12:6; Deut. 11:30; Josh. 19:33). In the earliest times
      groves are mentioned in connection with religious worship.
      The heathen consecrated groves to particular gods, and for
      this reason they were forbidden to the Jews (Jer. 17:3;
      Ezek. 20:28).
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001557"><b>Guard -</b> (1.) Heb. tabbah
      (properly a &quot;cook,&quot; and in a secondary sense
      &quot;executioner,&quot; because this office fell to the
      lot of the cook in Eastern countries), the bodyguard of the
      kings of Egypt (Gen. 37:36) and Babylon (2 Kings 25:8; Jer.
      40:1; Dan. 2:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       (2.) Heb. rats, properly a &quot;courier,&quot; one whose
      office was to run before the king&#39;s chariot (2 Sam.
      15:1; 1 Kings 1:5). The couriers were also military guards
      (1 Sam. 22:17; 2 Kings 10:25). They were probably the same
      who under David were called Pelethites (1 Kings 14:27; 2
      Sam. 15:1).
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Heb. mishmereth, one who watches (Neh. 4:22), or a
      watch-station (7:3; 12:9; Job 7:12).
    </p>
    <p>
       In the New Testament (Mark 6:27) the Authorized Version
      renders the Greek <i>spekulator</i> by
      &quot;executioner,&quot; earlier English versions by
      &quot;hangman,&quot; the Revised Version by &quot;soldier
      of his guard.&quot; The word properly means a
      &quot;pikeman&quot; or &quot;halberdier,&quot; of whom the
      bodyguard of kings and princes was composed. In Matt.
      27:65, 66; 28:11, the Authorized Version renders the Greek
      <i>kustodia</i> by &quot;watch,&quot; and the Revised
      Version by &quot;guard,&quot; the Roman guard, which
      consisted of four soldiers, who were relieved every three
      hours (Acts 12:4). The &quot;captain of the guard&quot;
      mentioned Acts 28:16 was the commander of the Praetorian
      troops, whose duty it was to receive and take charge of all
      prisoners from the provinces.

      5:8). This Hebrew word occurs only elsewhere in Ps. 42:7 in
      the plural, where it is rendered &quot;waterspouts.&quot;
      It denotes some passage through which water passed; a
      water-course.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       In Gen. 30:38, 41 the Hebrew word rendered
      &quot;gutters&quot; is <i>rahat</i>, and denotes vessels
      overflowing with water for cattle (Ex. 2:16);
      drinking-troughs.

       <a name="T0001562"><b>Habakkuk -</b> embrace, the eighth
      of the twelve minor prophets. Of his personal history we

      probably written about B.C. 650-627, or, as some think, a
      few years later. This book consists of three chapters, the
      contents of which are thus comprehensively described:
      &quot;When the prophet in spirit saw the formidable power
      of the Chaldeans approaching and menacing his land, and saw
      the great evils they would cause in Judea, he bore his
      complaints and doubts before Jehovah, the just and the pure
      (1:2-17). And on this occasion the future punishment of the
      Chaldeans was revealed to him (2). In the third chapter a
      presentiment of the destruction of his country, in the
      inspired heart of the prophet, contends with his hope that
      the enemy would be chastised.&quot; The third chapter is a
      sublime song dedicated &quot;to the chief musician,&quot;
      and therefore intended apparently to be used in the worship
      of God. It is &quot;unequalled in majesty and splendour of
      language and imagery.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       The passage in 2:4, &quot;The just shall live by his
      faith,&quot; is quoted by the apostle in Rom. 1:17. (Comp.
      Gal. 3:12; Heb. 10:37, 38.)

       <a name="T0001564"><b>Habergeon -</b> an Old English word
      for breastplate. In Job 41:26 (Heb. shiryah) it is properly
      a &quot;coat of mail;&quot; the Revised Version has

      a military garment strongly and thickly woven and covered

      habitation of his people, who find rest and safety in him
      (Ps. 71:3; 91:9). Justice and judgment are the habitation
      of God&#39;s throne (Ps. 89:14, Heb. mekhon,
      &quot;foundation&quot;), because all his acts are founded
      on justice and judgment. (See Ps. 132:5, 13; Eph. 2:22, of
      Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as God&#39;s habitation.)
      God inhabits eternity (Isa. 57:15), i.e., dwells not only
      among men, but in eternity, where time is unknown; and
      &quot;the praises of Israel&quot; (Ps. 22:3), i.e., he
      dwells among those praises and is continually surrounded by
      them.</a>

       <a name="T0001566"><b>Habor -</b> the united stream, or,
      according to others, with beautiful banks, the name of a
      river in Assyria, and also of the district through which it
      flowed (1 Chr. 5:26). There is a river called Khabur which
      rises in the central highlands of Kurdistan, and flows
      south-west till it falls into the Tigris, about 70 miles
      above Mosul. This was not, however, the Habor of
      Scripture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       There is another river of the same name (the Chaboras)
      which, after a course of about 200 miles, flows into the
      Euphrates at Karkesia, the ancient Circesium. This was,
      there can be little doubt, the ancient Habor.

      one of the peaks of the long ridge of el-Kolah, running out
      of the Ziph plateau, &quot;on the south of Jeshimon&quot;
      (i.e., of the &quot;waste&quot;), the district to which one
      looks down from the plateau of Ziph (1 Sam. 23:19). After
      his reconciliation with Saul at Engedi (24:1-8), David
      returned to Hachilah, where he had fixed his quarters. The
      Ziphites treacherously informed Saul of this, and he
      immediately (26:1-4) renewed his pursuit of David, and
      &quot;pitched in the hill of Hachilah.&quot; David and his
      nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul&#39;s
      camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed
      the royal spear and the cruse from the side of the king,
      and then, crossing the intervening valley to the height on
      the other side, David cried to the people, and thus awoke
      the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who recognized his
      voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be
      penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he
      now sought refuge at Ziklag. David and Saul never
      afterwards met. (1 Sam. 26:13-25).</a>

    </p>
    <p>

      Hanun, the king of the Ammonites, hired among others the
      army of Hadadezer to assist him in his war against David.
      Joab, who was sent against this confederate host, found
      them in double battle array, the Ammonities toward their
      capital of Rabbah, and the Syrian mercenaries near Medeba.
      In the battle which was fought the Syrians were scattered,
      and the Ammonites in alarm fled into their capital. After
      this Hadadezer went north &quot;to recover his border&quot;
      (2 Sam. 8:3, A.V.); but rather, as the Revised Version
      renders, &quot;to recover his dominion&quot;, i.e., to
      recruit his forces. Then followed another battle with the
      Syrian army thus recruited, which resulted in its being
      totally routed at Helam (2 Sam. 10:17). Shobach, the leader
      of the Syrian army, died on the field of battle. The
      Syrians of Damascus, who had come to help Hadadezer, were
      also routed, and Damascus was made tributary to David. All
      the spoils taken in this war, &quot;shields of gold&quot;
      and &quot;very much brass,&quot; from which afterwards the
      &quot;brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of
      brass&quot; for the temple were made (1 Chr. 18:8), were
      brought to Jerusalem and dedicated to Jehovah. Thus the
      power of the Ammonites and the Syrians was finally broken,
      and David&#39;s empire extended to the Euphrates (2 Sam.
      10:15-19; 1 Chr. 19:15-19).</a>

       <a name="T0001570"><b>Hadad-rimmon -</b> (composed of the
      names of two Syrian idols), the name of a place in the
      valley of Megiddo. It is alluded to by the prophet
      Zechariah (12:11) in a proverbial expression derived from
      the lamentation for Josiah, who was mortally wounded near
      this place (2 Chr. 35:22-25). It has been identified with
      the modern Rummaneh, a village &quot;at the foot of the
      Megiddo hills, in a notch or valley about an hour and a

       <a name="T0001576"><b>Hades -</b> that which is out of
      sight, a Greek word used to denote the state or place of
      the dead. All the dead alike go into this place. To be
      buried, to go down to the grave, to descend into hades, are
      equivalent expressions. In the LXX. this word is the usual
      rendering of the Hebrew sheol, the common receptacle of the
      departed (Gen. 42:38; Ps. 139:8; Hos. 13:14; Isa. 14:9).
      This term is of comparatively rare occurrence in the Greek
      New Testament. Our Lord speaks of Capernaum as being
      &quot;brought down to hell&quot; (hades), i.e., simply to
      the lowest debasement, (Matt. 11:23). It is contemplated as
      a kind of kingdom which could never overturn the foundation
      of Christ&#39;s kingdom (16:18), i.e., Christ&#39;s church
      can never die.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       In Luke 16:23 it is most distinctly associated with the
      doom and misery of the lost.
    </p>
    <p>
       In Acts 2:27-31 Peter quotes the LXX. version of Ps.
      16:8-11, plainly for the purpose of proving our Lord&#39;s
      resurrection from the dead. David was left in the place of
      the dead, and his body saw corruption. Not so with Christ.
      According to ancient prophecy (Ps. 30:3) he was recalled to
      life.

      mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending
      apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the
      desert of Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had
      reached the place she distinguished by the name of
      Beer-lahai-roi (&quot;the well of the visible God&quot;),
      where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience
      to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of
      Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she
      remained (16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of
      fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her
      dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael&#39;s
      conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he
      and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly
      done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham (Gen.
      21:14). They wandered out into the wilderness, where
      Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst,
      seemed about to die. Hagar &quot;lifted up her voice and
      wept,&quot; and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared
      unto her, and she was comforted and delivered out of her
      distresses (Gen. 21:18, 19).</a>

      about one hundred years later, being the other two) whose
      ministry belonged to the period of Jewish history which
      began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely

      The work of rebuilding the temple had been put a stop to
      through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having been

      the Persian government. (See DARIUS &macr;T0000975 [2].)

      of the gifted seers of all times, to compel their hearers

       (2.) A precisely opposite practice, as regards men,
      prevailed among the Assyrians. In Assyrian sculptures the
      hair always appears long, and combed closely down upon the
      head. The beard also was allowed to grow to its full
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
       (3.) Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied at
      different times, as it did also among the Romans. In the
      time of the apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short
      hair, while that of the women was long (1 Cor. 11:14, 15).
      Paul reproves the Corinthians for falling in with a style
      of manners which so far confounded the distinction of the
      sexes and was hurtful to good morals. (See, however, 1 Tim.
      2:9, and 1 Pet. 3:3, as regards women.)
    </p>
    <p>
       (4.) Among the Hebrews the natural distinction between the
      sexes was preserved by the women wearing long hair (Luke
      7:38; John 11:2; 1 Cor. 11:6), while the men preserved
      theirs as a rule at a moderate length by frequent clipping.

       Baldness disqualified any one for the priest&#39;s office
      (Lev. 21).

    <p>
       Elijah is called a &quot;hairy man&quot; (2 Kings 1:8)
      from his flowing locks, or more probably from the shaggy
      cloak of hair which he wore. His raiment was of camel&#39;s
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
       Long hair is especially noticed in the description of
      Absalom&#39;s person (2 Sam. 14:26); but the wearing of
      long hair was unusual, and was only practised as an act of
      religious observance by Nazarites (Num. 6:5; Judg. 13:5)
      and others in token of special mercies (Acts 18:18).
    </p>
    <p>
       In times of affliction the hair was cut off (Isa. 3:17,
      24; 15:2; 22:12; Jer. 7:29; Amos 8:10). Tearing the hair
      and letting it go dishevelled were also tokens of grief
      (Ezra 9:3). &quot;Cutting off the hair&quot; is a figure of
      the entire destruction of a people (Isa. 7:20). The Hebrews
      anointed the hair profusely with fragrant ointments (Ruth
      3:3; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 45:7, etc.), especially in
      seasons of rejoicing (Matt. 6:17; Luke 7:46).

       <a name="T0001593"><b>Halah -</b> a district of Media to
      which captive Israelites were transported by the Assyrian
      kings (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11; 1 Chr. 5:26). It lay along the
      banks of the upper Khabur, from its source to its junction
      with the Jerujer. Probably the district called by Ptolemy
      Chalcitis.</a>

       <a name="T0001594"><b>Halak -</b> smooth; bald, a hill at
      the southern extremity of Canaan (Josh. 11:17). It is
      referred to as if it were a landmark in that direction,
      being prominent and conspicuous from a distance. It has by
      some been identified with the modern Jebel el-Madura, on
      the south frontier of Judah, between the south end of the
      Dead Sea and the Wady Gaian.</a>

       <a name="T0001595"><b>Halhul -</b> full of hollows, a town
      in the highlands of Judah (Josh. 15:58). It is now a small
      village of the same name, and is situated about 5 miles
      north-east of Hebron on the way to Jerusalem. There is an
      old Jewish tradition that Gad, David&#39;s seer (2 Sam.
      24:11), was buried here.</a>

    <p>
       <a name="T0001596"><b>Hall -</b> (Gr. aule, Luke 22:55;
      R.V., &quot;court&quot;), the open court or quadrangle
      belonging to the high priest&#39;s house. In Matt. 26:69
      and Mark 14:66 this word is incorrectly rendered
      &quot;palace&quot; in the Authorized Version, but correctly
      &quot;court&quot; in the Revised Version. In John 10:1,16
      it means a &quot;sheep-fold.&quot; In Matt. 27:27 and Mark
      15:16 (A.V., &quot;common hall;&quot; R.V.,
      &quot;palace&quot;) it refers to the proetorium or
      residence of the Roman governor at Jerusalem. The
      &quot;porch&quot; in Matt. 26:71 is the entrance-hall or
      passage leading into the central court, which is open to
      the sky.</a>

       <a name="T0001597"><b>Hallel -</b> praise, the name given
      to the group of Psalms 113-118, which are preeminently
      psalms of praise. It is called &quot;The Egyptian
      Hallel,&quot; because it was chanted in the temple whilst
      the Passover lambs were being slain. It was chanted also on
      other festival occasions, as at Pentecost, the feast of
      Tabernacles, and the feast of Dedication. The Levites,
      standing before the altar, chanted it verse by verse, the
      people responding by repeating the verses or by intoned
      hallelujahs. It was also chanted in private families at the
      feast of Passover. This was probably the hymn which our
      Saviour and his disciples sung at the conclusion of the
      Passover supper kept by them in the upper room at Jerusalem
      (Matt. 26:30; Mark 14:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       There is also another group called &quot;The Great
      Hallel,&quot; comprehending Psalms 118-136, which was
      recited on the first evening at the Passover supper and on
      occasions of great joy.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a name="T0001598"><b>Hallelujah -</b> praise ye Jehovah,
      frequently rendered &quot;Praise ye the LORD,&quot; stands
      at the beginning of ten of the psalms (106, 111-113, 135,
      146-150), hence called &quot;hallelujah psalms.&quot; From
      its frequent occurrence it grew into a formula of praise.
      The Greek form of the word (alleluia) is found in Rev.
      19:1, 3, 4, 6.</a>

    <p>
       <a name="T0001599"><b>Hallow -</b> to render sacred, to
      consecrate (Ex. 28:38; 29:1). This word is from the Saxon,
      and properly means &quot;to make holy.&quot; The name of
      God is &quot;hallowed&quot;, i.e., is reverenced as holy
      (Matt. 6:9).</a>
