      <a name="T0001600"><b>Halt -</b> lame on the feet (Gen.
      32:31; Ps. 38:17). To &quot;halt between two opinions&quot;
      (1 Kings 18:21) is supposed by some to be an expression
      used in &quot;allusion to birds, which hop from spray to
      spray, forwards and backwards.&quot; The LXX. render the
      expression &quot;How long go ye lame on both knees?&quot;
      The Hebrew verb rendered &quot;halt&quot; is used of the
      irregular dance (&quot;leaped upon&quot;) around the altar
      (ver. 26). It indicates a lame, uncertain gait, going now
      in one direction, now in another, in the frenzy of wild
      leaping.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001601"><b>Ham -</b> warm, hot, and hence the
      south; also an Egyptian word meaning &quot;black&quot;, the
      youngest son of Noah (Gen. 5:32; comp. 9:22,24). The curse
      pronounced by Noah against Ham, properly against Canaan his
      fourth son, was accomplished when the Jews subsequently
      exterminated the Canaanites.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important facts recorded in Gen. 10 is the
      foundation of the earliest monarchy in Babylonia by Nimrod
      the grandson of Ham (6, 8, 10). The primitive Babylonian
      empire was thus Hamitic, and of a cognate race with the
      primitive inhabitants of Arabia and of Ethiopia. (See <a

    </p>
    <p>
      The race of Ham were the most energetic of all the
      descendants of Noah in the early times of the post-diluvian
      world.

    <p>
      <a name="T0001602"><b>Haman -</b> (of Persian origin),
      magnificent, the name of the vizier (i.e., the prime
      minister) of the Persian king Ahasuerus (Esther 3:1, etc.).
      He is called an &quot;Agagite,&quot; which seems to denote
      that he was descended from the royal family of the
      Amalekites, the bitterest enemies of the Jews, as Agag was
      one of the titles of the Amalekite kings. He or his parents
      were brought to Persia as captives taken in war. He was
      hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai the
      Jew (Esther 7:10). (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0001603"><b>Hamath -</b> fortress, the capital of
      one of the kingdoms of Upper Syria of the same name, on the
      Orontes, in the valley of Lebanon, at the northern boundary
      of Palestine (Num. 13:21; 34:8), at the foot of Hermon
      (Josh. 13:5) towards Damascus (Zech. 9:2; Jer. 49:23). It
      is called &quot;Hamath the great&quot; in Amos 6:2, and
      &quot;Hamath-zobah&quot; in 2 Chr. 8:3.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite
      monuments discovered there show that it must have been at
      one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the
      conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or
      Toi, made alliance with David (2 Sam. 8:10), and in B.C.
      740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It
      was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen
      districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it
      revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded
      with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps shows that
      he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and
      the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria (2 Kings
      17:24, 30), where they continued to worship their god
      Ashima. Hamah is beautifully situated on the Orontes, 32
      miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the ruins of Assamea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain lying on
      both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to
      Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the
      desert on the east. The &quot;entrance of Hamath&quot;
      (Num. 34:8), which was the north boundary of Palestine, led
      from the west between the north end of Lebanon and the
      Nusairiyeh mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001604"><b>Hamath-zobah -</b> fortress of Zobah,
      (2 Chr. 8:3) is supposed by some to be a different place
      from the foregoing; but this is quite uncertain.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001605"><b>Hammath -</b> warm springs, one of
      the &quot;fenced cities&quot; of Naphtali (Josh. 19:35). It
      is identified with the warm baths (the heat of the water
      ranging from 136 degrees to 144 degrees) still found on the
      shore a little to the south of Tiberias under the name of
      Hummam Tabariyeh (&quot;Bath of Tiberias&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001606"><b>Hammedatha -</b> father of Haman,
      designated usually &quot;the Agagite&quot; (Esther 3:1, 10;
      8:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001607"><b>Hammelech -</b> the king&#39;s, the
      father of Jerahmeel, mentioned in Jer. 36:26. Some take
      this word as a common noun, &quot;the king&quot;, and
      understand that Jerahmeel was Jehoiakim&#39;s son.
      Probably, however, it is to be taken as a proper name.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001608"><b>Hammer -</b> (1.) Heb. pattish, used
      by gold-beaters (Isa. 41:7) and by quarry-men (Jer. 23:29).
      Metaphorically of Babylon (Jer. 50:23) or
      Nebuchadnezzar.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. makabah, a stone-cutter&#39;s mallet (1 Kings
      6:7), or of any workman (Judg. 4:21; Isa. 44:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. halmuth, a poetical word for a workman&#39;s
      hammer, found only in Judg. 5:26, where it denotes the
      mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad are
      driven into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. mappets, rendered &quot;battle-axe&quot; in Jer.
      51:20. This was properly a &quot;mace,&quot; which is thus
      described by Rawlinson: &quot;The Assyrian mace was a
      short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a
      very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It
      had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very
      beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or string at
      the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater
      firmness.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001609"><b>Hammoleketh -</b> the queen, the
      daughter of Machir and sister of Gilead (1 Chr. 7:17, 18).
      Abiezer was one of her three children.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001610"><b>Hammon -</b> warm springs. (1.) A
      town in the tribe of Asher, near Zidon (Josh. 19:28),
      identified with &#39;Ain Hamul.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levitical city of Naphtali (1 Chr. 6:76).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001611"><b>Hammoth-dor -</b> warm springs, a
      Levitical city of Naphtali (Josh. 21:32); probably Hammath
      in 19:35.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001612"><b>Hamon -</b> See BAAL-HAMON
      &macr;T0000390.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001613"><b>Hamonah -</b> multitude, a name
      figuratively assigned to the place in which the slaughter
      and burial of the forces of Gog were to take place (Ezek.
      39:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001614"><b>Hamon-gog -</b> multitude of Gog, the
      name of the valley in which the slaughtered forces of Gog
      are to be buried (Ezek. 39:11,15), &quot;the valley of the
      passengers on the east of the sea.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001615"><b>Hamor -</b> he-ass, a Hivite from
      whom Jacob purchased the plot of ground in which Joseph was
      afterwards buried (Gen. 33:19). He is called
      &quot;Emmor&quot; in Acts 7:16. His son Shechem founded the
      city of that name which Simeon and Levi destroyed because
      of his crime in the matter of Dinah, Jacob&#39;s daughter
      (Gen. 34:20). Hamor and Shechem were also slain (ver.
      26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001616"><b>Hamul -</b> spared, one of the sons
      of Pharez, son of Judah (1 Chr. 2:5). His descendants are
      called Hamulites (Num. 26:21).</a>

      <a name="T0001617"><b>Hamutal -</b> kinsman of the dew, the
      daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, wife of king Josiah, and

      Zedekiah (2 Kings 24:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001618"><b>Hanameel -</b> whom God has
      graciously given, the cousin of Jeremiah, to whom he sold
      the field he possessed in Anathoth, before the siege of
      Jerusalem (Jer. 32:6-12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001619"><b>Hanan -</b> merciful. (1.) A
      Benjamite (1 Chr. 8:23). (2.) One of David&#39;s heroes (1
      Chr. 11:43). (3.) Jer. 35:4. (4.) A descendant of Saul (1
      Chr. 8:38). (5.) One of the Nethinim (Ezra 2:46). (6.) One
      of the Levites who assisted Ezra (Neh. 8:7). (7.) One of
      the chiefs who subscribed the covenant (Neh. 10:22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001620"><b>Hananeel -</b> God has graciously
      given, a tower in the wall of Jerusalem (Neh. 3:1; 12:39).
      It is mentioned also in Jer. 31:38; Zech. 14:10.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001621"><b>Hanani -</b> God has gratified me, or
      is gracious. (1.) One of the sons of Heman (1 Chr. 25:4,
      25). (2.) A prophet who was sent to rebuke king Asa for
      entering into a league with Benhadad I., king of Syria,
      against Judah (2 Chr. 16:1-10). He was probably the father
      of the prophet Jehu (1 Kings 16:7). (3.) Probably a brother
      of Nehemiah (Neh. 1:2; 7:2), who reported to him the
      melancholy condition of Jerusalem. Nehemiah afterwards
      appointed him to have charge of the city gates.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001622"><b>Hananiah -</b> Jehovah has given.
      (1.) A chief of the tribe of Benjamin (1 Chr. 8:24). (2.)
      One of the sons of Heman (1 Chr. 25:4,23). (3.) One of
      Uzziah&#39;s military officers (2 Chr. 26:11). (4.)
      Grandfather of the captain who arrested Jeremiah (Jer.

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001623"><b>Hand -</b> Called by Galen &quot;the
      instrument of instruments.&quot; It is the symbol of human
      action (Ps. 9:16; Job 9:30; Isa. 1:15; 1 Tim. 2:8). Washing
      the hands was a symbol of innocence (Ps. 26:6; 73:13; Matt.
      27:24), also of sanctification (1 Cor. 6:11; Isa. 51:16;
      Ps. 24:3, 4). In Ps. 77:2 the correct rendering is, as in
      the Revised Version, &quot;My hand was stretched out,&quot;
      etc., instead of, as in the Authorized Version, &quot;My
      sore ran in the night,&quot; etc.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The right hand denoted the south, and the left the north
      (Job 23:9; 1 Sam. 23:19). To give the right hand was a
      pledge of fidelity (2 Kings 10:15; Ezra 10:19); also of
      submission to the victors (Ezek. 17:18; Jer. 50:15). The
      right hand was lifted up in taking an oath (Gen. 14:22,
      etc.). The hand is frequently mentioned, particularly the
      right hand, as a symbol of power and strength (Ps. 60:5;
      Isa. 28:2). To kiss the hand is an act of homage (1 Kings
      19:18; Job 31:27), and to pour water on one&#39;s hands is
      to serve him (2 Kings 3:11). The hand of God is the symbol
      of his power: its being upon one denotes favour (Ezra 7:6,
      28; Isa. 1:25; Luke 1:66, etc.) or punishment (Ex. 9:3;
      Judg. 2:15; Acts 13:11, etc.). A position at the right hand
      was regarded as the chief place of honour and power (Ps.
      45:9; 80:17; 110:1; Matt. 26:64).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001624"><b>Handbreadth -</b> a measure of four
      fingers, equal to about four inches (Ex. 25:25; 37:12; Ps.
      39:5, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001625"><b>Handkerchief -</b> Only once in
      Authorized Version (Acts 19:12). The Greek word (sudarion)
      so rendered means properly &quot;a sweat-cloth.&quot; It is
      rendered &quot;napkin&quot; in John 11:44; 20:7; Luke
      19:20.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001626"><b>Handmaid -</b> servant (Gen. 16:1;
      Ruth 3:9; Luke 1:48). It is probable that Hagar was
      Sarah&#39;s personal attendant while she was in the house
      of Pharaoh, and was among those maid-servants whom Abram
      had brought from Egypt.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001627"><b>Handwriting -</b> (Col. 2:14). The
      &quot;blotting out the handwriting&quot; is the removal by
      the grace of the gospel of the condemnation of the law
      which we had broken.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001628"><b>Hanes -</b> a place in Egypt
      mentioned only in Isa. 30:4 in connection with a reproof
      given to the Jews for trusting in Egypt. It was considered
      the same as Tahpanhes, a fortified town on the eastern
      frontier, but has been also identified as
      Ahnas-el-Medeeneh, 70 miles from Cairo.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001629"><b>Hanging -</b> (as a punishment), a
      mark of infamy inflicted on the dead bodies of criminals
      (Deut. 21:23) rather than our modern mode of punishment.
      Criminals were first strangled and then hanged (Nu. 25:4;
      Deut. 21:22). (See 2 Sam. 21:6 for the practice of the
      Gibeonites.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanging (as a curtain). (1.) Heb. masak, (a) before the
      entrance to the court of the tabernacle (Ex. 35:17); (b)
      before the door of the tabernacle (26:36, 37); (c) before
      the entrance to the most holy place, called &quot;the veil
      of the covering&quot; (35:12; 39:34), as the word properly
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. kelaim, tapestry covering the walls of the
      tabernacle (Ex. 27:9; 35:17; Num. 3:26) to the half of the
      height of the wall (Ex. 27:18; comp. 26:16). These hangings
      were fastened to pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. bottim (2 Kings 23:7), &quot;hangings for the
      grove&quot; (R.V., &quot;for the Asherah&quot;); marg.,
      instead of &quot;hangings,&quot; has &quot;tents&quot; or
      &quot;houses.&quot; Such curtained structures for
      idolatrous worship are also alluded to in Ezek. 16:16.

    <p>
      <a name="T0001630"><b>Hannah -</b> favour, grace, one of
      the wives of Elkanah the Levite, and the mother of Samuel
      (1 Sam. 1; 2). Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she
      was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle
      had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of
      sacrifices there according to the law (Ex. 23:15; 34:18;
      Deut. 16:16), probably at the feast of the Passover (comp.
      Ex. 13:10). On occasion of one of these &quot;yearly&quot;
      visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah&#39;s conduct
      toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the
      Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high
      priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed
      her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly
      condemned her conduct (1 Sam. 1:14-16). After hearing her
      explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to
      her, &quot;Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee
      thy petition.&quot; Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah
      was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family
      retired to their quiet home, and there, before another
      Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful
      memory of the Lord&#39;s goodness, she called Samuel, i.e.,
      &quot;heard of God.&quot; After the child was weaned
      (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into
      the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest,
      &quot;Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here,
      praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the
      Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
      therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as
      he liveth he is granted to the Lord&quot; (1 Sam. 1:27, 28,
      R.V.). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that
      remarkable prophetic song (2:1-10; comp. Luke 1:46-55)
      which contains the first designation of the Messiah under
      that name (1 Sam. 2:10, &quot;Annointed&quot; =
      &quot;Messiah&quot;). And so Samuel and his parents parted.
      He was left at Shiloh to minister &quot;before the
      Lord.&quot; And each year, when they came up to Shiloh,
      Hannah brought to her absent child &quot;a little
      coat&quot; (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the
      &quot;robe&quot; of the ephod worn by the high priest, Ex.
      28:31), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic (1 Chr. 15:27),
      in which to minister in the tabernacle (1 Sam. 2:19; 15:27;
      Job 2:12). &quot;And the child Samuel grew before the
      Lord.&quot; After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two
      daughters.</a>

      in Upper Mesopotamia or Padan-aram, and about 600 miles
      northwest of Ur in a direct line. It was on the caravan

      not the hoof.&quot; The habit of this animal is to grind
      its teeth and move its jaw as if it actually chewed the
      cud. But, like the cony (q.v.), it is not a ruminant with
      four stomachs, but a rodent like the squirrel, rat, etc.
      Moses speaks of it according to appearance. It is
      interdicted because, though apparently chewing the cud, it

      kedeshah</i>, i.e., a woman consecrated or devoted to
      prostitution in connection with the abominable worship of
      Asherah or Astarte, the Syrian Venus. This word is also
      used in Deut. 23:17; Hos. 4:14. Thus Tamar sat by the
      wayside as a consecrated kedeshah.</a>

    <p>
      It has been attempted to show that Rahab, usually called a
      &quot;harlot&quot; (Josh. 2:1; 6:17; Heb. 11:31; James
      2:25), was only an innkeeper. This interpretation, however,
      cannot be maintained.

    <p>
      Jephthah&#39;s mother is called a &quot;strange woman&quot;
      (Judg. 11:2). This, however, merely denotes that she was of
      foreign extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Solomon harlots appeared openly in the
      streets, and he solemnly warns against association with
      them (Prov. 7:12; 9:14. See also Jer. 3:2; Ezek. 16:24, 25,
      31). The Revised Version, following the LXX., has &quot;and
      the harlots washed,&quot; etc., instead of the rendering of
      the Authorized Version, &quot;now they washed,&quot; of 1
      Kings 22:38.

    <p>
      To commit fornication is metaphorically used for to
      practice idolatry (Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:15; Hos. throughout);
      hence Jerusalem is spoken of as a harlot (Isa. 1:21).

    <p>
      (2.) Heb. nokriyah, the &quot;strange woman&quot; (1 Kings
      11:1; Prov. 5:20; 7:5; 23:27). Those so designated were
      Canaanites and other Gentiles (Josh. 23:13). To the same
      class belonged the &quot;foolish&quot;, i.e., the sinful,
      &quot;woman.&quot;

    <p>
      In the New Testament the Greek pornai, plural,
      &quot;harlots,&quot; occurs in Matt. 21:31,32, where they
      are classed with publicans; Luke 15:30; 1 Cor. 6:15,16;
      Heb. 11:31; James 2:25. It is used symbolically in Rev.

      probably a derivative from Hebrew <i>hamesh</i> (i.e.,

      it went forth into the great battlefield of Esdraelon to

      put to flight (Judg. 4). It was situated &quot;at the
      entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of
      Acre&quot; at the base of Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is
      <i>Harosheth ha Gojim</i>, i.e., &quot;the smithy of the
      nations;&quot; probably, as is supposed, so called because
      here Jabin&#39;s iron war-chariots, armed with scythes,

      used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well
      as of praise to God (Gen. 31:27; 1 Sam. 16:23; 2 Chr.
      20:28; Ps. 33:2; 137:2).</a>

      In Solomon&#39;s time harps were made of almug-trees (1

      &quot;harps set to the Sheminith;&quot; better perhaps
      &quot;harps of eight strings.&quot; The soothing effect of
      the music of the harp is referred to 1 Sam. 16:16, 23;
      18:10; 19:9. The church in heaven is represented as

      temple porters or janitors (Ezra 2:42). He returned from
      Babylon with Zerubbabel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001673"><b>Hatred -</b> among the works of the
      flesh (Gal. 5:20). Altogether different is the meaning of
      the word in Deut. 21:15; Matt. 6:24; Luke 14:26; Rom. 9:13,
      where it denotes only a less degree of love.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001674"><b>Hattush -</b> assembled. (1.) A
      priest who returned with Zerubbabel (Neh. 12:2). (2.) Ezra
      8:2. (3.) Neh. 3:10. (4.) Neh. 10:4. (5.) 1 Chr. 3:22.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001675"><b>Hauran -</b> cave-land, mentioned
      only in Ezek. 47:16, 18. It was one of the ancient
      divisions of Bashan (q.v.), and lay on the south-east of
      Gaulanitis or the Jaulan, and on the south of Lejah,
      extending from the Arnon to the Hieromax. It was the most
      fertile region in Syria, and to this day abounds in the
      ruins of towns, many of which have stone doors and massive
      walls. It retains its ancient name. It was known by the
      Greeks and Romans as &quot;Auranitis.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001676"><b>Haven -</b> a harbour (Ps. 107:30;
      Acts 27: 12). The most famous on the coast of Palestine was
      that of Tyre (Ezek. 27:3). That of Crete, called &quot;Fair
      Havens,&quot; is mentioned Acts 27:8.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001677"><b>Havilah -</b> the sand region. (1.) A
      land mentioned in Gen. 2:11 rich in gold and bdellium and
      onyx stone. The question as to the locality of this region
      has given rise to a great diversity of opinion. It may
      perhaps be identified with the sandy tract which skirts
      Babylonia along the whole of its western border, stretching
      from the lower Euphrates to the mountains of Edom.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A district in Arabia-Felix. It is uncertain whether
      the tribe gave its name to this region or derived its name
      from it, and whether it was originally a Cushite (Gen.
      10:7) or a Joktanite tribe (10:29; comp. 25:18), or whether
      there were both a Cushite and a Joktanite Havilah. It is
      the opinion of Kalisch, however, that Havilah &quot;in both
      instances designates the same country, extending at least
      from the Persian to the Arabian Gulf, and on account of its
      vast extent easily divided into two distinct parts.&quot;
      This opinion may be well vindicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) One of the sons of Cush (Gen. 10:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A son of Joktan (Gen. 10:29; 1 Chr. 1:23).

      <a name="T0001678"><b>Havoth-jair -</b> hamlets of the
      enlightener a district in the east of Jordan. (1.) Jair,
      the son of Manasseh, took some villages of Gilead and
      called them by this name (Num. 32:41).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Again, it is said that Jair &quot;took all the tract
      of Argob,&quot; and called it Bashanhavoth-jair (Deut.
      3:14). (See also Josh. 13:30; 1 Kings 4:13; 1 Chr. 2:22,
      23.)

      <a name="T0001679"><b>Hawk -</b> (Heb. netz, a word
      expressive of strong and rapid flight, and hence
      appropriate to the hawk). It is an unclean bird (Lev.
      11:16; Deut. 14:15). It is common in Syria and surrounding
      countries. The Hebrew word includes various species of
      Falconidae, with special reference perhaps to the kestrel
      (Falco tinnunculus), the hobby (Hypotriorchis subbuteo),
      and the lesser kestrel (Tin, Cenchris). The kestrel remains
      all the year in Palestine, but some ten or twelve other
      species are all migrants from the south. Of those summer
      visitors to Palestine special mention may be made of the
      Falco sacer and the Falco lanarius. (See NIGHT-HAWK
      &macr;T0002729.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001680"><b>Hay -</b> properly so called, was not
      in use among the Hebrews; straw was used instead. They cut
      the grass green as it was needed. The word rendered
      &quot;hay&quot; in Prov. 27:25 means the first shoots of
      the grass. In Isa. 15:6 the Revised Version has correctly
      &quot;grass,&quot; where the Authorized Version has
      &quot;hay.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0001681"><b>Hazael -</b> whom God beholds, an
      officer of Ben-hadad II., king of Syria, who ultimately
      came to the throne, according to the word of the Lord to
      Elijah (1 Kings 19:15), after he had put the king to death
      (2 Kings 8:15). His interview with Elisha is mentioned in 2
      Kings 8. The Assyrians soon after his accession to the
      throne came against him and defeated him with very great
      loss; and three years afterwards again invaded Syria, but
      on this occasion Hazael submitted to them. He then turned
      his arms against Israel, and ravaged &quot;all the land of
      Gilead,&quot; etc. (2 Kings 10:33), which he held in a
      degree of subjection to him (13:3-7, 22). He aimed at the
      subjugation also of the kingdom of Judah, when Joash
      obtained peace by giving him &quot;all the gold that was
      found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the
      king&#39;s house&quot; (2 Kings 12:18; 2 Chr. 24:24). He
      reigned about forty-six years (B.C.886-840), and was
      succeeded on the throne by his son Ben-hadad (2 Kings
      13:22-25), who on several occasions was defeated by
      Jehoash, the king of Israel, and compelled to restore all
      the land of Israel his father had taken.</a>

      place in the southern boundary of Palestine (Num. 34:4), in
      the desert to the west of Kadesh-barnea. It is called Adar
      in Josh. 15:3.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001683"><b>Hazar-enan -</b> village of
      fountains, a place on the north-east frontier of Palestine
      (Num. 34:9, 10). Some have identified it with Ayan ed-Dara
      in the heart of the central chain of Anti-Libanus. More
      probably, however, it has been identified with Kuryetein,
      about 60 miles east-north-east of Damascus. (Comp. Ezek.
      47:17; 48:1.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001686"><b>Hazar-maveth -</b> court of death,
      the third son of Joktan, and a region in Arabia-Felix
      settled by him (Gen. 10:26; 1 Chr. 1:20). It is probably
      the modern province of Hadramaut, situated on the Indian
      Ocean east of the modern Yemen.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001687"><b>Hazar-shual -</b> village or
      enclosure of the jackal, a city on the south border of
      Judah (Josh. 15:28; Neh. 11:27). It has been identified
      with the ruins of Saweh, half-way between Beersheba and
      Moladah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001688"><b>Hazar-susah -</b> village of the
      horse, the same as Sansannah, one of Solomon&#39;s
      &quot;chariot cities&quot; (Josh. 15:31; 2 Chr. 1:14), a
      depot in the south border of Judah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001689"><b>Hazel -</b> Heb. luz, (Gen. 30:37), a
      nutbearing tree. The Hebrew word is rendered in the Vulgate
      by amygdalinus, &quot;the almond-tree,&quot; which is
      probably correct. That tree flourishes in Syria.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001690"><b>Hazerim -</b> villages, probably the
      name of the temporary villages in which the nomad Avites
      resided (Deut. 2:23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001691"><b>Hazeroth -</b> fenced enclosures
      consisting of &quot;a low wall of stones in which thick
      bundles of thorny acacia are inserted, the tangled branches
      and long needle-like spikes forming a perfectly
      impenetrable hedge around the encampment&quot; of tents and
      cattle which they sheltered. Such like enclosures abound in
      the wilderness of Paran, which the Israelites entered after
      leaving Sinai (Num. 11:35; 12:16; 33:17, 18). This third
      encampment of the Israelites has been identified with the
      modern &#39;Ain el-Hudhera, some 40 miles north-east of
      Sinai. Here Miriam (q.v.), being displeased that Moses had
      married a Cushite wife (Num. 12:1), induced Aaron to join
      with her in rebelling against Moses. God vindicated the
      authority of his &quot;servant Moses,&quot; and Miriam was
      smitten with leprosy. Moses interceded for her, and she was
      healed (Num. 12:4-16). From this encampment the Israelites
      marched northward across the plateau of et-Tih, and at
      length reached KADESH.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001692"><b>Hazezon-tamar -</b> pruning of the
      palm, the original name of the place afterwards called
      ENGEDI (q.v.), Gen. 14:7; called also HAZAZON-TAMAR (2 Chr.
      20:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001693"><b>Hazo -</b> vision, one of the sons of
      Nahor (Gen. 22:22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001694"><b>Hazor -</b> enclosed; fortified. (1.)
      A stronghold of the Canaanites in the mountains north of
      Lake Merom (Josh. 11:1-5). Jabin the king with his allied
      tribes here encountered Joshua in a great battle. Joshua
      gained a signal victory, which virtually completed his
      conquest of Canaan (11:10-13). This city was, however,
      afterwards rebuilt by the Canaanites, and was ruled by a
      king with the same hereditary name of Jabin. His army,
      under a noted leader of the name of Sisera, swept down upon
      the south, aiming at the complete subjugation of the
      country. This powerful army was met by the Israelites under
      Barak, who went forth by the advice of the prophetess
      Deborah. The result was one of the most remarkable
      victories for Israel recorded in the Old Testament (Josh.
      19:36; Judg. 4:2; 1 Sam. 12:9). The city of Hazor was taken
      and occupied by the Israelites. It was fortified by Solomon
      to defend the entrance into the kingdom from Syria and
      Assyria. When Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, invaded
      the land, this was one of the first cities he captured,
      carrying its inhabitants captive into Assyria (2 Kings
      15:29). It has been identified with Khurbet Harrah, 2 1/2
      miles south-east of Kedesh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A city in the south of Judah (Josh. 15:23). The name
      here should probably be connected with the word following,
      Ithnan, HAZOR-ITHNAN instead of &quot;Hazor and
      Ithnan.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A district in Arabia (Jer. 49:28-33), supposed by some
      to be Jetor, i.e., Ituraea.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) &quot;Kerioth and Hezron&quot; (Josh. 15: 25) should
      be &quot;Kerioth-hezron&quot; (as in the R.V.), the two
      names being joined together as the name of one place (e.g.,
      like Kirjath-jearim), &quot;the same is Hazor&quot; (R.V.).
      This place has been identified with el-Kuryetein, and has
      been supposed to be the home of Judas Iscariot. (See <a

    <p>
      <a name="T0001695"><b>Hazor-hadattah -</b> New Hazor, a
      city in the south of Judah (Josh. 15:25). It is probably
      identified with the ruins of el-Hazzarah, near Beit
      Jebrin.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001696"><b>Head-bands -</b> (Heb. kishshurim),
      properly girdles or belts for the waist (Isa. 3:20, R.V.,
      &quot;sashes;&quot; Jer. 2:32, rendered &quot;attire&quot;,
      i.e., a girdle round the waist).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001697"><b>Head-dress -</b> Not in common use
      among the Hebrews. It is first mentioned in Ex. 28:40
      (A.V., &quot;bonnets;&quot; R.V., &quot;head-tires&quot;).
      It was used especially for purposes of ornament (Job 29:14;
      Isa. 3:23; 62:3). The Hebrew word here used, <i>
      tsaniph</i>, properly means a turban, folds of linen wound
      round the head. The Hebrew word <i>peer</i>, used in Isa.
      61:3, there rendered &quot;beauty&quot; (A.V.) and
      &quot;garland&quot; (R.V.), is a head-dress or turban worn
      by females (Isa. 3: 20, &quot;bonnets&quot;), priests (Ex.
      39:28), a bridegroom (Isa. 61:10, &quot;ornament;&quot;
      R.V., &quot;garland&quot;). Ezek. 16:10 and Jonah 2:5 are
      to be understood of the turban wrapped round the head. The
      Hebrew <i>shebisim</i> (Isa. 3:18), in the Authorized
      Version rendered &quot;cauls,&quot; and marg.
      &quot;networks,&quot; denotes probably a kind of netted
      head-dress. The &quot;horn&quot; (Heb. keren) mentioned in
      1 Sam. 2:1 is the head-dress called by the Druses of Mount
      Lebanon the tantura.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001698"><b>Heap -</b> When Joshua took the city
      of Ai (Josh. 8), he burned it and &quot;made it an heap
      [Heb. tel] for ever&quot; (8:28). The ruins of this city
      were for a long time sought for in vain. It has been at
      length, however, identified with the mound which simply
      bears the name of &quot;Tel.&quot; &quot;There are many
      Tels in modern Palestine, that land of Tels, each Tel with
      some other name attached to it to mark the former site. But
      the site of Ai has no other name &#39;unto this day.&#39;
      It is simply et-Tel, &#39;the heap&#39; par
      excellence.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001699"><b>Heart -</b> According to the Bible,
      the heart is the centre not only of spiritual activity, but
      of all the operations of human life. &quot;Heart&quot; and
      &quot;soul&quot; are often used interchangeably (Deut. 6:5;
      26:16; comp. Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30, 33), but this is not
      generally the case.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart is the &quot;home of the personal life,&quot; and
      hence a man is designated, according to his heart, wise (1
      Kings 3:12, etc.), pure (Ps. 24:4; Matt. 5:8, etc.),
      upright and righteous (Gen. 20:5, 6; Ps. 11:2; 78:72),
      pious and good (Luke 8:15), etc. In these and such passages
      the word &quot;soul&quot; could not be substituted for
      &quot;heart.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart is also the seat of the conscience (Rom. 2:15).
      It is naturally wicked (Gen. 8:21), and hence it
      contaminates the whole life and character (Matt. 12:34;
      15:18; comp. Eccl. 8:11; Ps. 73:7). Hence the heart must be
      changed, regenerated (Ezek. 36:26; 11:19; Ps. 51:10-14),
      before a man can willingly obey God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of salvation begins in the heart by the
      believing reception of the testimony of God, while the
      rejection of that testimony hardens the heart (Ps. 95:8;
      Prov. 28:14; 2 Chr. 36:13). &quot;Hardness of heart
      evidences itself by light views of sin; partial
      acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and conceit;
      ingratitude; unconcern about the word and ordinances of
      God; inattention to divine providences; stifling
      convictions of conscience; shunning reproof; presumption,
      and general ignorance of divine things.&quot;
