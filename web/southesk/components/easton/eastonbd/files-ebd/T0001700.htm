      <a name="T0001702"><b>Heath -</b> Heb. &#39;arar, (Jer.
      17:6; 48:6), a species of juniper called by the Arabs by
      the same name (&#39;arar), the Juniperus sabina or savin.
      &quot;Its gloomy, stunted appearance, with its scale-like
      leaves pressed close to its gnarled stem, and cropped close
      by the wild goats, as it clings to the rocks about Petra,
      gives great force to the contrast suggested by the prophet,
      between him that trusteth in man, naked and destitute, and
      the man that trusteth in the Lord, flourishing as a tree
      planted by the waters&quot; (Tristram, Natural History of
      the Bible).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001703"><b>Heathen -</b> (Heb. plural goyum). At
      first the word <i>goyim</i> denoted generally all the
      nations of the world (Gen. 18:18; comp. Gal. 3:8). The Jews
      afterwards became a people distinguished in a marked manner
      from the other <i>goyim</i>. They were a separate people
      (Lev. 20:23; 26:14-45; Deut. 28), and the other nations,
      the Amorites, Hittites, etc., were the <i>goyim</i>, the
      heathen, with whom the Jews were forbidden to be associated
      in any way (Josh. 23:7; 1 Kings 11:2). The practice of
      idolatry was the characteristic of these nations, and hence
      the word came to designate idolaters (Ps. 106:47; Jer.
      46:28; Lam. 1:3; Isa. 36:18), the wicked (Ps. 9:5, 15,
      17).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The corresponding Greek word in the New Testament, <i>
      ethne</i>, has similar shades of meaning. In Acts 22:21,
      Gal. 3:14, it denotes the people of the earth generally;
      and in Matt. 6:7, an idolater. In modern usage the word
      denotes all nations that are strangers to revealed
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001704"><b>Heaven -</b> (1.) Definitions. The
      phrase &quot;heaven and earth&quot; is used to indicate the
      whole universe (Gen. 1:1; Jer. 23:24; Acts 17:24).
      According to the Jewish notion there were three
      heavens,</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The firmament, as &quot;fowls of the heaven&quot; (Gen.
      2:19; 7:3, 23; Ps. 8:8, etc.), &quot;the eagles of
      heaven&quot; (Lam. 4:19), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The starry heavens (Deut. 17:3; Jer. 8:2; Matt. 24:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) &quot;The heaven of heavens,&quot; or &quot;the third
      heaven&quot; (Deut. 10:14; 1 Kings 8:27; Ps. 115:16; 148:4;
      2 Cor. 12:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Meaning of words in the original,
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The usual Hebrew word for &quot;heavens&quot; is <i>
      shamayim</i>, a plural form meaning &quot;heights,&quot;
      &quot;elevations&quot; (Gen. 1:1; 2:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The Hebrew word <i>marom</i> is also used (Ps. 68:18;
      93:4; 102:19, etc.) as equivalent to <i>shamayim</i>,
      &quot;high places,&quot; &quot;heights.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Heb. galgal, literally a &quot;wheel,&quot; is rendered
      &quot;heaven&quot; in Ps. 77:18 (R.V.,
      &quot;whirlwind&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Heb. shahak, rendered &quot;sky&quot; (Deut. 33:26; Job
      37:18; Ps. 18:11), plural &quot;clouds&quot; (Job 35:5;
      36:28; Ps. 68:34, marg. &quot;heavens&quot;), means
      probably the firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Heb. rakia is closely connected with (d), and is
      rendered &quot;firmamentum&quot; in the Vulgate, whence our
      &quot;firmament&quot; (Gen. 1:6; Deut. 33:26, etc.),
      regarded as a solid expanse.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Metaphorical meaning of term. Isa. 14:13, 14;
      &quot;doors of heaven&quot; (Ps. 78:23); heaven
      &quot;shut&quot; (1 Kings 8:35); &quot;opened&quot; (Ezek.
      1:1). (See 1 Chr. 21:16.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Spiritual meaning. The place of the everlasting
      blessedness of the righteous; the abode of departed
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) Christ calls it his &quot;Father&#39;s house&quot;
      (John 14:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) It is called &quot;paradise&quot; (Luke 23:43; 2 Cor.
      12:4; Rev. 2:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) &quot;The heavenly Jerusalem&quot; (Gal. 4: 26; Heb.
      12:22; Rev. 3:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; (Matt. 25:1; James
      2:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) The &quot;eternal kingdom&quot; (2 Pet. 1:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) The &quot;eternal inheritance&quot; (1 Pet. 1:4; Heb.
      9:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (g) The &quot;better country&quot; (Heb. 11:14, 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (h) The blessed are said to &quot;sit down with Abraham,
      Isaac, and Jacob,&quot; and to be &quot;in Abraham&#39;s
      bosom&quot; (Luke 16:22; Matt. 8:11); to &quot;reign with
      Christ&quot; (2 Tim. 2:12); and to enjoy &quot;rest&quot;
      (Heb. 4:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      In heaven the blessedness of the righteous consists in the
      possession of &quot;life everlasting,&quot; &quot;an
      eternal weight of glory&quot; (2 Cor. 4:17), an exemption
      from all sufferings for ever, a deliverance from all evils
      (2 Cor. 5:1, 2) and from the society of the wicked (2 Tim.
      4:18), bliss without termination, the &quot;fulness of
      joy&quot; for ever (Luke 20:36; 2 Cor. 4:16, 18; 1 Pet.
      1:4; 5:10; 1 John 3:2). The believer&#39;s heaven is not
      only a state of everlasting blessedness, but also a
      &quot;place&quot;, a place &quot;prepared&quot; for them
      (John 14:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001705"><b>Heave offering -</b> Heb. terumah,
      (Ex. 29:27) means simply an offering, a present, including
      all the offerings made by the Israelites as a present. This
      Hebrew word is frequently employed. Some of the rabbis
      attach to the word the meaning of elevation, and refer it
      to the heave offering, which consisted in presenting the
      offering by a motion up and down, distinguished from the
      wave offering, which consisted in a repeated movement in a
      horizontal direction, a &quot;wave offering to the Lord as
      ruler of earth, a heave offering to the Lord as ruler of
      heaven.&quot; The right shoulder, which fell to the priests
      in presenting thank offerings, was called the heave
      shoulder (Lev. 7:34; Num. 6:20). The first fruits offered
      in harvest-time (Num. 15:20, 21) were heave offerings.</a>

      <a name="T0001706"><b>Heber -</b> passing over. (1.) Son of
      Beriah and grandson of Asher (Gen. 46:17; 1 Chr. 7:31,
      32).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The Kenite (Judg. 4:11, 17; 5:24), a descendant of
      Hobab. His wife Jael received Sisera (q.v.) into her tent
      and then killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) 1 Chr. 4:18.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A Benjamite (1 Chr. 8:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) A Gadite (5:13). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001100.html&amp;from=T0001119&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      EBER</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001707"><b>Hebrew -</b> a name applied to the
      Israelites in Scripture only by one who is a foreigner
      (Gen. 39:14, 17; 41:12, etc.), or by the Israelites when
      they speak of themselves to foreigners (40:15; Ex. 1:19),
      or when spoken of an contrasted with other peoples (Gen.
      43:32; Ex. 1:3, 7, 15; Deut. 15:12). In the New Testament
      there is the same contrast between Hebrews and foreigners
      (Acts 6:1; Phil. 3:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Derivation. (1.) The name is derived, according to some,
      from Eber (Gen. 10:24), the ancestor of Abraham. The
      Hebrews are &quot;sons of Eber&quot; (10:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Others trace the name of a Hebrew root-word signifying
      &quot;to pass over,&quot; and hence regard it as meaning
      &quot;the man who passed over,&quot; viz., the Euphrates;
      or to the Hebrew word meaning &quot;the region&quot; or
      &quot;country beyond,&quot; viz., the land of Chaldea. This
      latter view is preferred. It is the more probable origin of
      the designation given to Abraham coming among the
      Canaanites as a man from beyond the Euphrates (Gen. 14:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A third derivation of the word has been suggested,
      viz., that it is from the Hebrew word <i>&#39;abhar</i>,
      &quot;to pass over,&quot; whence <i>&#39;ebher</i>, in the
      sense of a &quot;sojourner&quot; or &quot;passer
      through&quot; as distinct from a &quot;settler&quot; in the
      land, and thus applies to the condition of Abraham (Heb.
      11:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001708"><b>Hebrew language -</b> the language of
      the Hebrew nation, and that in which the Old Testament is
      written, with the exception of a few portions in Chaldee.
      In the Old Testament it is only spoken of as
      &quot;Jewish&quot; (2 Kings 18:26, 28; Isa. 36:11, 13; 2
      Chr 32:18). This name is first used by the Jews in times
      subsequent to the close of the Old Testament.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the class of languages called Semitic, because
      they were chiefly spoken among the descendants of Shem.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Abraham entered Canaan it is obvious that he found the
      language of its inhabitants closely allied to his own.
      Isaiah (19:18) calls it &quot;the language of Canaan.&quot;
      Whether this language, as seen in the earliest books of the
      Old Testament, was the very dialect which Abraham brought
      with him into Canaan, or whether it was the common tongue
      of the Canaanitish nations which he only adopted, is
      uncertain; probably the latter opinion is the correct one.
      For the thousand years between Moses and the Babylonian
      exile the Hebrew language underwent little or no
      modification. It preserves all through a remarkable
      uniformity of structure. From the first it appears in its
      full maturity of development. But through intercourse with
      Damascus, Assyria, and Babylon, from the time of David, and
      more particularly from the period of the Exile, it comes
      under the influence of the Aramaic idiom, and this is seen
      in the writings which date from this period. It was never
      spoken in its purity by the Jews after their return from
      Babylon. They now spoke Hebrew with a large admixture of
      Aramaic or Chaldee, which latterly became the predominant
      element in the national language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew of the Old Testament has only about six thousand
      words, all derived from about five hundred roots. Hence the
      same word has sometimes a great variety of meanings. So
      long as it was a living language, and for ages after, only
      the consonants of the words were written. This also has
      been a source of difficulty in interpreting certain words,
      for the meaning varies according to the vowels which may be
      supplied. The Hebrew is one of the oldest languages of
      which we have any knowledge. It is essentially identical
      with the Phoenician language. (See MOABITE <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002500.html&amp;from=T0002586&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      STONE</a>.) The Semitic languages, to which class the
      Hebrew and Phoenician belonged, were spoken over a very
      wide area: in Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and
      Arabia, in all the countries from the Mediterranean to the
      borders of Assyria, and from the mountains of Armenia to
      the Indian Ocean. The rounded form of the letters, as seen
      in the Moabite stone, was probably that in which the
      ancient Hebrew was written down to the time of the Exile,
      when the present square or Chaldean form was adopted.

      GREEKS</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001711"><b>Hebrews, Epistle to -</b> (1.) Its
      canonicity. All the results of critical and historical
      research to which this epistle has been specially subjected
      abundantly vindicate its right to a place in the New
      Testament canon among the other inspired books.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Its authorship. A considerable variety of opinions on
      this subject has at different times been advanced. Some
      have maintained that its author was Silas, Paul&#39;s
      companion. Others have attributed it to Clement of Rome, or
      Luke, or Barnabas, or some unknown Alexandrian Christian,
      or Apollos; but the conclusion which we think is best
      supported, both from internal and external evidence, is
      that Paul was its author. There are, no doubt, many
      difficulties in the way of accepting it as Paul&#39;s; but
      we may at least argue with Calvin that there can be no
      difficulty in the way of &quot;embracing it without
      controversy as one of the apostolical epistles.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Date and place of writing. It was in all probability
      written at Rome, near the close of Paul&#39;s two
      years&#39; imprisonment (Heb. 13:19,24). It was certainly
      written before the destruction of Jerusalem (13:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) To whom addressed. Plainly it was intended for Jewish
      converts to the faith of the gospel, probably for the
      church at Jerusalem. The subscription of this epistle is,
      of course, without authority. In this case it is incorrect,
      for obviously Timothy could not be the bearer of it
      (13:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Its design was to show the true end and meaning of the
      Mosaic system, and its symbolical and transient character.
      It proves that the Levitical priesthood was a
      &quot;shadow&quot; of that of Christ, and that the legal
      sacrifices prefigured the great and all-perfect sacrifice
      he offered for us. It explains that the gospel was
      designed, not to modify the law of Moses, but to supersede
      and abolish it. Its teaching was fitted, as it was
      designed, to check that tendency to apostatize from
      Christianity and to return to Judaism which now showed
      itself among certain Jewish Christians. The supreme
      authority and the transcendent glory of the gospel are
      clearly set forth, and in such a way as to strengthen and
      confirm their allegiance to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) It consists of two parts: (a) doctrinal (1-10:18), (b)
      and practical (10:19-ch. 13). There are found in it many
      references to portions of the Old Testament. It may be
      regarded as a treatise supplementary to the Epistles to the
      Romans and Galatians, and as an inspired commentary on the
      book of Leviticus.

      (1.) A city in the south end of the valley of Eshcol, about
      midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba, from which it is
      distant about 20 miles in a straight line. It was built
      &quot;seven years before Zoan in Egypt&quot; (Gen. 13:18;
      Num. 13:22). It still exists under the same name, and is
      one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier
      name was Kirjath-arba (Gen. 23:2; Josh. 14:15; 15:3). But
      &quot;Hebron would appear to have been the original name of
      the city, and it was not till after Abraham&#39;s stay
      there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e.,
      Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city,
      having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he
      belonged. It retained this name till it came into the
      possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the
      original name Hebron&quot; (Keil, Com.). The name of this
      city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New
      Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was
      the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent
      under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards
      to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the
      cave of Machpelah (Gen. 23:17-20), which he bought from
      Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed
      for Egypt by way of Beersheba (37:14; 46:1). It was taken
      by Joshua and given to Caleb (Josh. 10:36, 37; 12:10;
      14:13). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge
      (20:7; 21:11). When David became king of Judah this was his
      royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half
      years (2 Sam. 5:5); and here he was anointed as king over
      all Israel (2 Sam. 2:1-4, 11; 1 Kings 2:11). It became the
      residence also of the rebellious Absalom (2 Sam. 15:10),
      who probably expected to find his chief support in the
      tribe of Judah, now called el-Khulil.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In one part of the modern city is a great mosque, which is
      built over the grave of Machpelah. The first European who
      was permitted to enter this mosque was the Prince of Wales
      in 1862. It was also visited by the Marquis of Bute in
      1866, and by the late Emperor Frederick of Germany (then
      Crown-Prince of Prussia) in 1869.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the largest oaks in Palestine is found in the valley
      of Eshcol, about 3 miles north of the town. It is supposed
      by some to be the tree under which Abraham pitched his
      tent, and is called &quot;Abraham&#39;s oak.&quot; (See <a

      specific regulations regarding the transmission of real
      property, which are given in detail in Deut. 21:17; Num.
      27:8; 36:6; 27:9-11. Succession to property was a matter of
      right and not of favour. Christ is the &quot;heir of all
      things&quot; (Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:15). Believers are heirs of

      the battle of Gilboa, so fatal to Saul and his house,
      David, as divinely directed, took up his residence in
      Hebron, and was there anointed king over Judah. Among the
      fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only surviving
      son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul&#39;s uncle, took across the
      Jordan to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king.
      Abner gathered all the forces at his command and marched to
      Gibeon, with the object of wresting Judah from David. Joab
      had the command of David&#39;s army of trained men, who
      encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of
      the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while
      Abner&#39;s army lay on the north of the pool. Abner
      proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve
      young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So
      fiercely did they encounter each other that &quot;they
      caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his
      sword in his fellow&#39;s side; so they fell down together:
      wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim.&quot; The
      combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there
      followed a severe general engagement between the two
      armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under
      Abner. The general result of this battle was that
      &quot;David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of
      Saul waxed weaker and weaker&quot; (2 Sam. 3:1). (See <a

    <p>
      <a name="T0001731"><b>Hell -</b> derived from the Saxon
      helan, to cover; hence the covered or the invisible place.
      In Scripture there are three words so rendered:</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament sixty-five
      times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning
      &quot;to ask,&quot; &quot;demand;&quot; hence
      insatiableness (Prov. 30:15, 16). It is rendered
      &quot;grave&quot; thirty-one times (Gen. 37:35; 42:38;
      44:29, 31; 1 Sam. 2:6, etc.). The Revisers have retained
      this rendering in the historical books with the original
      word in the margin, while in the poetical books they have
      reversed this rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      In thirty-one cases in the Authorized Version this word is
      rendered &quot;hell,&quot; the place of disembodied
      spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are &quot;the
      congregation of the dead&quot; (Prov. 21:16). It is (a) the
      abode of the wicked (Num. 16:33; Job 24:19; Ps. 9:17;
      31:17, etc.); (b) of the good (Ps. 16:10; 30:3; 49:15;
      86:13, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheol is described as deep (Job 11:8), dark (10:21, 22),
      with bars (17:16). The dead &quot;go down&quot; to it (Num.
      16:30, 33; Ezek. 31:15, 16, 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The Greek word hades of the New Testament has the same
      scope of signification as sheol of the Old Testament. It is
      a prison (1 Pet. 3:19), with gates and bars and locks
      (Matt. 16:18; Rev. 1:18), and it is downward (Matt. 11:23;
      Luke 10:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The righteous and the wicked are separated. The blessed
      dead are in that part of hades called paradise (Luke
      23:43). They are also said to be in Abraham&#39;s bosom
      (Luke 16:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Gehenna, in most of its occurrences in the Greek New
      Testament, designates the place of the lost (Matt. 23:33).
      The fearful nature of their condition there is described in
      various figurative expressions (Matt. 8:12; 13:42; 22:13;
      25:30; Luke 16:24, etc.). (See <a href=

      because of the regulations in Num. 15:38, 39. These borders

      attract special notice (Matt. 23:5). The hem of

      &quot;venom,&quot; Deut. 32:33). &quot;Rosh is the name of
      some poisonous plant which grows quickly and luxuriantly;
      of a bitter taste, and therefore coupled with wormwood
      (Deut. 29:18; Lam. 3:19). Hence it would seem to be not the

      &quot;hemlock&quot; (Amos 6:12; R.V.,

      probably of the lowest caste. Some of Joseph&#39;s brethren
      were made rulers over Pharaoh&#39;s cattle (Gen. 47:6, 17).
      The Israelites were known in Egypt as &quot;keepers of
      cattle;&quot; and when they left it they took their flocks
      and herds with them (Ex. 12:38). Both David and Saul came
      from &quot;following the herd&quot; to occupy the throne (1
      Sam. 9; 11:5; Ps. 78:70). David&#39;s herd-masters were
      among his chief officers of state. The daughters also of
      wealthy chiefs were wont to tend the flocks of the family
      (Gen. 29:9; Ex. 2:16). The &quot;chief of the
      herdsmen&quot; was in the time of the monarchy an officer
      of high rank (1 Sam. 21:7; comp. 1 Chr. 27:29). The
      herdsmen lived in tents (Isa. 38:12; Jer. 6:3); and there
      were folds for the cattle (Num. 32:16), and watch-towers
      for the herdsmen, that he might therefrom observe any
      coming danger (Micah 4:8; Nah. 3:8).</a>

      <a name="T0001750"><b>Heresy -</b> from a Greek word
      signifying (1) a choice, (2) the opinion chosen, and (3)
      the sect holding the opinion. In the Acts of the Apostles
      (5:17; 15:5; 24:5, 14; 26:5) it denotes a sect, without
      reference to its character. Elsewhere, however, in the New
      Testament it has a different meaning attached to it. Paul
      ranks &quot;heresies&quot; with crimes and seditions (Gal.
      5:20). This word also denotes divisions or schisms in the
      church (1 Cor. 11:19). In Titus 3:10 a &quot;heretical
      person&quot; is one who follows his own self-willed
      &quot;questions,&quot; and who is to be avoided. Heresies
      thus came to signify self-chosen doctrines not emanating
      from God (2 Pet. 2:1).</a>

      prolongation of the Anti-Lebanon range, reaching to the
      height of about 9,200 feet above the Mediterranean. It
      marks the north boundary of Palestine (Deut. 3:8, 4:48;
      Josh. 11:3, 17; 13:11; 12:1), and is seen from a great
      distance. It is about 40 miles north of the Sea of Galilee.
      It is called &quot;the Hermonites&quot; (Ps. 42:6) because
      it has more than one summit. The Sidonians called it
      Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir (Deut. 3:9; Cant. 4:8). It
      is also called Baal-hermon (Judg. 3:3; 1 Chr. 5:23) and
      Sion (Deut. 4:48). There is every probability that one of
      its three summits was the scene of the transfiguration
      (q.v.). The &quot;dew of Hermon&quot; is referred to (Ps.
      89: 12). Its modern name is Jebel-esh-Sheikh, &quot;the
      chief mountain.&quot; It is one of the most conspicuous
      mountains in Palestine or Syria. &quot;In whatever part of
      Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon
      was there, terminating the view. From the plain along the
      coast, from the Jordan valley, from the heights of Moab and
      Gilead, from the plateau of Bashan, the pale, blue,
      snow-capped cone forms the one feature in the northern
      horizon.&quot;</a>

      Our Lord and his disciples climbed this &quot;high mountain
      apart&quot; one day, and remained on its summit all night,
      &quot;weary after their long and toilsome ascent.&quot;
      During the night &quot;he was transfigured before them; and
      his face did shine as the sun.&quot; The next day they
      descended to Caesarea Philippi.

      Lysanias II., and ultimately possessed the entire kingdom
      of his grandfather, Herod the Great, with the title of
      king. He put the apostle James the elder to death, and cast
      Peter into prison (Luke 3:1; Acts 12:1-19). On the second
      day of a festival held in honour of the emperor Claudius,
      he appeared in the great theatre of Caesarea. &quot;The
      king came in clothed in magnificent robes, of which silver
      was the costly brilliant material. It was early in the day,
      and the sun&#39;s rays fell on the king, so that the eyes
      of the beholders were dazzled with the brightness which
      surrounded him. Voices here and there from the crowd
      exclaimed that it was the apparition of something divine.
      And when he spoke and made an oration to them, they gave a
      shout, saying, &#39;It is the voice of a god, and not of a
      man.&#39; But in the midst of this idolatrous ostentation
      an angel of God suddenly smote him. He was carried out of
      the theatre a dying man.&quot; He died (A.D. 44) of the
      same loathsome malady which slew his grandfather (Acts.
      12:21-23), in the fifty-fourth year of his age, having
      reigned four years as tetrarch and three as king over the
      whole of Palestine. After his death his kingdom came under
      the control of the prefect of Syria, and Palestine was now

      47 Julius Caesar made Antipater, a &quot;wily
      Idumaean,&quot; procurator of Judea, who divided his
      territories between his four sons, Galilee falling to the

      old and under&quot; (Matt. 2:16). He was fond of splendour,
      and lavished great sums in rebuilding and adorning the
      cities of his empire. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea
      (q.v.) on the coast, and also the city of Samaria (q.v.),
      which he called Sebaste, in honour of Augustus. He restored
      the ruined temple of Jerusalem, a work which was begun B.C.
      20, but was not finished till after Herod&#39;s death,
      probably not till about A.D. 50 (John 2:20). After a

      reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of
      this king is contained in 2 Kings 18:20, Isa. 36-39, and 2
      Chr. 29-32. He is spoken of as a great and good king. In
      public life he followed the example of his great-granfather
      Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his
      kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end,
      he destroyed the &quot;brazen serpent,&quot; which had been
      removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of
      idolatrous worship (Num. 21:9). A great reformation was
      wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day (2 Kings 18:4; 2
      Chr. 29:3-36).</a>

    <p>
      On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son
      Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to
      pay the tribute which his father had paid, and
      &quot;rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him
      not,&quot; but entered into a league with Egypt (Isa. 30;
      31; 36:6-9). This led to the invasion of Judah by
      Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:13-16), who took forty cities, and
      besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the
      demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three
      hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold (18:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah (Isa.
      33:1), and a second time within two years invaded his
      kingdom (2 Kings 18:17; 2 Chr. 32:9; Isa. 36). This
      invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib&#39;s
      army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and &quot;that night the
      angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the
      Assyrians 185,000 men.&quot; Sennacherib fled with the
      shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where,
      seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons
      Adrammelech and Sharezer (2 Kings 19:37). (See <a href=

      Various ambassadors came to congratulate him on his
      recovery, and among them Merodach-baladan, the viceroy of
      Babylon (2 Chr. 32:23; 2 Kings 20:12). He closed his days
      in peace and prosperity, and was succeeded by his son
      Manasseh. He was buried in the &quot;chiefest of the
      sepulchres of the sons of David&quot; (2 Chr. 32:27-33). He

      of Phrygia, where was a Christian church under the care of
      Epaphras (Col. 4:12, 13). This church was founded at the
      same time as that of Colosse. It now bears the name of
      Pambuk-Kalek, i.e., &quot;Cotton Castle&quot;, from the
      white appearance of the cliffs at the base of which the
      ruins are found.</a>

      <a name="T0001780"><b>Higgaion -</b> in Ps. 92:3 means the
      murmuring tone of the harp. In Ps. 9:16 it is a musical
      sign, denoting probably a pause in the instrumental
      interlude. In Ps. 19:14 the word is rendered
      &quot;meditation;&quot; and in Lam. 3:62,
      &quot;device&quot; (R.V., &quot;imagination&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001781"><b>High place -</b> an eminence, natural
      or artificial, where worship by sacrifice or offerings was
      made (1 Kings 13:32; 2 Kings 17:29). The first altar after
      the Flood was built on a mountain (Gen. 8:20). Abraham also
      built an altar on a mountain (12:7, 8). It was on a
      mountain in Gilead that Laban and Jacob offered sacrifices
      (31:54). After the Israelites entered the Promised Land
      they were strictly enjoined to overthrow the high places of
      the Canaanites (Ex. 34:13; Deut. 7:5; 12:2, 3), and they
      were forbidden to worship the Lord on high places (Deut.
      12:11-14), and were enjoined to use but one altar for
      sacrifices (Lev. 17:3, 4; Deut. 12; 16:21). The injunction
      against high places was, however, very imperfectly obeyed,
      and we find again and again mention made of them (2 Kings
      14:4; 15:4, 35:2 Chr. 15:17, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001782"><b>High priest -</b> Aaron was the first
      who was solemnly set apart to this office (Ex. 29:7; 30:23;
      Lev. 8:12). He wore a peculiar dress, which on his death
      passed to his successor in office (Ex. 29:29, 30). Besides
      those garments which he wore in common with all priests,
      there were four that were peculiar to himself as high
      priest:</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The &quot;robe&quot; of the ephod, all of blue, of
      &quot;woven work,&quot; worn immediately under the ephod.
      It was without seam or sleeves. The hem or skirt was
      ornamented with pomegranates and golden bells, seventy-two
      of each in alternate order. The sounding of the bells
      intimated to the people in the outer court the time when
      the high priest entered into the holy place to burn incense
      before the Lord (Ex. 28).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The &quot;ephod&quot; consisted of two parts, one of
      which covered the back and the other the breast, which were
      united by the &quot;curious girdle.&quot; It was made of
      fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple.
      Each of the shoulder-straps was adorned with a precious
      stone, on which the names of the twelve tribes were
      engraved. This was the high priest&#39;s distinctive
      vestment (1 Sam. 2:28; 14:3; 21:9; 23:6, 9; 30:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The &quot;breastplate of judgment&quot; (Ex. 28:6-12,
      25-28; 39:2-7) of &quot;cunning work.&quot; It was a piece
      of cloth doubled, of one span square. It bore twelve
      precious stones, set in four rows of three in a row, which
      constituted the Urim and Thummim (q.v.). These stones had
      the names of the twelve tribes engraved on them. When the
      high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate,
      inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious
      way by the Urim and Thummim (1 Sam. 14:3, 18, 19; 23:2, 4,
      9, 11,12; 28:6; 2 Sam. 5:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The &quot;mitre,&quot; or upper turban, a twisted band
      of eight yards of fine linen coiled into a cap, with a gold
      plate in front, engraved with &quot;Holiness to the
      Lord,&quot; fastened to it by a ribbon of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the high priest alone it was permitted to enter the holy
      of holies, which he did only once a year, on the great Day
      of Atonement, for &quot;the way into the holiest of all was
      not yet made manifest&quot; (Heb. 9; 10). Wearing his
      gorgeous priestly vestments, he entered the temple before
      all the people, and then, laying them aside and assuming
      only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of
      holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of
      the sin offering on the mercy seat, and offering up
      incense. Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared
      before the people (Lev. 16). Thus the wearing of these
      robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were
      typical of the priesthood of our Lord (Heb. 4:14; 7:25;
      9:12, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is supposed that there were in all eighty-three high
      priests, beginning with Aaron (B.C. 1657) and ending with
      Phannias (A.D. 70). At its first institution the office of
      high priest was held for life (but comp. 1 Kings 2:27), and
      was hereditary in the family of Aaron (Num. 3:10). The
      office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron&#39;s eldest
      son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed
      to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the
      fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar,
      whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of
      Eleazar, in his stead (1 Kings 2:35), in which it remained
      till the time of the Captivity. After the Return, Joshua,
      the son of Josedek, of the family of Eleazar, was appointed
      to this office. After him the succession was changed from
      time to time under priestly or political influences.

      <a name="T0001783"><b>Highway -</b> a raised road for
      public use. Such roads were not found in Palestine; hence
      the force of the language used to describe the return of
      the captives and the advent of the Messiah (Isa. 11:16;
      35:8; 40:3; 62:10) under the figure of the preparation of a
      grand thoroughfare for their march.</a>

    <p>
      During their possession of Palestine the Romans constructed
      several important highways, as they did in all countries
      which they ruled.

      Gemariah (Jer. 29:3). (5.) The father of the prophet
      Jeremiah (1:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) The high priest in the reign of Josiah (1 Chr. 6:13;
      Ezra 7:1). To him and his deputy (2 Kings 23:5), along with
      the ordinary priests and the Levites who had charge of the
      gates, was entrusted the purification of the temple in
      Jerusalem. While this was in progress, he discovered in
      some hidden corner of the building a book called the
      &quot;book of the law&quot; (2 Kings 22:8) and the
      &quot;book of the covenant&quot; (23:2). Some have supposed
      that this &quot;book&quot; was nothing else than the
      original autograph copy of the Pentateuch written by Moses
      (Deut. 31:9-26). This remarkable discovery occurred in the
      eighteenth year of Josiah&#39;s reign (B.C. 624), a
      discovery which permanently affected the whole subsequent
      history of Israel. (See JOSIAH &macr;T0002116; <a href=

      (2.) Heb. har, properly a mountain range rather than an
      individual eminence (Ex. 24:4, 12, 13, 18; Num. 14:40, 44,
      45). In Deut. 1:7, Josh. 9:1; 10:40; 11:16, it denotes the

      south of the Valley of Hinnom. It is so called from a
      tradition that the house of the high priest Caiaphas, when
      the rulers of the Jews resolved to put Christ to death,
      stood here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001788"><b>Hind -</b> Heb. &#39;ayalah (2 Sam.
      22:34; Ps. 18:33, etc.) and &#39;ayeleth (Ps. 22, title),
      the female of the hart or stag. It is referred to as an
      emblem of activity (Gen. 49:21), gentleness (Prov. 5:19),
      feminine modesty (Cant. 2:7; 3:5), earnest longing (Ps.
      42:1), timidity (Ps. 29:9). In the title of Ps. 22, the
      word probably refers to some tune bearing that name.</a>

      <a name="T0001789"><b>Hinge -</b> (Heb. tsir), that on
      which a door revolves. &quot;Doors in the East turn rather
      on pivots than on what we term hinges. In Syria, and
      especially in the Hauran, there are many ancient doors,
      consisting of stone slabs with pivots carved out of the
      same piece inserted in sockets above and below, and fixed
      during the building of the house&quot; (Prov. 26:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001790"><b>Hinnom -</b> a deep, narrow ravine
      separating Mount Zion from the so-called &quot;Hill of Evil
      Counsel.&quot; It took its name from &quot;some ancient
      hero, the son of Hinnom.&quot; It is first mentioned in
      Josh. 15:8. It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews
      burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A
      particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the
      &quot;fire-stove,&quot; where the children were burned.
      After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the
      locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the
      offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was,
      as is supposed, kept constantly burning there.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews associated with this valley these two ideas, (1)
      that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been
      sacrificed; and (2) that of filth and corruption. It became
      thus to the popular mind a symbol of the abode of the
      wicked hereafter. It came to signify hell as the place of
      the wicked. &quot;It might be shown by infinite examples
      that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned,
      by this word. The word Gehenna [the Greek contraction of
      Hinnom] was never used in the time of Christ in any other
      sense than to denote the place of future punishment.&quot;
      About this fact there can be no question. In this sense the
      word is used eleven times in our Lord&#39;s discourses
      (Matt. 23:33; Luke 12:5; Matt. 5:22, etc.).

      <a name="T0001791"><b>Hiram -</b> high-born. (1.) Generally
      &quot;Huram,&quot; one of the sons of Bela (1 Chr.
      8:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Also &quot;Huram&quot; and &quot;Horam,&quot; king of
      Tyre. He entered into an alliance with David, and assisted
      him in building his palace by sending him able workmen, and
      also cedar-trees and fir-trees from Lebanon (2 Sam. 5:11; 1
      Chr. 14:1). After the death of David he entered into a
      similar alliance with Solomon, and assisted him greatly in
      building the temple (1 Kings 5:1; 9:11; 2 Chr. 2:3). He
      also took part in Solomon&#39;s traffic to the Eastern Seas
      (1 Kings 9:27; 10:11; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The &quot;master workman&quot; whom Hiram sent to
      Solomon. He was the son of a widow of Dan, and of a Tyrian
      father. In 2 Chr. 2:13 &quot;Huram my father&quot; should
      be Huram Abi, the word &quot;Abi&quot; (rendered here
      &quot;my father&quot;) being regarded as a proper name, or
      it may perhaps be a title of distinction given to Huram,
      and equivalent to &quot;master.&quot; (Comp. 1 Kings 7:14;
      2 Chr. 4:16.) He cast the magnificent brazen works for
      Solomon&#39;s temple in clay-beds in the valley of Jordan,
      between Succoth and Zarthan.

      In the time of our Lord a day&#39;s wage was a
      &quot;penny&quot; (q.v.) i.e., a Roman denarius (Matt.
      20:1-14).</a>

      Kings 9:8). Zechariah (10:8) speaks of the Lord gathering
      the house of Judah as it were with a hiss: &quot;I will
      hiss for them.&quot; This expression may be &quot;derived
      from the noise made to attract bees in hiving, or from the
      sound naturally made to attract a person&#39;s
      attention.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001794"><b>Hittites -</b> Palestine and Syria
      appear to have been originally inhabited by three different
      tribes. (1.) The Semites, living on the east of the isthmus
      of Suez. They were nomadic and pastoral tribes. (2.) The
      Phoenicians, who were merchants and traders; and (3.) the
      Hittites, who were the warlike element of this
      confederation of tribes. They inhabited the whole region
      between the Euphrates and Damascus, their chief cities
      being Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, now Tell
      Neby Mendeh, in the Orontes valley, about six miles south
      of the Lake of Homs. These Hittites seem to have risen to
      great power as a nation, as for a long time they were
      formidable rivals of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In
      the book of Joshua they always appear as the dominant race
      to the north of Galilee.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere about the twenty-third century B.C. the Syrian
      confederation, led probably by the Hittites, arched against
      Lower Egypt, which they took possession of, making Zoan
      their capital. Their rulers were the Hyksos, or shepherd
      kings. They were at length finally driven out of Egypt.
      Rameses II. sought vengeance against the &quot;vile
      Kheta,&quot; as he called them, and encountered and
      defeated them in the great battle of Kadesh, four centuries
      after Abraham. (See <a href=

      JOSHUA</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      They are first referred to in Scripture in the history of
      Abraham, who bought from Ephron the Hittite the field and
      the cave of Machpelah (Gen. 15:20: 23:3-18). They were then
      settled at Kirjath-arba. From this tribe Esau took his
      first two wives (26:34; 36:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      They are afterwards mentioned in the usual way among the
      inhabitants of the Promised Land (Ex. 23:28). They were
      closely allied to the Amorites, and are frequently
      mentioned along with them as inhabiting the mountains of
      Palestine. When the spies entered the land they seem to
      have occupied with the Amorites the mountain region of
      Judah (Num. 13:29). They took part with the other
      Canaanites against the Israelites (Josh. 9:1; 11:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there are few references to them in Scripture.
      Mention is made of &quot;Ahimelech the Hittite&quot; (1
      Sam. 26:6), and of &quot;Uriah the Hittite,&quot; one of
      David&#39;s chief officers (2 Sam. 23:39; 1 Chr. 11:41). In
      the days of Solomon they were a powerful confederation in
      the north of Syria, and were ruled by &quot;kings.&quot;
      They are met with after the Exile still a distinct people
      (Ezra 9:1; comp. Neh. 13:23-28).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew merchants exported horses from Egypt not only
      for the kings of Israel, but also for the Hittites (1 Kings
      10:28, 29). From the Egyptian monuments we learn that
      &quot;the Hittites were a people with yellow skins and
      &#39;Mongoloid&#39; features, whose receding foreheads,
      oblique eyes, and protruding upper jaws are represented as
      faithfully on their own monuments as they are on those of
      Egypt, so that we cannot accuse the Egyptian artists of
      caricaturing their enemies. The Amorites, on the contrary,
      were a tall and handsome people. They are depicted with
      white skins, blue eyes, and reddish hair, all the
      characteristics, in fact, of the white race&quot;
      (Sayce&#39;s The Hittites). The original seat of the
      Hittite tribes was the mountain ranges of Taurus. They
      belonged to Asia Minor, and not to Syria.

      &quot;midlanders&quot; or &quot;villagers&quot; (Gen.
      10:17; 1 Chr. 1:15). They were probably a branch of the
      Hittites. At the time of Jacob&#39;s return to Canaan,
      Hamor the Hivite was the &quot;prince of the land&quot;
      (Gen. 24:2-28).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are next mentioned during the Conquest (Josh. 9:7;
      11:19). They principally inhabited the northern confines of
      Western Palestine (Josh. 11:3; Judg. 3:3). A remnant of
      them still existed in the time of Solomon (1 Kings 9:20).
