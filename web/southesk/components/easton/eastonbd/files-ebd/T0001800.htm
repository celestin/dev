      <a name="T0001804"><b>Holiness -</b> in the highest sense
      belongs to God (Isa. 6:3; Rev. 15:4), and to Christians as
      consecrated to God&#39;s service, and in so far as they are
      conformed in all things to the will of God (Rom. 6:19, 22;
      Eph. 1:4; Titus 1:8; 1 Pet. 1:15). Personal holiness is a
      work of gradual development. It is carried on under many
      hindrances, hence the frequent admonitions to watchfulness,
      prayer, and perseverance (1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 7:1; Eph.
      4:23, 24). (See <a href=

    <p>
      His personality is proved (1) from the fact that the
      attributes of personality, as intelligence and volition,
      are ascribed to him (John 14:17, 26; 15:26; 1 Cor. 2:10,
      11; 12:11). He reproves, helps, glorifies, intercedes (John
      16:7-13; Rom. 8:26). (2) He executes the offices peculiar
      only to a person. The very nature of these offices involves
      personal distinction (Luke 12:12; Acts 5:32; 15:28; 16:6;
      28:25; 1 Cor. 2:13; Heb. 2:4; 3:7; 2 Pet. 1:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      His divinity is established (1) from the fact that the
      names of God are ascribed to him (Ex. 17:7; Ps. 95:7; comp.
      Heb. 3:7-11); and (2) that divine attributes are also
      ascribed to him, omnipresence (Ps. 139:7; Eph. 2:17, 18; 1
      Cor. 12:13); omniscience (1 Cor. 2:10, 11); omnipotence
      (Luke 1:35; Rom. 8:11); eternity (Heb. 9:4). (3) Creation
      is ascribed to him (Gen. 1:2; Job 26:13; Ps. 104:30), and
      the working of miracles (Matt. 12:28; 1 Cor. 12:9-11). (4)
      Worship is required and ascribed to him (Isa. 6:3; Acts

      <a name="T0001806"><b>Holy of holies -</b> the second or
      interior portion of the tabernacle. It was left in total
      darkness. No one was permitted to enter it except the high
      priest, and that only once a year. It contained the ark of
      the covenant only (Ex. 25:10-16). It was in the form of a
      perfect cube of 20 cubits. (See <a href=

      portions into which the tabernacle was divided (Ex. 26:31;
      37:17-25; Heb. 9:2). It was 20 cubits long and 10 in height
      and breadth. It was illuminated by the golden candlestick,
      as it had no opening to admit the light. It contained the
      table of showbread (Ex. 25:23-29) and the golden altar of
      incense (30:1-11). It was divided from the holy of holies
      by a veil of the most costly materials and the brightest
      colours.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement of the temple (q.v.) was the same in this
      respect. In it the walls of hewn stone were wainscotted
      with cedar and overlaid with gold, and adorned with
      beautiful carvings. It was entered from the porch by
      folding doors overlaid with gold and richly embossed.
      Outside the holy place stood the great tank or
      &quot;sea&quot; of molten brass, supported by twelve oxen,
      three turned each way, capable of containing two thousand
      baths of water. Besides this there were ten lavers and the
      brazen altar of burnt sacrifice.

      measures, containing about 8 bushels or 1 quarter English =
      10 ephahs (Lev. 27:16; Num. 11:32) = a COR. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0001809"><b>Honey -</b> (1.) Heb. ya&#39;ar,
      occurs only 1 Sam. 14:25, 27, 29; Cant. 5:1, where it
      denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies a
      forest or copse, and refers to honey found in woods.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Nopheth, honey that drops (Ps. 19:10; Prov. 5:3; Cant.
      4:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Debash denotes bee-honey (Judg. 14:8); but also
      frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees (Gen.
      43:11; Ezek. 27:17). In these passages it may probably mean
      &quot;dibs,&quot; or syrup of grapes, i.e., the juice of
      ripe grapes boiled down to one-third of its bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Tsuph, the cells of the honey-comb full of honey
      (Prov. 16:24; Ps. 19:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) &quot;Wild honey&quot; (Matt. 3:4) may have been the
      vegetable honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey
      stored by bees in rocks or in trees (Deut. 32:13; Ps.
      81:16; 1 Sam. 14:25-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Canaan was a &quot;land flowing with milk and honey&quot;
      (Ex. 3:8). Milk and honey were among the chief dainties in
      the earlier ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and
      butter and honey are also mentioned among articles of food
      (Isa. 7:15). The ancients used honey instead of sugar (Ps.
      119:103; Prov. 24:13); but when taken in great quantities
      it caused nausea, a fact referred to in Prov. 25:16, 17 to
      inculcate moderation in pleasures. Honey and milk also are
      put for sweet discourse (Cant. 4:11).

      <a name="T0001810"><b>Hood -</b> (Heb. tsaniph) a tiara
      round the head (Isa. 3:23; R.V., pl., &quot;turbans&quot;).
      Rendered &quot;diadem,&quot; Job 29:14; high priest&#39;s
      &quot;mitre,&quot; Zech. 3:5; &quot;royal diadem,&quot;
      Isa. 62:3.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001811"><b>Hoof -</b> a cleft hoof as of neat
      cattle (Ex. 10:26; Ezek. 32:13); hence also of the horse,
      though not cloven (Isa. 5:28). The &quot;parting of the
      hoof&quot; is one of the distinctions between clean and
      unclean animals (Lev. 11:3; Deut. 14:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001812"><b>Hook -</b> (1.) Heb. hah, a
      &quot;ring&quot; inserted in the nostrils of animals to
      which a cord was fastened for the purpose of restraining
      them (2 Kings 19:28; Isa. 37:28, 29; Ezek. 29:4; 38:4).
      &quot;The Orientals make use of this contrivance for
      curbing their work-beasts...When a beast becomes unruly
      they have only to draw the cord on one side, which, by
      stopping his breath, punishes him so effectually that after
      a few repetitions he fails not to become quite tractable
      whenever he begins to feel it&quot; (Michaelis). So
      God&#39;s agents are never beyond his control.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Hakkah, a fish &quot;hook&quot; (Job 41:2, Heb. Text,
      40:25; Isa. 19:8; Hab. 1:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Vav, a &quot;peg&quot; on which the curtains of the
      tabernacle were hung (Ex. 26:32).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Tsinnah, a fish-hooks (Amos 4:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Mazleg, flesh-hooks (1 Sam. 2:13, 14), a kind of fork
      with three teeth for turning the sacrifices on the fire,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) Mazmeroth, pruning-hooks (Isa. 2:4; Joel 3:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) &#39;Agmon (Job 41:2, Heb. Text 40:26), incorrectly
      rendered in the Authorized Version. Properly a rush-rope
      for binding animals, as in Revised Version margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001813"><b>Hope -</b> one of the three main
      elements of Christian character (1 Cor. 13:13). It is
      joined to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing or
      possessing (Rom. 8:24; 1 John 3:2). &quot;Hope is an
      essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so
      essential indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself
      designate the essence of Christianity (1 Pet. 3:15; Heb.
      10:23). In it the whole glory of the Christian vocation is
      centred (Eph. 1:18; 4:4).&quot; Unbelievers are without
      this hope (Eph. 2:12; 1 Thess. 4:13). Christ is the actual
      object of the believer&#39;s hope, because it is in his
      second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled (1
      Tim. 1:1; Col. 1:27; Titus 2:13). It is spoken of as
      &quot;lively&quot;, i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail
      and perishable, but having a perennial life (1 Pet. 1:3).
      In Rom. 5:2 the &quot;hope&quot; spoken of is probably
      objective, i.e., &quot;the hope set before us,&quot;
      namely, eternal life (comp. 12:12). In 1 John 3:3 the
      expression &quot;hope in him&quot; ought rather to be, as
      in the Revised Version, &quot;hope on him,&quot; i.e., a
      hope based on God.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001814"><b>Hophni -</b> pugilist or client, one
      of the two sons of Eli, the high priest (1 Sam. 1:3; 2:34),
      who, because he was &quot;very old,&quot; resigned to them
      the active duties of his office. By their scandalous
      conduct they brought down a curse on their father&#39;s
      house (2:22, 12-27, 27-36; 3:11-14). For their wickedness
      they were called &quot;sons of Belial,&quot; i.e.,
      worthless men (2:12). They both perished in the disastrous
      battle with the Philistines at Aphek (4:11). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0001816"><b>Hor -</b> mountain. (1.) One of the
      mountains of the chain of Seir or Edom, on the confines of
      Idumea (Num. 20:22-29; 33:37). It was one of the stations
      of the Israelites in the wilderness (33:37), which they
      reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take
      because the Edomites refused them a passage through their
      territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron
      died (Num. 33:37-41). (See <a href=

      AARON</a>.) The Israelites passed this mountain several
      times in their wanderings. It bears the modern name of
      Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most conspicious of the
      whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead Sea
      and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow
      between which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others,
      however, suppose that this mountain is the modern Jebel
      Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the western, side of the
      Arabah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of the marks of the northern boundary of Palestine
      (Num. 34:7, 8). Nowhere else mentioned. Perhaps it is one
      of the peaks of Lebanon.

      <a name="T0001817"><b>Horeb -</b> desert or mountain of the
      dried-up ground, a general name for the whole mountain
      range of which Sinai was one of the summits (Ex. 3:1; 17:6;
      33:6; Ps. 106:19, etc.). The modern name of the whole range
      is Jebel Musa. It is a huge mountain block, about 2 miles
      long by about 1 in breadth, with a very spacious plain at
      its north-east end, called the Er Rahah, in which the
      Israelites encamped for nearly a whole year. (See <a href=

      Troglodytes who dwelt in the limestone caves which abounded
      in Edom. Their ancestor was &quot;Seir,&quot; who probably
      gave his name to the district where he lived. They were a
      branch of the Hivites (Gen. 14:6; 36:20-30; 1 Chr. 1:38,
      39). They were dispossessed by the descendants of Esau, and

      under a &quot;ban,&quot; or devoting to utter destruction.
      After the manifestation of God&#39;s anger against the
      Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their
      murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh,
      in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the
      land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed
      to go up &quot;to the head of the mountain,&quot; seeking
      to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the
      Lord, without the ark of the convenant, and without Moses.
      The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and &quot;smote
      and discomfited them even unto Hormah&quot; (Num. 14:45).
      This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was
      originally called Zephath (Judg. 1:17), the modern
      Sebaiteh. Afterwards (Num. 21:1-3) Arad, the king of the
      Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the
      Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh,
      &quot;fought against them, and took some of them
      prisoners.&quot; But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord
      utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they
      &quot;banned&quot; them, and hence the place was now called
      Hormah. But this &quot;ban&quot; was not fully executed
      till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of
      this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became
      &quot;Hormah&quot; (Josh. 12:14; Judg. 1:17).</a>

      But the word is used also metaphorically to denote the
      projecting corners of the altar of burnt offerings (Ex.
      27:2) and of incense (30:2). The horns of the altar of
      burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the
      slain bullock (29:12; Lev. 4:7-18). The criminal, when his
      crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the
      horns of the altar (1 Kings 1:50; 2:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill (Isa.
      5:1, where the word &quot;hill&quot; is the rendering of
      the same Hebrew word).
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is used metaphorically also for strength (Deut.
      33:17) and honour (Job 16:15; Lam. 2:3). Horns are emblems
      of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the
      chief means of attack and defence with the animals endowed
      with them (Dan. 8:5, 9; 1 Sam. 2:1; 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39;
      22:11; Josh. 6:4, 5; Ps. 75:5, 10; 132:17; Luke 1:69,
      etc.). The expression &quot;horn of salvation,&quot;
      applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a
      strong Saviour (Luke 1:69). To have the horn
      &quot;exalted&quot; denotes prosperity and triumph (Ps.
      89:17, 24). To &quot;lift up&quot; the horn is to act
      proudly (Zech. 1:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power (Jer.
      48:25; Zech. 1:18; Dan. 8:24).

      <a name="T0001822"><b>Hornet -</b> Heb. tsir&#39;ah,
      &quot;stinging&quot;, (Ex. 23:28; Deut. 7:20; Josh. 24:12).
      The word is used in these passages as referring to some
      means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out from
      before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is
      used in a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic
      which would seize the people as a &quot;terror of God&quot;
      (Gen. 35:5), the consternation with which God would inspire
      the Canaanites. In Palestine there are four species of
      hornets, differing from our hornets, being larger in size,
      and they are very abundant. They &quot;attack human beings
      in a very furious manner.&quot; &quot;The furious attack of
      a swarm of hornets drives cattle and horses to madness, and
      has even caused the death of the animals.&quot;</a>

      Moab to the south of the Arnon, built, apparently, upon an
      eminence, and a place of some importance (Isa. 15:5; Jer.
      48:3, 5, 34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001824"><b>Horonite -</b> the designation of
      Sanballat (Neh. 2:10, 19), a native of Horonaim, or of one
      of the two Beth-horons, the &quot;upper&quot; or the
      &quot;nether,&quot; mentioned in Josh. 16:3,5.</a>

      <a name="T0001825"><b>Horse -</b> always referred to in the
      Bible in connection with warlike operations, except Isa.
      28:28. The war-horse is described Job 39:19-25. For a long
      period after their settlement in Canaan the Israelites made
      no use of horses, according to the prohibition, Deut.
      17:16. David was the first to form a force of cavalry (2
      Sam. 8:4). But Solomon, from his connection with Egypt,
      greatly multiplied their number (1 Kings 4:26; 10:26, 29).
      After this, horses were freely used in Israel (1 Kings
      22:4; 2 Kings 3:7; 9:21, 33; 11:16). The furniture of the
      horse consisted simply of a bridle (Isa. 30:28) and a curb
      (Ps. 32:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001826"><b>Horse-gate -</b> a gate in the wall
      of Jerusalem, at the west end of the bridge, leading from
      Zion to the temple (Neh. 3:28; Jer. 31:40).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001827"><b>Horse-leech -</b> occurs only in
      Prov. 30:15 (Heb. &#39;alukah); the generic name for any
      blood-sucking annelid. There are various species in the
      marshes and pools of Palestine. That here referred to, the
      Hoemopis, is remarkable for the coarseness of its bite, and
      is therefore not used for medical purposes. They are spoken
      of in the East with feelings of aversion and horror,
      because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and
      nostrils of horses when they come to drink out of the
      pools. The medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis), besides
      other species of leeches, are common in the waters of
      Syria.</a>

      who rode in chariots. The army of Pharaoh consisted of a
      chariot and infantry force. We find that at a later period,
      however, the Egyptians had cavalry (2 Chr. 12:3). (See <a

      Beeri, and author of the book of prophecies bearing his
      name. He belonged to the kingdom of Israel. &quot;His
      Israelitish origin is attested by the peculiar, rough,
      Aramaizing diction, pointing to the northern part of
      Palestine; by the intimate acquaintance he evinces with the
      localities of Ephraim (5:1; 6:8, 9; 12:12; 14:6, etc.); by
      passages like 1:2, where the kingdom is styled &#39;the
      land&#39;, and 7:5, where the Israelitish king is
      designated as &#39;our&#39; king.&quot; The period of his
      ministry (extending to some sixty years) is indicated in
      the superscription (Hos. 1:1, 2). He is the only prophet of
      Israel who has left any written prophecy.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001833"><b>Hosea, Prophecies of -</b> This book
      stands first in order among the &quot;Minor Prophets.&quot;
      &quot;The probable cause of the location of Hosea may be
      the thoroughly national character of his oracles, their
      length, their earnest tone, and vivid
      representations.&quot; This was the longest of the
      prophetic books written before the Captivity. Hosea
      prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel&#39;s
      history, the period of Israel&#39;s decline and fall. Their
      sins had brought upon them great national disasters.
      &quot;Their homicides and fornication, their perjury and
      theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and
      satirized with a faithful severity.&quot; He was a
      contemporary of Isaiah. The book may be divided into two
      parts, the first containing chapters 1-3, and symbolically
      representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery borrowed
      from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and
      adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to
      represent the spiritual relations between Jehovah and the
      people of Israel. Here we see the apostasy of Israel and
      their punishment, with their future repentance,
      forgiveness, and restoration.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second part, containing 4-14, is a summary of
      Hosea&#39;s discourses, filled with denunciations,
      threatenings, exhortations, promises, and revelations of
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quotations from Hosea are found in Matt. 2:15; 9:15; 12:7;
      Rom. 9:25, 26. There are, in addition, various allusions to
      it in other places (Luke 23:30; Rev. 6:16, comp. Hos. 10:8;
      Rom. 9:25, 26; 1 Pet. 2:10, comp. Hos. 1:10, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the style of this writer, it has been said that
      &quot;each verse forms a whole for itself, like one heavy
      toll in a funeral knell.&quot; &quot;Inversions (7:8; 9:11,
      13; 12: 8), anacolutha (9:6; 12:8, etc.), ellipses (9:4;
      13:9, etc.), paranomasias, and plays upon words, are very
      characteristic of Hosea (8:7; 9:15; 10:5; 11:5;
      12:11).&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001834"><b>Hoshea -</b> salvation. (1.) The
      original name of the son of Nun, afterwards called Joshua
      (Num. 13:8, 16; Deut. 32:44).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) 1 Chr. 27:20. The ruler of Ephraim in David&#39;s
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The last king of Israel. He conspired against and slew
      his predecessor, Pekah (Isa. 7:16), but did not ascend the
      throne till after an interregnum of warfare of eight years
      (2 Kings 17:1, 2). Soon after this he submitted to
      Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king, who a second time invaded
      the land to punish Hoshea, because of his withholding
      tribute which he had promised to pay. A second revolt
      brought back the Assyrian king Sargon, who besieged
      Samaria, and carried the ten tribes away beyond the
      Euphrates, B.C. 720 (2 Kings 17:5, 6; 18:9-12). No more is
      heard of Hoshea. He disappeared like &quot;foam upon the
      water&quot; (Hos. 10:7; 13:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001835"><b>Host -</b> an entertainer (Rom.
      16:23); a tavern-keeper, the keeper of a caravansary (Luke
      10:35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In warfare, a troop or military force. This consisted at
      first only of infantry. Solomon afterwards added cavalry (1
      Kings 4:26; 10:26). Every male Israelite from twenty to
      fifty years of age was bound by the law to bear arms when
      necessary (Num. 1:3; 26:2; 2 Chr. 25:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul was the first to form a standing army (1 Sam. 13:2;
      24:2). This example was followed by David (1 Chr. 27:1),
      and Solomon (1 Kings 4:26), and by the kings of Israel and
      Judah (2 Chr. 17:14; 26:11; 2 Kings 11:4, etc.).

      <a name="T0001836"><b>Hostage -</b> a person delivered into
      the hands of another as a security for the performance of

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001837"><b>Host of heaven -</b> The sun, moon,

      the &quot;tendon of Achilles&quot; of the hinder legs of
      captured horses (Josh. 11:6; 2 Sam. 8:4; 1 Chr. 18:4), so
      as to render them useless.</a>

      <a name="T0001839"><b>Hour -</b> First found in Dan. 3:6;
      4:19, 33;5:5. It is the rendering of the Chaldee shaah,
      meaning a &quot;moment,&quot; a &quot;look.&quot; It is
      used in the New Testament frequently to denote some
      determinate season (Matt. 8:13; Luke 12:39).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the ancient Hebrews the divisions of the day were
      &quot;morning, evening, and noon-day&quot; (Ps. 55:17,
      etc.). The Greeks, following the Babylonians, divided the
      day into twelve hours. The Jews, during the Captivity,
      learned also from the Babylonians this method of dividing
      time. When Judea became subject to the Romans, the Jews
      adopted the Roman mode of reckoning time. The night was
      divided into four watches (Luke 12:38; Matt. 14:25; 13:25).
      Frequent allusion is also made to hours (Matt. 25:13;
      26:40, etc.). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000900.html&amp;from=T0000984&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      DAY</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour was the twelfth part of the day, reckoning from
      sunrise to sunset, and consequently it perpetually varied
      in length.

    <p>
      <a name="T0001840"><b>House -</b> Till their sojourn in
      Egypt the Hebrews dwelt in tents. They then for the first
      time inhabited cities (Gen. 47:3; Ex. 12:7; Heb. 11:9).
      From the earliest times the Assyrians and the Canaanites
      were builders of cities. The Hebrews after the Conquest
      took possession of the captured cities, and seem to have
      followed the methods of building that had been pursued by
      the Canaanites. Reference is made to the stone (1 Kings
      7:9; Isa. 9:10) and marble (1 Chr. 29:2) used in building,
      and to the internal wood-work of the houses (1 Kings 6:15;
      7:2; 10:11, 12; 2 Chr. 3:5; Jer. 22:14). &quot;Ceiled
      houses&quot; were such as had beams inlaid in the walls to
      which wainscotting was fastened (Ezra 6:4; Jer. 22:14; Hag.
      1:4). &quot;Ivory houses&quot; had the upper parts of the
      walls adorned with figures in stucco with gold and ivory (1
      Kings 22:39; 2 Chr. 3:6; Ps. 45:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The roofs of the dwelling-houses were flat, and are often
      alluded to in Scripture (2 Sam. 11:2; Isa. 22:1; Matt.
      24:17). Sometimes tents or booths were erected on them (2
      Sam. 16:22). They were protected by parapets or low walls
      (Deut. 22:8). On the house-tops grass sometimes grew (Prov.
      19:13; 27:15; Ps. 129:6, 7). They were used, not only as
      places of recreation in the evening, but also sometimes as
      sleeping-places at night (1 Sam. 9:25, 26; 2 Sam. 11:2;
      16:22; Dan. 4:29; Job 27:18; Prov. 21:9), and as places of

      53; Matt. 26:59, 67; Ps. 22:6; Matt. 26:68), (4) his soul
      (Ps. 22:1; Matt. 4:1-11; Luke 22:44; Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15),

      his burial (Isa. 53:9; Matt. 27:57, 58, 60).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His humiliation was necessary (1) to execute the purpose of

      Testament types and prophecies, (3) satisfy the law in the

      grace (Rom. 12:3; 15:17, 18; 1 Cor. 3:5-7; 2 Cor. 3:5;
      Phil. 4:11-13). It is a state of mind well pleasing to God
      (1 Pet. 3:4); it preserves the soul in tranquillity (Ps.
      69:32, 33), and makes us patient under trials (Job
      1:22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ has set us an example of humility (Phil. 2:6-8). We
      should be led thereto by a remembrance of our sins (Lam.
      3:39), and by the thought that it is the way to honour
      (Prov. 16:18), and that the greatest promises are made to
      the humble (Ps. 147:6; Isa. 57:15; 66:2; 1 Pet. 5:5). It is
      a &quot;great paradox in Christianity that it makes
      humility the avenue to glory.&quot;

      10:9 in connection with Nimrod. Esau was &quot;a cunning
      hunter&quot; (Gen. 25:27). Hunting was practised by the
      Hebrews after their settlement in the &quot;Land of
      Promise&quot; (Lev. 17:15; Prov. 12:27). The lion and other
      ravenous beasts were found in Palestine (1 Sam. 17:34; 2
      Sam. 23:20; 1 Kings 13:24; Ezek. 19:3-8), and it must have
      been necessary to hunt and destroy them. Various snares and
      gins were used in hunting (Ps. 91:3; Amos 3:5; 2 Sam.
      23:20).</a>

      rebellion of Absalom, and had reached the summit of Olivet,
      he there met Hushai, whom he sent back to Jerusalem for the
      purpose of counteracting the influence of Ahithophel, who
      had joined the ranks of Absalom (2 Sam. 15:32, 37;
      16:16-18). It was by his advice that Absalom refrained from
      immediately pursuing after David. By this delay the cause

      <a name="T0001852"><b>Husk -</b> In Num. 6:4 (Heb. zag) it
      means the &quot;skin&quot; of a grape. In 2 Kings 4:42
      (Heb. tsiqlon) it means a &quot;sack&quot; for grain, as
      rendered in the Revised Version. In Luke 15:16, in the
      parable of the Prodigal Son, it designates the beans of the
      carob tree, or Ceratonia siliqua. From the supposition,
      mistaken, however, that it was on the husks of this tree
      that John the Baptist fed, it is called &quot;St.
      John&#39;s bread&quot; and &quot;locust tree.&quot; This
      tree is in &quot;February covered with innumerable
      purple-red pendent blossoms, which ripen in April and May
      into large crops of pods from 6 to 10 inches long, flat,
      brown, narrow, and bent like a horn (whence the Greek name
      keratia, meaning &#39;little horns&#39;), with a sweetish
      taste when still unripe. Enormous quantities of these are
      gathered for sale in various towns and for
      exportation.&quot; &quot;They were eaten as food, though
      only by the poorest of the poor, in the time of our

      <a name="T0001853"><b>Hymn -</b> occurs only Eph. 5:19 and
      Col. 3:16. The verb to &quot;sing an hymn&quot; occurs
      Matt. 26:30 and Mark 14:26. The same Greek word is rendered
      to &quot;sing praises&quot; Acts 16:25 (R.V., &quot;sing
      hymns&quot;) and Heb. 2:12. The &quot;hymn&quot; which our
      Lord sang with his disciples at the last Supper is
      generally supposed to have been the latter part of the
      Hallel, comprehending Ps. 113-118. It was thus a name given
      to a number of psalms taken together and forming a
      devotional exercise.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The noun hymn is used only with reference to the services
      of the Greeks, and was distinguished from the psalm. The
      Greek tunes required Greek hymns. Our information regarding
      the hymnology of the early Christians is very limited.

      Pharisees for their hypocrisy (Matt. 6:2, 5, 16). &quot;The
      hypocrite&#39;s hope shall perish&quot; (Job 8:13). The
      Hebrew word here rendered &quot;hypocrite&quot; rather
      means the &quot;godless&quot; or &quot;profane,&quot; as it
      is rendered in Jer. 23:11, i.e., polluted with crimes.</a>

      is spoken of as a plant &quot;springing out of the
      wall&quot; (1 Kings 4:33). Many conjectures have been
      formed as to what this plant really was. Some contend that
      it was a species of marjoram (origanum), six species of
      which are found in Palestine. Others with more probability
      think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis spinosa of
      Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai,
      and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three
      or four feet in length (Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36. Comp. John

      that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed

      they fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium,

      divine honour paid to any created object. Paul describes
      the origin of idolatry in Rom. 1:21-25: men forsook God,
      and sank into ignorance and moral corruption (1:28).</a>

    <p>
      The forms of idolatry are, (1.) Fetishism, or the worship
      of trees, rivers, hills, stones, etc.

    <p>
      (2.) Nature worship, the worship of the sun, moon, and
      stars, as the supposed powers of nature.

    <p>
      (3.) Hero worship, the worship of deceased ancestors, or of
      heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Scripture, idolatry is regarded as of heathen origin,
      and as being imported among the Hebrews through contact
      with heathen nations. The first allusion to idolatry is in
      the account of Rachel stealing her father&#39;s teraphim
      (Gen. 31:19), which were the relics of the worship of other
      gods by Laban&#39;s progenitors &quot;on the other side of
      the river in old time&quot; (Josh. 24:2). During their long
      residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it
      was long before they were delivered from it (Josh. 24:14;
      Ezek. 20:7). Many a token of God&#39;s displeasure fell
      upon them because of this sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from
      among the people during the forty years&#39; wanderings;
      but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact
      with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the
      old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to
      depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous
      practices of those heathen nations. It was their great
      national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the
      Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of
      all idolatrous tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first and second commandments are directed against
      idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were
      equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual
      offender was devoted to destruction (Ex. 22:20). His
      nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and
      deliver him up to punishment (Deut. 13:20-10), but their
      hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence
      of two witnesses at least, he was stoned (Deut. 17:2-7). To
      attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of
      equal enormity (13:6-10). An idolatrous nation shared the
      same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old
      Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was
      the punishment of their idolatry (Ex. 34:15, 16; Deut. 7;
      12:29-31; 20:17), and that the calamities of the Israelites
      were due to the same cause (Jer. 2:17). &quot;A city guilty
      of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it
      was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to
      the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were
      put to death.&quot; Jehovah was the theocratic King of
      Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore
      to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence (1 Sam.
      15:23), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the
      Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of
      the existing idolatry of the Canaanites (Ex. 23:24, 32;
      34:13; Deut. 7:5, 25; 12:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate
      covetousness (Matt. 6:24; Luke 16:13; Col. 3:5; Eph. 5:5).

      existence. The doctrine of immortality is taught in the Old
      Testament. It is plainly implied in the writings of Moses
      (Gen. 5:22, 24; 25:8; 37:35; 47:9; 49:29, comp. Heb.
      11:13-16; Ex. 3:6, comp. Matt. 22:23). It is more clearly
      and fully taught in the later books (Isa. 14:9; Ps. 17:15;
      49:15; 73:24). It was thus a doctrine obviously well known
      to the Jews.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the full revelation of the gospel this doctrine was
      &quot;brought to light&quot; (2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 15; 2
      Cor. 5:1-6; 1 Thess. 4:13-18).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001878"><b>Imputation -</b> is used to designate
      any action or word or thing as reckoned to a person. Thus
      in doctrinal language (1) the sin of Adam is imputed to all
      his descendants, i.e., it is reckoned as theirs, and they
      are dealt with therefore as guilty; (2) the righteousness
      of Christ is imputed to them that believe in him, or so
      attributed to them as to be considered their own; and (3)
      our sins are imputed to Christ, i.e., he assumed our
      &quot;law-place,&quot; undertook to answer the demands of
      justice for our sins. In all these cases the nature of
      imputation is the same (Rom. 5:12-19; comp. Philemon 1:18,
      19).</a>

      <a name="T0001879"><b>Incarnation -</b> that act of grace
      whereby Christ took our human nature into union with his
      Divine Person, became man. Christ is both God and man.
      Human attributes and actions are predicated of him, and he
      of whom they are predicated is God. A Divine Person was
      united to a human nature (Acts 20:28; Rom. 8:32; 1 Cor.
      2:8; Heb. 2:11-14; 1 Tim. 3:16; Gal. 4:4, etc.). The union
      is hypostatical, i.e., is personal; the two natures are not
      mixed or confounded, and it is perpetual.</a>

      prepared by the &quot;art of the apothecary.&quot; It
      consisted of four ingredients &quot;beaten small&quot; (Ex.
      30:34-36). That which was not thus prepared was called
      &quot;strange incense&quot; (30:9). It was offered along
      with every meat-offering; and besides was daily offered on
      the golden altar in the holy place, and on the great day of
      atonement was burnt by the high priest in the holy of
      holies (30:7, 8). It was the symbol of prayer (Ps. 141:1,2;
      Rev. 5:8; 8:3, 4).</a>

      and 8:9, where the extent of the dominion of the Persian
      king is described. The country so designated here is not
      the peninsula of Hindustan, but the country surrounding the
      Indus, the Punjab. The people and the products of India
      were well known to the Jews, who seem to have carried on an
      active trade with that country (Ezek. 27:15, 24).</a>

      the translators, because in former times in this country

      correspond to the European inn, are not alluded to in the
      Old Testament. The &quot;inn&quot; mentioned in Ex. 4:24
      was just the halting-place of the caravan. In later times
      khans were erected for the accommodation of travellers. In
      Luke 2:7 the word there so rendered denotes a place for
      loosing the beasts of their burdens. It is rendered
      &quot;guest-chamber&quot; in Mark 14:14 and Luke 22:11. In
      Luke 10:34 the word so rendered is different. That inn had
      an &quot;inn-keeper,&quot; who attended to the wants of
      travellers.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001884"><b>Inspiration -</b> that extraordinary
      or supernatural divine influence vouchsafed to those who
      wrote the Holy Scriptures, rendering their writings
      infallible. &quot;All scripture is given by inspiration of
      God&quot; (R.V., &quot;Every scripture inspired of
      God&quot;), 2 Tim. 3:16. This is true of all the
      &quot;sacred writings,&quot; not in the sense of their
      being works of genius or of supernatural insight, but as
      &quot;theopneustic,&quot; i.e., &quot;breathed into by
      God&quot; in such a sense that the writers were
      supernaturally guided to express exactly what God intended
      them to express as a revelation of his mind and will. The
      testimony of the sacred writers themselves abundantly
      demonstrates this truth; and if they are infallible as
      teachers of doctrine, then the doctrine of plenary
      inspiration must be accepted. There are no errors in the
      Bible as it came from God, none have been proved to exist.
      Difficulties and phenomena we cannot explain are not
      errors. All these books of the Old and New Testaments are
      inspired. We do not say that they contain, but that they
      are, the Word of God. The gift of inspiration rendered the
      writers the organs of God, for the infallible communication
      of his mind and will, in the very manner and words in which
      it was originally given.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the nature of inspiration we have no information.
      This only we know, it rendered the writers infallible. They
      were all equally inspired, and are all equally infallible.
      The inspiration of the sacred writers did not change their
      characters. They retained all their individual
      peculiarities as thinkers or writers. (See BIBLE

      <a name="T0001885"><b>Intercession of Christ -</b>
      Christ&#39;s priestly office consists of these two parts,
      (1) the offering up of himself as a sacrifice, and (2)
      making continual intercession for us.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When on earth he made intercession for his people (Luke
      23:34; John 17:20; Heb. 5:7); but now he exercises this
      function of his priesthood in heaven, where he is said to
      appear in the presence of God for us (Heb. 9:12,24).
    </p>
    <p>
      His advocacy with the Father for his people rests on the
      basis of his own all-perfect sacrifice. Thus he pleads for
      and obtains the fulfilment of all the promises of the
      everlasting covenant (1 John 2:1; John 17:24; Heb. 7:25).
      He can be &quot;touched with the feeling of our
      infirmities,&quot; and is both a merciful and a faithful
      high priest (Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15, 16). This intercession is
      an essential part of his mediatorial work. Through him we
      have &quot;access&quot; to the Father (John 14:6; Eph.
      2:18; 3:12). &quot;The communion of his people with the
      Father will ever be sustained through him as mediatorial
      Priest&quot; (Ps. 110:4; Rev. 7:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001886"><b>Intercession of the Spirit -</b>
      (Rom. 8:26, 27; John 14:26). &quot;Christ is a royal Priest
      (Zech. 6:13). From the same throne, as King, he dispenses
      his Spirit to all the objects of his care, while as Priest
      he intercedes for them. The Spirit acts for him, taking
      only of his things. They both act with one consent, Christ
      as principal, the Spirit as his agent. Christ intercedes
      for us, without us, as our advocate in heaven, according to
      the provisions of the everlasting covenant. The Holy Spirit
      works upon our minds and hearts, enlightening and
      quickening, and thus determining our desires &#39;according
      to the will of God,&#39; as our advocate within us. The
      work of the one is complementary to that of the other, and
      together they form a complete whole.&quot;, Hodge&#39;s

      wrought it at Sinai before the Exodus. David prepared it in
      great abundance for the temple (1 Chr. 22:3: 29:7). The
      merchants of Dan and Javan brought it to the market of Tyre
      (Ezek. 27:19). Various instruments are mentioned as made of
      iron (Deut. 27:5; 19:5; Josh. 17:16, 18; 1 Sam. 17:7; 2
      Sam. 12:31; 2 Kings 6:5, 6; 1 Chr. 22:3; Isa. 10:34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Figuratively, a yoke of iron (Deut. 28:48) denotes hard
      service; a rod of iron (Ps. 2:9), a stern government; a
      pillar of iron (Jer. 1:18), a strong support; a furnace of
      iron (Deut. 4:20), severe labour; a bar of iron (Job
      40:18), strength; fetters of iron (Ps. 107:10), affliction;
      giving silver for iron (Isa. 60:17), prosperity.

      in Palestine, water was generally stored up in winter in
      reservoirs, and distributed through gardens in numerous
      rills, which could easily be turned or diverted by the foot
      (Deut. 11:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      For purposes of irrigation, water was raised from streams
      or pools by water-wheels, or by a shaduf, commonly used on
      the banks of the Nile to the present day.

    <p>
      (2.) The only son of Abraham by Sarah. He was the longest
      lived of the three patriarchs (Gen. 21:1-3). He was
      circumcised when eight days old (4-7); and when he was
      probably two years old a great feast was held in connection
      with his being weaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next memorable event in his life is that connected with
      the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a
      sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah (Gen. 22).
      (See <a href=

      ABRAHAM</a>.) When he was forty years of age Rebekah was
      chosen for his wife (Gen. 24). After the death and burial
      of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi
      (25:7-11), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born
      (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his
      favourite son (27,28).
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of a famine (Gen. 26:1) Isaac went to Gerar,
      where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah,
      imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (12:12-20) and
      in Gerar (20:2). The Philistine king rebuked him for his
      prevarication.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sojourning for some time in the land of the
      Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him
      fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech
      entered into a covenant of peace with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his
      sons (Gen. 27:1). He died at Mamre, &quot;being old and
      full of days&quot; (35:27-29), one hundred and eighty years
      old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament reference is made to his having been
      &quot;offered up&quot; by his father (Heb. 11:17; James
      2:21), and to his blessing his sons (Heb. 11:20). As the
      child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael (Rom. 9:7,
      10; Gal. 4:28; Heb. 11:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac is &quot;at once a counterpart of his father in
      simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his
      passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may
      have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife.
      After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no
      competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah&#39;s tent,
      moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to
      her strong, loving will.&quot; His life was so quiet and
      uneventful that it was spent &quot;within the circle of a
      few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him
      rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his
      mother&#39;s death was the poignant sorrow of years; so
      patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was
      dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of
      living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that
      he put his life at his father&#39;s disposal; so firm in
      his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life
      was to honour the divine promise given to his race.&quot;,

      <a name="T0001895"><b>Isaiah -</b> (Heb. Yesh&#39;yahu,
      i.e., &quot;the salvation of Jehovah&quot;). (1.) The son
      of Amoz (Isa. 1:1; 2:1), who was apparently a man of humble
      rank. His wife was called &quot;the prophetess&quot; (8:3),
      either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift,
      like Deborah (Judg. 4:4) and Huldah (2 Kings 22:14-20), or
      simply because she was the wife of &quot;the prophet&quot;
      (Isa. 38:1). He had two sons, who bore symbolical
      names.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns
      of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1).
      Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah
      must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah&#39;s
      death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year
      of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch
      (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for
      some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied
      for the long period of at least sixty-four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A
      second call came to him &quot;in the year that King Uzziah
      died&quot; (Isa. 6:1). He exercised his ministry in a
      spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to
      all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals
      nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was
      also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned
      reverence toward &quot;the holy One of Israel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion
      of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), 2 Kings
      15:19; and again, twenty years later, when he had already
      entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser
      and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this
      crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and
      Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that
      account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and
      Pekah of Samaria (2 Kings 16:5; 2 Chr. 28:5, 6). Ahaz, thus
      humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of
      Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence
      was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the
      people carried captive to Assyria (2 Kings 15:29; 16:9; 1
      Chr. 5:26). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly
      to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and
      destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom
      of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his
      accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who
      &quot;rebelled against the king of Assyria&quot; (2 Kings
      18:7), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted
      the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah (Isa.
      10:24; 37:6), entered into an alliance with the king of
      Egypt (Isa. 30:2-4). This led the king of Assyria to
      threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the
      land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into
      Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted
      to the Assyrians (2 Kings 18:14-16). But after a brief
      interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.)
      led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which
      threatened Jerusalem (Isa. 36:2-22; 37:8). Isaiah on that
      occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians
      (37:1-7), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter
      to Hezekiah, which he &quot;spread before the Lord&quot;
      (37:14). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian
      host. &quot;Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never
      recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made
      no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or
      Egypt.&quot; The remaining years of Hezekiah&#39;s reign
      were peaceful (2 Chr. 32:23, 27-29). Isaiah probably lived
      to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but
      the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a
      tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen
      reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).

      <a name="T0001896"><b>Isaiah, The Book of -</b> consists of
      prophecies delivered (Isa. 1) in the reign of Uzziah (1-5),
      (2) of Jotham (6), (3) Ahaz (7-14:28), (4) the first half
      of Hezekiah&#39;s reign (14:28-35), (5) the second half of
      Hezekiah&#39;s reign (36-66). Thus, counting from the
      fourth year before Uzziah&#39;s death (B.C. 762) to the
      last year of Hezekiah (B.C. 698), Isaiah&#39;s ministry
      extended over a period of sixty-four years. He may,
      however, have survived Hezekiah, and may have perished in
      the way indicated above.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, as a whole, has been divided into three main
      parts: (1.) The first thirty-five chapters, almost wholly
      prophetic, Israel&#39;s enemy Assyria, present the Messiah
      as a mighty Ruler and King. (2.) Four chapters are
      historical (36-39), relating to the times of Hezekiah. (3.)
      Prophetical (40-66), Israel&#39;s enemy Babylon, describing
      the Messiah as a suffering victim, meek and lowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genuineness of the section Isa. 40-66 has been keenly
      opposed by able critics. They assert that it must be the
      production of a deutero-Isaiah, who lived toward the close
      of the Babylonian captivity. This theory was originated by
      Koppe, a German writer at the close of the last century.
      There are other portions of the book also (e.g., ch. 13;
      24-27; and certain verses in ch. 14 and 21) which they
      attribute to some other prophet than Isaiah. Thus they say
      that some five or seven, or even more, unknown prophets had
      a hand in the production of this book. The considerations
      which have led to such a result are various: (1.) They
      cannot, as some say, conceive it possible that Isaiah,
      living in B.C. 700, could foretell the appearance and the
      exploits of a prince called Cyrus, who would set the Jews
      free from captivity one hundred and seventy years after.
      (2.) It is alleged that the prophet takes the time of the
      Captivity as his standpoint, and speaks of it as then
      present; and (3) that there is such a difference between
      the style and language of the closing section (40-66) and
      those of the preceding chapters as to necessitate a
      different authorship, and lead to the conclusion that there
      were at least two Isaiahs. But even granting the fact of a
      great diversity of style and language, this will not
      necessitate the conclusion attempted to be drawn from it.
      The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities
      of the prophet&#39;s position at the time the prophecies
      were uttered will sufficiently account for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quite
      conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250)
      the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah,
      the son of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover,
      that in the time of our Lord the book existed in the form
      in which we now have it. Many prophecies in the disputed
      portions are quoted in the New Testament as the words of
      Isaiah (Matt. 3:3; Luke 3:4-6; 4:16-41; John 12:38; Acts
      8:28; Rom. 10:16-21). Universal and persistent tradition
      has ascribed the whole book to one author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in the
      language and style, in the thoughts and images and
      rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion;
      and its local colouring and allusions show that it is
      obviously of Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a
      double authorship of the book, much less of a manifold
      authorship, cannot be maintained. The book, with all the
      diversity of its contents, is one, and is, we believe, the
      production of the great prophet whose name it bears.
