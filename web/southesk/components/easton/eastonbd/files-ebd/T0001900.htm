      only one who survived him (2 Sam. 2-4). His name was
      originally Eshbaal (1 Chr. 8:33; 9:39). He was about forty
      years of age when his father and three brothers fell at the
      battle of Gilboa. Through the influence of Abner,
      Saul&#39;s cousin, he was acknowledged as successor to the
      throne of Saul, and ruled over all Israel, except the tribe
      of Judah (over whom David was king), for two years, having
      Mahanaim, on the east of Jordan, as his capital (2 Sam.
      2:9). After a troubled and uncertain reign he was murdered
      by his guard, who stabbed him while he was asleep on his
      couch at mid-day (2 Sam. 4:5-7); and having cut off his
      head, presented it to David, who sternly rebuked them for
      this cold-blooded murder, and ordered them to be
      immediately executed (9-12).</a>

      Abraham&#39;s eldest son, by Hagar the concubine (Gen.
      16:15; 17:23). He was born at Mamre, when Abraham was
      eighty-six years of age, eleven years after his arrival in
      Canaan (16:3; 21:5). At the age of thirteen he was
      circumcised (17:25). He grew up a true child of the desert,
      wild and wayward. On the occasion of the weaning of Isaac
      his rude and wayward spirit broke out in expressions of
      insult and mockery (21:9, 10); and Sarah, discovering this,
      said to Abraham, &quot;Expel this slave and her son.&quot;
      Influenced by a divine admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar
      and her son with no more than a skin of water and some
      bread. The narrative describing this act is one of the most
      beautiful and touching incidents of patriarchal life (Gen.
      21:14-16). (See <a href=

    <p>
      Ishmael settled in the land of Paran, a region lying
      between Canaan and the mountains of Sinai; and &quot;God
      was with him, and he became a great archer&quot; (Gen.
      21:9-21). He became a great desert chief, but of his
      history little is recorded. He was about ninety years of
      age when his father Abraham died, in connection with whose
      burial he once more for a moment reappears. On this
      occasion the two brothers met after being long separated.
      &quot;Isaac with his hundreds of household slaves, Ishmael
      with his troops of wild retainers and half-savage allies,
      in all the state of a Bedouin prince, gathered before the
      cave of Machpelah, in the midst of the men of Heth, to pay
      the last duties to the &#39;father of the faithful,&#39;
      would make a notable subject for an artist&quot; (Gen.
      25:9). Of the after events of his life but little is known.
      He died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years,
      but where and when are unknown (25:17). He had twelve sons,
      who became the founders of so many Arab tribes or colonies,
      the Ishmaelites, who spread over the wide desert spaces of
      Northern Arabia from the Red Sea to the Euphrates (Gen.
      37:25, 27, 28; 39:1), &quot;their hand against every man,
      and every man&#39;s hand against them.&quot;

      many captives, &quot;and departed to go over to the

      signification (Isa. 42:4, 10, 12, 15, comp. Jer. 47:4), but
      more frequently simply denotes a maritime region or
      sea-coast (Isa. 20:6, R.V.,&quot; coastland;&quot; 23:2, 6;
      Jer. 2:10; Ezek. 27:6, 7). (See <a href=

      called &quot;Israelites,&quot; the &quot;children of
      Israel&quot; (Josh. 3:17; 7:25; Judg. 8:27; Jer. 3:21), and
      the &quot;house of Israel&quot; (Ex. 16:31; 40:38).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the
      true Israel (Ps. 73:1: Isa. 45:17; 49:3; John 1:47; Rom.
      9:6; 11:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to
      themselves this name, as if they were the whole nation (2
      Sam. 2:9, 10, 17, 28; 3:10, 17; 19:40-43), and the kings of
      the ten tribes were called &quot;kings of Israel,&quot;
      while the kings of the two tribes were called &quot;kings
      of Judah.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Exile the name Israel was assumed as designating
      the entire nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001909"><b>Israel, Kingdom of -</b> (B.C.
      975-B.C. 722). Soon after the death of Solomon,
      Ahijah&#39;s prophecy (1 Kings 11:31-35) was fulfilled, and
      the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam, the son and
      successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne
      when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes
      broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the
      malcontents (12:2,3). Rehoboam insolently refused to
      lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his
      father had imposed on his subjects (12:4), and the
      rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised
      the old cry, &quot;Every man to his tents, O Israel&quot;
      (2 Sam. 20:1). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:1-18;
      2 Chr. 10), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all
      Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to
      Solomon&#39;s son. War, with varying success, was carried
      on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till
      Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of
      Ahab.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of
      Palestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the
      shore of the Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000
      square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about
      9,375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this
      kingdom (1 Kings 12:25), afterwards Tirza (14:17). Samaria
      was subsequently chosen as the capital (16:24), and
      continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by
      the Assyrians (2 Kings 17:5). During the siege of Samaria
      (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians,
      Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself
      thus records the capture of that city: &quot;Samaria I
      looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried
      away&quot; (2 Kings 17:6) into Assyria. Thus after a
      duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom
      of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered
      throughout the East. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000700.html&amp;from=T0000720&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      CAPTIVITY</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one
      hundred and twenty-three years, and became the
      rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe, and
      eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the
      people who in the last struggle escaped into the
      territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries
      naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their
      race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon,
      many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and
      swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a
      second Palestine.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land
      was colonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of
      Assyria sent thither (Ezra 4:2, 10; 2 Kings 17:24-29). (See

      In contrast with the kingdom of Judah is that of Israel.
      (1.) &quot;There was no fixed capital and no religious
      centre. (2.) The army was often insubordinate. (3.) The
      succession was constantly interrupted, so that out of
      nineteen kings there were no less than nine dynasties, each
      ushered in by a revolution. (4.) The authorized priests
      left the kingdom in a body, and the priesthood established
      by Jeroboam had no divine sanction and no promise; it was
      corrupt at its very source.&quot; (Maclean&#39;s O. T.

      After the entrance into the Promised Land, this tribe was
      one of the six which stood on Gerizim during the ceremony
      of the blessing and cursing (Deut. 27:12). The allotment of
      Issachar is described in Josh. 19:17-23. It included the
      plain of Esdraelon (=Jezreel), which was and still is the

      carried on by the Assyrians (Ezek. 27:6; Rev. 18:12). It
      was used by the Phoenicians to ornament the box-wood
      rowing-benches of their galleys, and Hiram&#39;s skilled
      workmen made Solomon&#39;s throne of ivory (1 Kings 10:18).
      It was brought by the caravans of Dedan (Isa. 21:13), and
      from the East Indies by the navy of Tarshish (1 Kings
      10:22). Many specimens of ancient Egyptian and Assyrian

      derived from the Sanscrit <i>ibhas</i>, meaning
      &quot;elephant,&quot; preceded by the Hebrew article (ha);
      and hence it is argued that Ophir, from which it and the

      connection with the vengeance taken on its inhabitants
      because they had refused to come up to Mizpeh to take part
      with Israel against the tribe of Benjamin (Judg. 21:8-14).
      After the battles at Gibeah, that tribe was almost
      extinguished, only six hundred men remaining. An expedition
      went against Jabesh-Gilead, the whole of whose inhabitants
      were put to the sword, except four hundred maidens, whom
      they brought as prisoners and sent to &quot;proclaim
      peace&quot; to the Benjamites who had fled to the crag
      Rimmon. These captives were given to them as wives, that
      the tribe might be saved from extinction (Judg. 21).</a>

    <p>
      This city was afterwards taken by Nahash, king of the

      king of Israel. In gratitude for this deliverance, forty
      years after this, the men of Jabesh-Gilead took down the
      bodies of Saul and of his three sons from the walls of
      Beth-shan, and after burning them, buried the bones under a
      tree near the city (1 Sam. 31:11-13). David thanked them
      for this act of piety (2 Sam. 2:4-6), and afterwards
      transferred the remains to the royal sepulchre (21:14). It
      is identified with the ruins of ed-Deir, about 6 miles

      against Joshua was the crowning act in the conquest of the
      land (11:21-23; comp. 14:6-15). This great battle, fought
      at Lake Merom, was the last of Joshua&#39;s battles of

      one hundred and sixty years after Joshua&#39;s death, and
      for twenty years held them in painful subjection. The whole
      population were paralyzed with fear, and gave way to
      hopeless despondency (Judg. 5:6-11), till Deborah and Barak
      aroused the national spirit, and gathering together ten
      thousand men, gained a great and decisive victory over
      Jabin in the plain of Esdraelon (Judg. 4:10-16; comp. Ps.

      another&#39;s heels; supplanter, (Gen. 25:26; 27:36; Hos.
      12:2-4), the second born of the twin sons of Isaac by
      Rebekah. He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father
      was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years
      old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle
      disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a
      shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising
      hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean
      selfishness and cunning (Gen. 25:29-34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother
      conspired to deceive the aged patriarch (Gen. 27), with the
      view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to
      himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1)
      superior rank in his family (Gen. 49:3); (2) a double
      portion of the paternal inheritance (Deut. 21:17); (3) the
      priestly office in the family (Num. 8:17-19); and (4) the
      promise of the Seed in which all nations of the earth were
      to be blessed (Gen. 22:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after his acquisition of his father&#39;s blessing
      (Gen. 27), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid
      of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac
      sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife
      among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28).
      There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to
      give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven
      years; but to Jacob these years &quot;seemed but a few
      days, for the love he had to her.&quot; But when the seven
      years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave
      him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to
      be completed probably before he obtained the beloved
      Rachel. But &quot;life-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials,
      in the retributive providence of God, followed as a
      consequence of this double union.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob
      desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of
      Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks
      (31:41). He then set out with his family and property
      &quot;to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan&quot;
      (Gen. 31). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set
      out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him
      in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After
      much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob,
      Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate
      farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in
      Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with
      Mesopotamia is at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of
      angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him
      back to the Land of Promise (32:1, 2). He called the name
      of the place Mahanaim, i.e., &quot;the double camp,&quot;
      probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of
      angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at
      Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary
      traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God
      ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to
      heaven (28:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother
      Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of
      mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now
      depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in
      earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent
      present to Esau, &quot;a present to my lord Esau from thy
      servant Jacob.&quot; Jacob&#39;s family were then
      transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained
      behind, spending the night in communion with God. While
      thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who
      wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob
      prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to
      Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this
      occured he called Peniel, &quot;for&quot;, said he, &quot;I
      have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved&quot;
      (32:25-31).
    </p>
    <p>
      After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting,
      mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the
      assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met
      him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the
      brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their
      lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief
      sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his
      tent near Shechem (q.v.), 33:18; but at length, under
      divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an
      altar unto God (35:6,7), and where God appeared to him and
      renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from
      Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem),
      Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin
      (35:16-20), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of
      Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre,
      to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete
      reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their
      uniting in the burial of the patriarch (35:27-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his
      beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers
      (37:33). Then follows the story of the famine, and the
      successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which
      led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the
      patriarch&#39;s going down with all his household,
      numbering about seventy souls (Ex. 1:5; Deut. 10:22; Acts
      7:14), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob,
      &quot;after being strangely tossed about on a very rough
      ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best
      affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely
      unfolded&quot; (Gen. 48). At length the end of his
      checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his
      bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he
      repeats the story of Rachel&#39;s death, although forty
      years had passed away since that event took place, as
      tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when
      &quot;he had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered
      up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost&quot;
      (49:33). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp
      into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in
      the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge.
      There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day
      (50:1-13). (See <a href=

      This is one of the few sites in Palestine about which there
      is no dispute. It was dug by Jacob, and hence its name, in
      the &quot;parcel of ground&quot; which he purchased from
      the sons of Hamor (Gen. 33:19). It still exists, but
      although after copious rains it contains a little water, it
      is now usually quite dry. It is at the entrance to the
      valley between Ebal and Gerizim, about 2 miles south-east
      of Shechem. It is about 9 feet in diameter and about 75
      feet in depth, though in ancient times it was no doubt much
      deeper, probably twice as deep. The digging of such a well
      must have been a very laborious and costly undertaking.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Unfortunately, the well of Jacob has not escaped that
      misplaced religious veneration which cannot be satisfied
      with leaving the object of it as it is, but must build over
      it a shrine to protect and make it sacred. A series of
      buildings of various styles, and of different ages, have
      cumbered the ground, choked up the well, and disfigured the
      natural beauty and simplicity of the spot. At present the
      rubbish in the well has been cleared out; but there is
      still a domed structure over it, and you gaze down the
      shaft cut in the living rock and see at a depth of 70 feet
      the surface of the water glimmering with a pale blue light
      in the darkness, while you notice how the limestone blocks
      that form its curb have been worn smooth, or else furrowed
      by the ropes of centuries&quot; (Hugh Macmillan).

      him to enter her tent. He did so, and as he lay wearied on
      the floor he fell into a deep sleep. She then took in her
      left hand one of the great wooden pins (&quot;nail&quot;)
      which fastened down the cords of the tent, and in her right
      hand the mallet, or &quot;hammer,&quot; used for driving it

      showed him what she had done. (See SISERA &macr;T0003452;

    <p>
      <a name="T0001965"><b>James -</b> (1.) The son of Zebedee
      and Salome; an elder brother of John the apostle. He was
      one of the twelve. He was by trade a fisherman, in
      partnership with Peter (Matt. 20:20; 27:56). With John and
      Peter he was present at the transfiguration (Matt. 17:1;
      Mark 9:2), at the raising of Jairus&#39;s daughter (Mark
      5:37-43), and in the garden with our Lord (14:33). Because,
      probably, of their boldness and energy, he and John were
      called Boanerges, i.e., &quot;sons of thunder.&quot; He was
      the first martyr among the apostles, having been beheaded
      by King Herod Agrippa (Acts 12:1, 2), A.D. 44. (Comp. Matt.
      4:21; 20:20-23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son of Alphaeus, or Cleopas, &quot;the
      brother&quot; or near kinsman or cousin of our Lord (Gal.
      1:18, 19), called James &quot;the Less,&quot; or &quot;the
      Little,&quot; probably because he was of low stature. He is
      mentioned along with the other apostles (Matt. 10:3; Mark
      3:18; Luke 6:15). He had a separate interview with our Lord
      after his resurrection (1 Cor. 15:7), and is mentioned as
      one of the apostles of the circumcision (Acts 1:13). He
      appears to have occupied the position of head of the Church
      at Jerusalem, where he presided at the council held to
      consider the case of the Gentiles (Acts 12:17; 15:13-29:
      21:18-24). This James was the author of the epistle which
      bears his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001966"><b>James, Epistle of -</b> (1.) Author
      of, was James the Less, the Lord&#39;s brother, one of the
      twelve apostles. He was one of the three pillars of the
      Church (Gal. 2:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) It was addressed to the Jews of the dispersion,
      &quot;the twelve tribes scattered abroad.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The place and time of the writing of the epistle were
      Jerusalem, where James was residing, and, from internal
      evidence, the period between Paul&#39;s two imprisonments
      at Rome, probably about A.D. 62.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The object of the writer was to enforce the practical
      duties of the Christian life. &quot;The Jewish vices
      against which he warns them are, formalism, which made the
      service of God consist in washings and outward ceremonies,
      whereas he reminds them (1:27) that it consists rather in
      active love and purity; fanaticism, which, under the cloak
      of religious zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces (1:20);
      fatalism, which threw its sins on God (1:13); meanness,
      which crouched before the rich (2:2); falsehood, which had
      made words and oaths play-things (3:2-12); partisanship
      (3:14); evil speaking (4:11); boasting (4:16); oppression
      (5:4). The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians
      is patience, patience in trial (1:2), patience in good
      works (1:22-25), patience under provocation (3:17),
      patience under oppression (5:7), patience under persecution
      (5:10); and the ground of their patience is that the coming
      of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong
      (5:8).&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Justification by works,&quot; which James contends
      for, is justification before man, the justification of our
      profession of faith by a consistent life. Paul contends for
      the doctrine of &quot;justification by faith;&quot; but
      that is justification before God, a being regarded and
      accepted as just by virtue of the righteousness of Christ,
      which is received by faith.

      <i>yaphah</i>, &quot;to be beautiful;&quot; hence white),
      one of the sons of Noah, mentioned last in order (Gen.
      5:32; 6:10; 7:13), perhaps first by birth (10:21; comp.
      9:24). He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the
      ark (1 Pet. 3:20). He was the progenitor of many tribes
      inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia (Gen.
      10:2-5). An act of filial piety (9:20-27) was the occasion
      of Noah&#39;s prophecy of the extension of his
      posterity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants
      of Noah, &quot;the sons of Japheth&quot; (Gen. 10:2),
      &quot;the sons of Ham&quot; (6), and &quot;the sons of
      Shem&quot; (22). It is important to notice that modern
      ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of
      facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a
      three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a
      remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the
      book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus
      distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian
      (Allophylian). &quot;Setting aside the cases where the
      ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it
      cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of Gen.
      10] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed
      together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and
      the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what
      has become known in modern times as the &#39;Indo-European
      Theory,&#39; or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic)
      race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the
      Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has
      thrown together under the one head of &#39;children of
      Shem&#39; the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the
      Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of
      the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under
      the heading of &#39;Semitic.&#39; Again, under the heading
      of &#39;sons of Ham,&#39; the author has arranged
      &#39;Cush&#39;, i.e., the Ethiopians; &#39;Mizraim,&#39;
      the people of Egypt; &#39;Sheba and Dedan,&#39; or certain
      of the Southern Arabs; and &#39;Nimrod,&#39; or the ancient
      people of Babylon, four races between which the latest
      linguistic researches have established a close

      <a name="T0001983"><b>Javan -</b> (1.) The fourth
      &quot;son&quot; of Japheth (Gen. 10:2), whose descendants
      settled in Greece, i.e., Ionia, which bears the name of
      Javan in Hebrew. Alexander the Great is called the
      &quot;king of Javan&quot; (rendered &quot;Grecia,&quot;
      Dan. 8:21; 10:20; comp. 11:2; Zech. 9:13). This word was
      universally used by the nations of the East as the generic
      name of the Greek race.</a>

    <p>
      (2.) A town or district of Arabia Felix, from which the
      Syrians obtained iron, cassia, and calamus (Ezek. 27:19).

      lance, from its flexibility (1 Sam. 18:10, 11; 19:9, 10;
      20:33).</a>

    <p>
      (2.) Heb. romah, a lance for heavy-armed troops, so called
      from its piercing (Num. 25:7). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0001985"><b>Jaw-bone -</b> of an ass afforded
      Samson a weapon for the great slaughter of the Philistines
      (Judg. 15.15), in which he slew a thousand men. In verse 19
      the Authorized Version reads, &quot;God clave a hollow
      place that was in the jaw, and there came water
      thereout.&quot; This is a mis-translation of the words. The
      rendering should be as in the Revised Version, &quot;God
      clave the hollow place that is in Lehi,&quot; etc., Lehi
      (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was
      waged, possibly so called because it was in shape like a
      jaw-bone.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001986"><b>Jealousy -</b> suspicion of a
      wife&#39;s purity, one of the strongest passions (Num.
      5:14; Prov. 6:34; Cant. 8:6); also an intense interest for
      another&#39;s honour or prosperity (Ps. 79:5; 1 Cor. 10:22;
      Zech. 1:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001987"><b>Jealousy, Image of -</b> an
      idolatrous object, seen in vision by Ezekiel (Ezek. 8:3,
      5), which stood in the priests&#39; or inner court of the
      temple. Probably identical with the statue of Astarte (2
      Kings 21:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001988"><b>Jealousy offering -</b> the name of
      the offering the husband was to bring when he charged his
      wife with adultery (Num. 5:11-15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001989"><b>Jealousy, Waters of -</b> water which
      the suspected wife was required to drink, so that the
      result might prove her guilt or innocence (Num. 5:12-17,
      27). We have no record of this form of trial having been
      actually resorted to.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001990"><b>Jearim -</b> forests, a mountain on
      the border of Judah (Josh. 15:10).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001991"><b>Jebus -</b> trodden hard, or
      fastness, or &quot;the waterless hill&quot;, the name of
      the Canaanitish city which stood on Mount Zion (Josh. 15:8;
      18:16, 28). It is identified with Jerusalem (q.v.) in Judg.
      19:10, and with the castle or city of David (1 Chr.
      11:4,5). It was a place of great natural strength, and its
      capture was one of David&#39;s most brilliant achievements
      (2 Sam. 5:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001992"><b>Jebusites -</b> the name of the
      original inhabitants of Jebus, mentioned frequently among
      the seven nations doomed to destruction (Gen. 10:16; 15:21;
      Ex. 3:8, 17; 13:5, etc.). At the time of the arrival of the
      Israelites in Palestine they were ruled by Adonizedek
      (Josh. 10:1, 23). They were defeated by Joshua, and their
      king was slain; but they were not entirely driven out of
      Jebus till the time of David, who made it the capital of
      his kingdom instead of Hebron. The site on which the temple
      was afterwards built belonged to Araunah, a Jebusite, from
      whom it was purchased by David, who refused to accept it as
      a free gift (2 Sam. 24:16-25; 1 Chr. 21:24, 25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001993"><b>Jecoliah -</b> able through Jehovah,
      the wife of King Amaziah, and mother of King Uzziah (2 Chr.
      26:3).</a>

      <a name="T0001994"><b>Jedaiah -</b> (1.) Invoker of
      Jehovah. The son of Shimri, a chief Simeonite (1 Chr.
      4:37).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem after
      the return from Babylon (Neh. 3:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Knowing Jehovah. The chief of one of the courses of
      the priests (1 Chr. 24:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A priest in Jerusalem after the Exile (1 Chr. 9:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001995"><b>Jediael -</b> known by God. (1.) One
      of the sons of Benjamin, whose descendants numbered 17,200
      warriors (1 Chr. 7:6, 10, 11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Shimrite, one of David&#39;s bodyguard (1 Chr.
      11:45). Probably same as in 12:20.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A Korhite of the family of Ebiasaph, and one of the
      gate-keepers to the temple (1 Chr. 26:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001996"><b>Jedidiah -</b> beloved by Jehovah,
      the name which, by the mouth of Nathan, the Lord gave to
      Solomon at his birth as a token of the divine favour (2
      Sam. 12:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001997"><b>Jeduthun -</b> lauder; praising, a
      Levite of the family of Merari, and one of the three
      masters of music appointed by David (1 Chr. 16:41, 42;
      25:1-6). He is called in 2 Chr. 35:15 &quot;the king&#39;s
      seer.&quot; His descendants are mentioned as singers and
      players on instruments (Neh. 11:17). He was probably the
      same as Ethan (1 Chr. 15:17, 19). In the superscriptions to
      Ps. 39, 62, and 77, the words &quot;upon Jeduthun&quot;
      probably denote a musical instrument; or they may denote
      the style or tune invented or introduced by Jeduthun, or
      that the psalm was to be sung by his choir.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0001998"><b>Jegar-sahadutha -</b> pile of
      testimony, the Aramaic or Syriac name which Laban gave to
      the pile of stones erected as a memorial of the covenant
      between him and Jacob (Gen. 31:47), who, however, called it
      in Hebrew by an equivalent name, Galeed (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0001999"><b>Jehaleleel -</b> praiser of God. (1.)
      A descendant of Judah (1 Chr. 4:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite of the family of Merari (2 Chr. 29:12).
