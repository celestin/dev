      <a name="T0002000"><b>Jehdeiah -</b> rejoicer in Jehovah.
      (1.) One of the Levitical attendants at the temple, a

    </p>

      the close of his reign (1 Chr. 27:32).

      Hezekiah in his work of reformation (2 Chr. 29:14).

    </p>
    <p>
      (9.) One of the &quot;sons&quot; of Elam (Ezra 10:26).

    <p>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002002"><b>Jehizkiah -</b> Jehovah strengthens,
      one of the chiefs of Ephraim (2 Chr. 28:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002003"><b>Jehoaddan -</b> Jehovah his ornament,
      the wife of King Jehoash, and mother of King Amaziah (2
      Kings 14:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002004"><b>Jehoahaz -</b> Jehovah his sustainer,
      or he whom Jehovah holdeth. (1.) The youngest son of
      Jehoram, king of Judah (2 Chr. 21:17; 22:1, 6, 8, 9);
      usually Ahaziah (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son and successor of Jehu, king of Israel (2 Kings
      10:35). He reigned seventeen years, and followed the evil
      ways of the house of Jeroboam. The Syrians, under Hazael
      and Benhadad, prevailed over him, but were at length driven
      out of the land by his son Jehoash (13:1-9, 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Josiah&#39;s third son, usually called Shallum (1 Chr.
      3:15). He succeeded his father on the throne, and reigned
      over Judah for three months (2 Kings 23:31, 34). He fell
      into the idolatrous ways of his predecessors (23:32), was
      deposed by Pharaoh-Necho from the throne, and carried away
      prisoner into Egypt, where he died in captivity (23:33, 34;
      Jer. 22:10-12; 2 Chr. 36:1-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002005"><b>Jehoash -</b> Jehovah-given. (1.) The
      son of King Ahaziah. While yet an infant, he was saved from
      the general massacre of the family by his aunt Jehosheba,
      and was apparently the only surviving descendant of Solomon
      (2 Chr. 21:4, 17). His uncle, the high priest Jehoiada,
      brought him forth to public notice when he was eight years
      of age, and crowned and anointed him king of Judah with the
      usual ceremonies. Athaliah was taken by surprise when she
      heard the shout of the people, &quot;Long live the
      king;&quot; and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada
      commanded her to be led forth to death (2 Kings 11:13-20).
      While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship
      of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away
      into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry.
      Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was
      put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the
      judgement of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian
      invaders. He is one of the three kings omitted by Matthew
      (1:8) in the genealogy of Christ, the other two being
      Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the city of David (2
      Kings 12:21). (See JOASH &macr;T0002078 [4].)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son and successor of Jehoahaz, king of Israel (2
      Kings 14:1; comp. 12:1; 13:10). When he ascended the throne
      the kingdom was suffering from the invasion of the Syrians.
      Hazael &quot;was cutting Israel short.&quot; He tolerated
      the worship of the golden calves, yet seems to have
      manifested a character of sincere devotion to the God of
      his fathers. He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept
      by his bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the
      words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up
      into heaven: &quot;O my father, my father, the chariot of
      Israel and the horsemen thereof.&quot; He was afterwards
      involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah (2 Chr.
      25:23-24), whom he utterly defeated at Beth-shemesh, on the
      borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on Jerusalem,
      broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the
      treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died
      (B.C. 825), and was buried in Samaria (2 Kings 14:1-17, 19,
      20). He was succeeded by his son. (See JOASH &macr;T0002078
      [5.].)

    <p>
      <a name="T0002006"><b>Jehohanan -</b> Jehovah-granted,
      Jeroboam II. (1.) A Korhite, the head of one of the
      divisions of the temple porters (1 Chr. 26:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of Jehoshaphat&#39;s &quot;captains&quot; (2 Chr.
      17:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The father of Azariah (2 Chr. 28:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The son of Tobiah, an enemy of the Jews (Neh. 6:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Neh. 12:42.
    </p>

      (6.) Neh. 12:13.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002007"><b>Jehoiachin -</b> succeeded his father
      Jehoiakin (B.C. 599) when only eight years of age, and
      reigned for one hundred days (2 Chr. 36:9). He is also
      called Jeconiah (Jer. 24:1; 27:20, etc.), and Coniah
      (22:24; 37:1). He was succeeded by his uncle, Mattaniah =
      Zedekiah (q.v.). He was the last direct heir to the Jewish
      crown. He was carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar,
      along with the flower of the nobility, all the leading men
      in Jerusalem, and a great body of the general population,
      some thirteen thousand in all (2 Kings 24:12-16; Jer.
      52:28). After an imprisonment of thirty-seven years (Jer.
      52:31, 33), he was liberated by Evil-merodach, and
      permitted to occupy a place in the king&#39;s household and
      sit at his table, receiving &quot;every day a portion until
      the day of his death, all the days of his life&quot;
      (52:32-34).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002008"><b>Jehoiada -</b> Jehovah-known. (1.)
      The father of Benaiah, who was one of David&#39;s chief
      warriors (2 Sam. 8:18; 20:23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The high priest at the time of Athaliah&#39;s
      usurpation of the throne of Judah. He married Jehosheba, or
      Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram (2 Chr. 22:11),
      and took an active part along with his wife in the
      preservation and training of Jehoash when Athaliah slew all
      the royal family of Judah.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plans he adopted in replacing Jehoash on the throne of
      his ancestors are described in 2 Kings 11:2; 12:2; 2 Chr.
      22:11; 23:24. He was among the foremost of the benefactors
      of the kingdom, and at his death was buried in the city of
      David among the kings of Judah (2 Chr. 24:15, 16). He is
      said to have been one hundred and thirty years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002009"><b>Jehoiakim -</b> he whom Jehovah has
      set up, the second son of Josiah, and eighteenth king of
      Judah, which he ruled over for eleven years (B.C. 610-599).
      His original name was Eliakim (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the death of his father his younger brother Jehoahaz
      (=Shallum, Jer. 22:11), who favoured the Chaldeans against
      the Egyptians, was made king by the people; but the king of
      Egypt, Pharaoh-necho, invaded the land and deposed Jehoahaz
      (2 Kings 23:33, 34; Jer. 22:10-12), setting Eliakim on the
      throne in his stead, and changing his name to Jehoiakim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the king of Egypt took no part in Jewish
      politics, having been defeated by the Chaldeans at
      Carchemish (2 Kings 24:7; Jer. 46:2). Palestine was now
      invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim was
      taken prisoner and carried captive to Babylon (2 Chr. 36:6,
      7). It was at this time that Daniel also and his three
      companions were taken captive to Babylon (Dan. 1:1, 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nebuchadnezzar reinstated Jehoiakim on his throne, but
      treated him as a vassal king. In the year after this,
      Jeremiah caused his prophecies to be read by Baruch in the
      court of the temple. Jehoiakim, hearing of this, had them
      also read in the royal palace before himself. The words
      displeased him, and taking the roll from the hands of
      Baruch he cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire (Jer.
      36:23). During his disastrous reign there was a return to
      the old idolatry and corruption of the days of Manasseh.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three years of subjection to Babylon, Jehoiakim
      withheld his tribute and threw off the yoke (2 Kings 24:1),
      hoping to make himself independent. Nebuchadnezzar sent
      bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, and Ammonites (2 Kings 24:2)
      to chastise his rebellious vassal. They cruelly harassed
      the whole country (comp. Jer. 49:1-6). The king came to a
      violent death, and his body having been thrown over the
      wall of Jerusalem, to convince the beseieging army that he
      was dead, after having been dragged away, was buried beyond
      the gates of Jerusalem &quot;with the burial of an
      ass,&quot; B.C. 599 (Jer. 22:18, 19; 36:30). Nebuchadnezzar
      placed his son Jehoiachin on the throne, wishing still to
      retain the kingdom of Judah as tributary to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002010"><b>Jehoiarib -</b> Jehovah defends, a
      priest at Jerusalem, head of one of the sacerdotal courses
      (1 Chr. 9:10; 24:7). His &quot;course&quot; went up from
      Babylon after the Exile (Ezra 2:36-39; Neh. 7:39-42).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002011"><b>Jehonadab -</b> Jehovah is liberal;
      or, whom Jehovah impels. (1.) A son of Shimeah, and nephew
      of David. It was he who gave the fatal wicked advice to
      Amnon, the heir to the throne (2 Sam. 13:3-6). He was very
      &quot;subtil,&quot; but unprincipled.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A son of Rechab, the founder of a tribe who bound
      themselves by a vow to abstain from wine (Jer. 35:6-19).
      There were different settlements of Rechabites (Judg. 1:16;
      4:11; 1 Chr. 2:55). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003000.html&amp;from=T0003080&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      RECHABITE</a>.) His interview and alliance with Jehu are
      mentioned in 2 Kings 10:15-23. He went with Jehu in his
      chariot to Samaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002012"><b>Jehonathan -</b> whom Jehovah gave.
      (1.) One of the stewards of David&#39;s store-houses (1
      Chr. 27:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite who taught the law to the people of Judah (2
      Chr. 17:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Neh. 12:18.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002013"><b>Jehoram -</b> Jehovah-exalted. (1.)
      Son of Toi, king of Hamath, sent by his father to
      congratulate David on the occasion of his victory over
      Hadadezer (2 Sam. 8:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite of the family of Gershom (1 Chr. 26:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A priest sent by Jehoshaphat to instructruct the
      people in Judah (2 Chr. 17:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The son of Ahab and Jezebel, and successor to his
      brother Ahaziah on the throne of Israel. He reigned twelve
      years, B.C. 896-884 (2 Kings 1:17; 3:1). His first work was
      to reduce to subjection the Moabites, who had asserted
      their independence in the reign of his brother.
      Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, assisted Jehoram in this
      effort. He was further helped by his ally the king of Edom.
      Elisha went forth with the confederated army (2 Kings
      3:1-19), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouraged
      the army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy
      victory. The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly
      routed and their cities destroyed. At Kir-haraseth Mesha
      made a final stand. The Israelites refrained from pressing
      their victory further, and returned to their own land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisha afterwards again befriended Jehoram when a war broke
      out between the Syrians and Israel, and in a remarkable way
      brought that war to a bloodless close (2 Kings 6:23). But
      Jehoram, becoming confident in his own power, sank into
      idolatry, and brought upon himself and his land another
      Syrian invasion, which led to great suffering and distress
      in Samaria (2 Kings 6:24-33). By a remarkable providential
      interposition the city was saved from utter destruction,
      and the Syrians were put to flight (2 Kings 7:6-15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehoram was wounded in a battle with the Syrians at Ramah,
      and obliged to return to Jezreel (2 Kings 8:29; 9:14, 15),
      and soon after the army proclaimed their leader Jehu king
      of Israel, and revolted from their allegiance to Jehoram (2
      Kings 9). Jehoram was pierced by an arrow from Jehu&#39;s
      bow on the piece of ground at Jezreel which Ahab had taken
      from Naboth, and there he died (2 Kings 9:21-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The eldest son and successor of Jehoshaphat, king of
      Judah. He reigned eight years (B.C. 892-885) alone as king
      of Judah, having been previously for some years associated
      with his father (2 Chr. 21:5, 20; 2 Kings 8:16). His wife
      was Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. His
      daughter Jehosheba was married to the high priest Jehoiada.
      He sank into gross idolatry, and brought upon himself and
      his kingdom the anger of Jehovah. The Edomites revolted
      from under his yoke, and the Philistines and the Arabians
      and Cushites invaded the land, and carried away great
      spoil, along with Jehoram&#39;s wives and all his children,
      except Ahaziah. He died a painful death from a fearful
      malady, and was refused a place in the sepulchre of the
      kings (2 Kings 8:16-24; 2 Chr. 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002014"><b>Jehoshaphat -</b> Jehovah-judged.
      (1.) One of David&#39;s body-guard (1 Chr. 11:43).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) One of the priests who accompanied the removal of the
      ark to Jerusalem (1 Chr. 15:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Son of Ahilud, &quot;recorder&quot; or annalist under
      David and Solomon (2 Sam. 8:16), a state officer of high
      rank, chancellor or vizier of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Solomon&#39;s purveyor in Issachar (1 Kings 4:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The son and successor of Asa, king of Judah. After
      fortifying his kingdom against Israel (2 Chr. 17:1, 2), he
      set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry (1 Kings
      22:43). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests
      and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law
      (2 Chr. 17:7-9). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and
      prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people
      &quot;in their basket and their store.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great mistake of his reign was his entering into an
      alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him
      in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom (1
      Kings 22:1-33). Escaping from the bloody battle of
      Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu (2 Chr. 19:1-3) reproached
      him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he
      entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to
      all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of
      God and in the righteous government of the people (2 Chr.
      19:4-11).

      Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of
      Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce
      with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at
      Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted
      out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and
      although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted (2
      Chr. 20:35-37; 1 Kings 22:48-49).
    </p>
    <p>
      He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war
      against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel.
      This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the
      dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice
      on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of
      Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned
      to his own land (2 Kings 3:4-27).
    </p>
    <p>
      The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded
      in 2 Chr. 20. The Moabites formed a great and powerful
      confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against
      Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The
      king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook
      themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court
      of the temple, &quot;O our God, wilt thou not judge them?
      for we have no might against this great company that cometh
      against us.&quot; Amid the silence that followed, the voice
      of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the
      morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was,
      for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another,
      leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich
      spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great
      deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after
      this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years,
      being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son
      Jehoram (1 Kings 22:50). He had this testimony, that
      &quot;he sought the Lord with all his heart&quot; (2 Chr.
      22:9). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than
      under his reign.

      <a name="T0002015"><b>Jehoshaphat, Valley of -</b>
      mentioned in Scripture only in Joel 3:2, 12. This is the
      name given in modern times to the valley between Jerusalem
      and the Mount of Olives, and the Kidron flows through it.
      Here Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederated enemies of
      Israel (Ps. 83:6-8); and in this valley also God was to
      overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, etc. (Joel 3:4, 19), with
      an utter overthrow. This has been fulfilled; but Joel
      speaks of the final conflict, when God would destroy all
      Jerusalem&#39;s enemies, of whom Tyre and Zidon, etc., were
      types. The &quot;valley of Jehoshaphat&quot; may therefore
      be simply regarded as a general term for the theatre of
      God&#39;s final judgments on the enemies of Israel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This valley has from ancient times been used by the Jews as
      a burial-ground. It is all over paved with flat stones as
      tombstones, bearing on them Hebrew inscriptions.

      daughter of Jehoram, the king of Israel. She is called
      Jehoshabeath in 2 Chr. 22:11. She was the only princess of
      the royal house who was married to a high priest, Jehoiada
      (2 Chr. 22:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002017"><b>Jehovah -</b> the special and
      significant name (not merely an appellative title such as
      Lord [adonai]) by which God revealed himself to the ancient
      Hebrews (Ex. 6:2, 3). This name, the Tetragrammaton of the
      Greeks, was held by the later Jews to be so sacred that it
      was never pronounced except by the high priest on the great
      Day of Atonement, when he entered into the most holy place.
      Whenever this name occurred in the sacred books they
      pronounced it, as they still do, &quot;Adonai&quot; (i.e.,
      Lord), thus using another word in its stead. The Massorets
      gave to it the vowel-points appropriate to this word. This
      Jewish practice was founded on a false interpretation of
      Lev. 24:16. The meaning of the word appears from Ex. 3:14
      to be &quot;the unchanging, eternal, self-existent
      God,&quot; the &quot;I am that I am,&quot; a
      convenant-keeping God. (Comp. Mal. 3:6; Hos. 12:5; Rev.
      1:4, 8.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew name &quot;Jehovah&quot; is generally translated
      in the Authorized Version (and the Revised Version has not
      departed from this rule) by the word LORD printed in small
      capitals, to distinguish it from the rendering of the
      Hebrew <i>Adonai</i> and the Greek <i>Kurios</i>, which are
      also rendered Lord, but printed in the usual type. The
      Hebrew word is translated &quot;Jehovah&quot; only in Ex.
      6:3; Ps. 83:18; Isa. 12:2; 26:4, and in the compound names
      mentioned below.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of notice that this name is never used in the
      LXX., the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Apocrypha, or in the
      New Testament. It is found, however, on the &quot;Moabite
      stone&quot; (q.v.), and consequently it must have been in
      the days of Mesba so commonly pronounced by the Hebrews as
      to be familiar to their heathen neighbours.

    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat (2 Kings 9:2),
      and grandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the
      throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war
      against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more
      troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead
      Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving
      his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally,
      Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of
      sympathy with him (2 Kings 8:28, 29). The commanders, being
      left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council;
      and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from
      Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the
      council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed
      him king over Israel, and immediately retired and
      disappeared (2 Kings 9:5, 6). On being interrogated by his
      companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he
      informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with
      the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and
      proclaimed him king (2 Kings 9:11-14). He then with a
      chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where,
      with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through
      the heart with an arrow (9:24). The king of Judah, when
      trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu&#39;s
      soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded
      the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into
      the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot
      by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he
      communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the
      capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow
      with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria.
      Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in
      two heaps at his gate. At &quot;the shearing-house&quot; (2
      Kings 10:12-14) other forty-two connected with the house of
      Ahab were put to death (2 Kings 10:14). As Jehu rode on
      toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into
      his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a
      cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal
      found in Samaria (2 Kings 10:19-25), and destroyed the
      temple of the idol (2 Kings 10:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of
      Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden
      calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure
      rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war
      with the Syrians (2 Kings 10:29-33). He died after a reign
      of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in
      Samaria (10:34-36). &quot;He was one of those decisive,
      terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and
      passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to
      change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the
      earth.&quot; He was the first Jewish king who came in
      contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser

      been described as &quot;a wild, daring, Gilead mountaineer,
      a sort of warrior Elijah.&quot; After forty-five years of
      comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in
      &quot;process of time the children of Ammon made war
      against Israel&quot; (11:5). In their distress the elders
      of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to
      which he had fled when driven out wrongfully by his
      brothers from his father&#39;s inheritance (2), and the
      people made him their head and captain. The &quot;elders of
      Gilead&quot; in their extremity summoned him to their aid,
      and he at once undertook the conduct of the war against
      Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the king of Ammon, but
      in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his summons,
      and &quot;the spirit of the Lord came upon him.&quot;
      Before engaging in war he vowed that if successful he would
      offer as a &quot;burnt-offering&quot; whatever would come
      out of the door of his house first to meet him on his
      return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. &quot;He
      smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even
      twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards [Heb.
      &#39;Abel Keramim], with a very great slaughter&quot;
      (Judg. 11:33). The men of Ephraim regarded themselves as
      insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to go with
      him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men
      of Gilead and Ephraim (12:4), in which many of the
      Ephraimites perished. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0002031"><b>Jephthah&#39;s vow -</b> (Judg.
      11:30, 31). After a crushing defeat of the Ammonites,
      Jephthah returned to his own house, and the first to
      welcome him was his own daughter. This was a terrible blow
      to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, &quot;Alas,
      my daughter! thou hast brought me very low...I have opened
      my mouth unto the Lord, and cannot go back.&quot; With
      singular nobleness of spirit she answered, &quot;Do to me
      according to that which hath proceeded out of thy
      mouth.&quot; She only asked two months to bewail her
      maidenhood with her companions upon the mountains. She
      utters no reproach against her father&#39;s rashness, and
      is content to yield her life since her father has returned
      a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his
      daughter as a &quot;burnt-offering&quot;? This question has
      been much debated, and there are many able commentators who
      argue that such a sacrifice was actually offered. We are
      constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah&#39;s
      known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident
      acquaintance with the law of Moses, to which such
      sacrifices were abhorrent (Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut.
      12:31), and the place he holds in the roll of the heroes of

      when still young (1:6), in the thirteenth year of Josiah

      Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of
      reformation (2 Kings 23:1-25). The death of this pious king
      was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity (2 Chr.
      35:25).

    <p>
      During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no
      reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of
      Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in
      bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under
      restraint (Jer. 36:5). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he
      was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to
      read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by
      Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public
      excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his
      recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and
      cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah
      to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and
      wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed,
      and &quot;many like words&quot; besides (Jer. 36:32).
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his
      words of warning, but without effect. He was there when
      Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city (Jer. 37:4, 5), B.C. 589.
      The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews
      in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return
      to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The
      prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from
      God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take
      the city, and burn it with fire (37:7, 8). The princes, in
      their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into
      prison (37:15-38:13). He was still in confinement when the
      city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and
      showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place
      of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with
      Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan
      succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to
      Jeremiah&#39;s counsels, went down into Egypt, taking
      Jeremiah and Baruch with him (Jer. 43:6). There probably
      the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain
      seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom
      they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of
      Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been
      about ninety years of age at his death. We have no
      authentic record of his death. He may have died at
      Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to
      Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there
      is nothing certain.

      In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have
      added three sections, viz., ch. 37-39; 40-43; and 44.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal Messianic prophecies are found in 23:1-8;
      31:31-40; and 33:14-26.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah&#39;s prophecies are noted for the frequent
      repetitions found in them of the same words and phrases and
      imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are
      not recorded in the order of time. When and under what
      circumstances this book assumed its present form we know
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LXX. Version of this book is, in its arrangement and in
      other particulars, singularly at variance with the
      original. The LXX. omits 10:6-8; 27:19-22; 29:16-20;
      33:14-26; 39:4-13; 52:2, 3, 15, 28-30, etc. About 2,700
      words in all of the original are omitted. These omissions,
      etc., are capricious and arbitrary, and render the version
      unreliable.

      <a name="T0002036"><b>Jericho -</b> place of fragrance, a
      fenced city in the midst of a vast grove of palm trees, in
      the plain of Jordan, over against the place where that
      river was crossed by the Israelites (Josh. 3:16). Its site
      was near the &#39;Ain es-Sultan, Elisha&#39;s Fountain (2
      Kings 2:19-22), about 5 miles west of Jordan. It was the
      most important city in the Jordan valley (Num. 22:1;
      34:15), and the strongest fortress in all the land of
      Canaan. It was the key to Western Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by the
      Israelites (Josh. 6). God gave it into their hands. The
      city was &quot;accursed&quot; (Heb. herem,
      &quot;devoted&quot; to Jehovah), and accordingly (Josh.
      6:17; comp. Lev. 27:28, 29; Deut. 13:16) all the
      inhabitants and all the spoil of the city were to be
      destroyed, &quot;only the silver, and the gold, and the
      vessels of brass and of iron&quot; were reserved and
      &quot;put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah&quot;
      (Josh. 6:24; comp. Num. 31:22, 23, 50-54). Only Rahab
      &quot;and her father&#39;s household, and all that she
      had,&quot; were preserved from destruction, according to
      the promise of the spies (Josh. 2:14). In one of the Amarna
      tablets Adoni-zedec (q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt
      informing him that the &#39;Abiri (Hebrews) had prevailed,
      and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were plundering
      &quot;all the king&#39;s lands.&quot; It would seem that
      the Egyptian troops had before this been withdrawn from
      Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      This city was given to the tribe of Benjamin (Josh. 18:21),
      and it was inhabited in the time of the Judges (Judg. 3:13;
      2 Sam. 10:5). It is not again mentioned till the time of
      David (2 Sam. 10:5). &quot;Children of Jericho&quot; were
      among the captives who returned under Zerubbabel Ezra 2:34;
      Neh. 7:36). Hiel (q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it
      once more a fortified city (1 Kings 16:34). Between the
      beginning and the end of his undertaking all his children
      were cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      In New Testament times Jericho stood some distance to the
      south-east of the ancient one, and near the opening of the
      valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing town, having
      a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees
      which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord
      on his last journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two
      blind men (Matt. 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52), and brought
      salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican (Luke
      19:2-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modern
      Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east. It
      is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the
      Turks in 1840. &quot;The soil of the plain,&quot; about the
      middle of which the ancient city stood, &quot;is
      unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of water for
      irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost
      perfect; yet nearly the whole plain is waste and
      desolate...The climate of Jericho is exceedingly hot and
      unhealthy. This is accounted for by the depression of the
      plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of the
      sea.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three different Jerichos, on three different
      sites, the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the
      Jericho of the Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates
      from the time of the Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a
      hollow scooped out for some purpose or other near the foot
      of the biggest mound above the Sultan&#39;s Spring
      specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely
      identical with what he had discovered on the site of
      ancient Lachish. He also traced in this place for a short
      distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he supposes to be
      the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua. The
      wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of
      Quarantania and its numerous caverns, and the spies of
      Joshua could easily have fled from the city and been
      speedily hidden in these fastnesses.

      people. (1.) The son of Nebat (1 Kings 11:26-39), &quot;an
      Ephrathite,&quot; the first king of the ten tribes, over
      whom he reigned twenty-two years (B.C. 976-945). He was the
      son of a widow of Zereda, and while still young was
      promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the
      &quot;burnden&quot;, i.e., of the bands of forced
      labourers. Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah,
      he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming
      king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered,
      he fled to Egypt (1 Kings 11:29-40), where he remained for
      a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the
      death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to
      invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam
      favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly
      proclaimed &quot;king of Israel&quot; (1 Kings 12: 1-20).
      He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his
      kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the
      division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom,
      and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his
      kingdom, &quot;golden calves,&quot; which he set up as
      symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go
      up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to
      the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as
      the man &quot;who made Israel to sin.&quot; This policy was
      followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a
      prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning
      message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for
      his bold words of defiance, his hand was &quot;dried
      up,&quot; and the altar before which he stood was rent
      asunder. At his urgent entreaty his &quot;hand was restored
      him again&quot; (1 Kings 13:1-6, 9; comp. 2 Kings 23:15);
      but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. His
      reign was one of constant war with the house of Judah. He
      died soon after his son Abijah (1 Kings 14:1-18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Jeroboam II., the son and successor of Jehoash, and
      the fourteenth king of Israel, over which he ruled for
      forty-one years, B.C. 825-784 (2 Kings 14:23). He followed
      the example of the first Jeroboam in keeping up the worship
      of the golden calves (2 Kings 14:24). His reign was
      contemporary with those of Amaziah (2 Kings 14:23) and
      Uzziah (15:1), kings of Judah. He was victorious over the
      Syrians (13:4; 14:26, 27), and extended Israel to its
      former limits, from &quot;the entering of Hamath to the sea
      of the plain&quot; (14:25; Amos 6:14). His reign of
      forty-one years was the most prosperous that Israel had
      ever known as yet. With all this outward prosperity,
      however, iniquity widely prevailed in the land (Amos 2:6-8;
      4:1; 6:6; Hos. 4:12-14). The prophets Hosea (1:1), Joel
      (3:16; Amos 1:1, 2), Amos (1:1), and Jonah (2 Kings 14:25)
      lived during his reign. He died, and was buried with his
      ancestors (14:29). He was succeeded by his son Zachariah
      (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      His name occurs in Scripture only in 2 Kings 13:13; 14:16,
      23, 27, 28, 29; 15:1, 8; 1 Chr. 5:17; Hos. 1:1; Amos 1:1;
      7:9, 10, 11. In all other passages it is Jeroboam the son
      of Nebat that is meant.

      city;&quot; by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning &quot;the
      holy;&quot; once &quot;the city of Judah&quot; (2 Chr.
      25:28). This name is in the original in the dual form, and
      means &quot;possession of peace,&quot; or &quot;foundation
      of peace.&quot; The dual form probably refers to the two
      mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or,
      as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the
      &quot;upper&quot; and the &quot;lower city.&quot; Jerusalem
      is a &quot;mountain city enthroned on a mountain
      fastness&quot; (comp. Ps. 68:15, 16; 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2;
      122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest
      table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the
      south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep
      and precipitous ravines.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem
      (Gen. 14:18; comp. Ps. 76:2). When first mentioned under
      the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king (Josh. 10:1).
      It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin (Judg.
      19:10; 1 Chr. 11:4); but in the time of David it was
      divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of
      Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of
      Judah (Judg. 1:1-8); but the Jebusites were not wholly
      driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we
      are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither (1
      Sam. 17:54). David afterwards led his forces against the
      Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them
      out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called
      &quot;the city of David&quot; (2 Sam. 5:5-9; 1 Chr.
      11:4-8). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the
      threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite (2 Sam. 24:15-25),
      and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and
      placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for
      it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house
      for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He
      also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it
      became the great centre of all the civil and religious
      affairs of the nation (Deut. 12:5; comp. 12:14; 14:23;
      16:11-16; Ps. 122).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the
      throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became
      the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was
      subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the
      Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel (2 Kings 14:13, 14;
      18:15, 16; 23:33-35; 24:14; 2 Chr. 12:9; 26:9; 27:3, 4;
      29:3; 32:30; 33:11), till finally, for the abounding
      iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it
      was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the
      ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by
      Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (2 Kings 25; 2 Chr. 36;
      Jer. 39), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land
      was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into
      Egypt (Jer. 40-44), and by the final carrying captive into
      Babylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so
      that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare
      the predictions, Deut. 28; Lev. 26:14-39.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be
      built, in troublous times (Dan. 9:16, 19, 25), after a
      captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C.
      536, &quot;in the first year of Cyrus&quot; (Ezra 1:2, 3,
      5-11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history
      of the re-building of the city and temple, and the
      restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a
      portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was
      for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C.
      331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under
      the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For
      a century the Jews maintained their independence under
      native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this
      period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of
      his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of
      the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then
      laid in ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the
      immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the
      ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same
      site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its
      streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till
      A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem
      quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the
      emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection,
      rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took
      possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one
      Bar-Chohaba (i.e., &quot;the son of the star&quot;) in
      revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D.
      135), however, they were driven out of it with great
      slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its
      ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a
      name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of
      the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e.,
      &quot;the holy.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made
      a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the
      places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a
      church to be built on what was then supposed to be the
      place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated
      by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built
      over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was
      completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws
      against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted
      them once a year to visit the city and wail over the
      desolation of &quot;the holy and beautiful house.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces
      of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and
      retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the
      Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their
      possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion
      of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under
      the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of
      Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great
      slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted
      the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the
      eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and
      convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the
      Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone
      remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin
      wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the
      present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in
      the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that
      period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished
      in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having
      passed through so many vicissitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in
      Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of
      what are called the &quot;holy places.&quot; In this
      dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the
      Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with
      the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the
      question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this
      there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and
      sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way
      of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern Jerusalem &quot;lies near the summit of a broad
      mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the
      plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end
      of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the
      Mediterranean.&quot; This high, uneven table-land is
      everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It
      was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely
      from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in
      mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but
      because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental
      custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem
      every form of religion, every nationality of East and West,
      is represented at one time.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of
      Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets
      includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt,
      recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name
      is there spelt Uru-Salim (&quot;city of peace&quot;).
      Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named
      is that of Sennacherib&#39;s attack in B.C. 702. The
      &quot;camp of the Assyrians&quot; was still shown about
      A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in
      the new quarter of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city of David included both the upper city and Millo,
      and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon,
      who appear to have restored the original Jebusite
      fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have
      been, like Ariel (&quot;the hearth of God&quot;), a
      poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more
      specially used of the Temple hill. The priests&#39; quarter
      grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was
      Solomon&#39;s Palace outside the original city of David.
      The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh
      to include this suburb and the Temple (2 Chr. 27:3; 33:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with
      ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but
      extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as
      a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries
      A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation
      have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the
      limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls
      having been traced.

      youngest of whom was David (1 Sam. 17:12). The phrase
      &quot;stem of Jesse&quot; is used for the family of David
      (Isa. 11:1), and &quot;root of Jesse&quot; for the Messiah
      (Isa. 11:10; Rev. 5:5). Jesse was a man apparently of

      Je&#39;sus, the proper, as Christ is the official, name of
      our Lord. To distinguish him from others so called, he is
      spoken of as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (John 18:7), and
      &quot;Jesus the son of Joseph&quot; (John 6:42).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua, which was
      originally Hoshea (Num. 13:8, 16), but changed by Moses
      into Jehoshua (Num. 13:16; 1 Chr. 7:27), or Joshua. After
      the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whence the Greek form
      Jesus. It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his
      mission, to save (Matt. 1:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great
      periods, (1) that of his private life, till he was about
      thirty years of age; and (2) that of his public life, which
      lasted about three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the &quot;fulness of time&quot; he was born at
      Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary,
      who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter (Matt. 1:1; Luke
      3:23; comp. John 7:42). His birth was announced to the
      shepherds (Luke 2:8-20). Wise men from the east came to
      Bethlehem to see him who was born &quot;King of the
      Jews,&quot; bringing gifts with them (Matt. 2:1-12).
      Herod&#39;s cruel jealousy led to Joseph&#39;s flight into
      Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried
      till the death of this king (Matt. 2:13-23), when they
      returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee (2:23;
      comp. Luke 4:16; John 1:46, etc.). At the age of twelve
      years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his
      parents. There, in the temple, &quot;in the midst of the
      doctors,&quot; all that heard him were &quot;astonished at
      his understanding and answers&quot; (Luke 2:41, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond
      this, that he returned to Nazareth and &quot;increased in
      wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man&quot;
      (Luke 2:52).
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty
      years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to
      about three years. &quot;Each of these years had peculiar
      features of its own. (1.) The first year may be called the
      year of obscurity, both because the records of it which we
      possess are very scanty, and because he seems during it to
      have been only slowly emerging into public notice. It was
      spent for the most part in Judea. (2.) The second year was
      the year of public favour, during which the country had
      become thoroughly aware of him; his activity was incessant,
      and his frame rang through the length and breadth of the
      land. It was almost wholly passed in Galilee. (3.) The
      third was the year of opposition, when the public favour
      ebbed away. His enemies multiplied and assailed him with
      more and more pertinacity, and at last he fell a victim to
      their hatred. The first six months of this final year were
      passed in Galilee, and the last six in other parts of the
      land.&quot;, Stalker&#39;s Life of Jesus Christ, p. 45.

      The only reliable sources of information regarding the life
      of Christ on earth are the Gospels, which present in

      Israelites were encamped at Sinai, and soon after their
      victory over Amalek, Jethro came to meet Moses, bringing
      with him Zipporah and her two sons. They met at the
      &quot;mount of God,&quot; and &quot;Moses told him all that
      the Lord had done unto Pharaoh&quot; (Ex. 18:8). On the
      following day Jethro, observing the multiplicity of the
      duties devolving on Moses, advised him to appoint
      subordinate judges, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of
      fifties, and of tens, to decide smaller matters, leaving
      only the weightier matters to be referred to Moses, to be
      laid before the Lord. This advice Moses adopted (Ex. 18).

      personal name, while Jethro was an official name. (See <a

      16:6; 25:25; Jer. 32:12; 38:19; 40:11; 41:3), in

    </p>
    <p>
      During the Captivity, and after the Restoration, the name,

      5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally this people were called Hebrews (Gen. 39:14;
      40:15; Ex. 2:7; 3:18; 5:3; 1 Sam. 4:6, 9, etc.), but after
      the Exile this name fell into disuse. But Paul was styled a
      Hebrew (2 Cor. 11:22; Phil. 3:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the
      history of Palestine and with the narratives of the lives
      of their rulers and chief men. They are now [1897]
      dispersed over all lands, and to this day remain a separate
      people, &quot;without a king, and without a prince, and
      without a sacrifice, and without an image [R.V.
      &#39;pillar,&#39; marg. &#39;obelisk&#39;], and without an
      ephod, and without teraphim&quot; (Hos. 3:4). Till about
      the beginning of the present century [1800] they were
      everywhere greatly oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted;
      but now their condition is greatly improved, and they are
      admitted in most European countries to all the rights of
      free citizens. In 1860 the &quot;Jewish disabilities&quot;
      were removed, and they were admitted to a seat in the
      British Parliament. Their number in all is estimated at
      about six millions, about four millions being in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three names used in the New Testament to
      designate this people, (1.) Jews, as regards their
      nationality, to distinguish them from Gentiles. (2.)
      Hebrews, with regard to their language and education, to
      distinguish them from Hellenists, i.e., Jews who spoke the
      Greek language. (3.) Israelites, as respects their sacred
      privileges as the chosen people of God. &quot;To other
      races we owe the splendid inheritance of modern
      civilization and secular culture; but the religious
      education of mankind has been the gift of the Jew
      alone.&quot;

      Herod Agrippa I.</a>

      <a name="T0002064"><b>Jezebel -</b> chaste, the daughter of
      Ethbaal, the king of the Zidonians, and the wife of Ahab,
      the king of Israel (1 Kings 16:31). This was the
      &quot;first time that a king of Israel had allied himself
      by marriage with a heathen princess; and the alliance was
      in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has
      stamped her name on history as the representative of all
      that is designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and
      cruel. She is the first great instigator of persecution
      against the saints of God. Guided by no principle,
      restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in
      her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains
      to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four
      hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to
      Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [R.V.,
      &#39;prophets of the Asherah&#39;], which ate at her table
      (1 Kings 18:19). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased
      and sensual kind.&quot; Her conduct was in many respects
      very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah
      (21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu
      rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the
      window of the palace, and said, &quot;Had Zimri peace, who
      slew his master?&quot; He looked up and called to her
      chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so
      that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses
      trod her under their feet. She was immediately consumed by

      town of Issachar (Josh. 19:18), where the kings of Israel
      often resided (1 Kings 18:45; 21:1; 2 Kings 9:30). Here
      Elijah met Ahab, Jehu, and Bidkar; and here Jehu executed
      his dreadful commission against the house of Ahab (2 Kings
      9:14-37; 10:1-11). It has been identified with the modern
      Zerin, on the most western point of the range of Gilboa,
      reaching down into the great and fertile valley of Jezreel,
      to which it gave its name.</a>

      of which, perhaps that here referred to, &quot;flows from
      under a sort of cavern in the wall of conglomerate rock
      which here forms the base of Gilboa. The water is
      excellent; and issuing from crevices in the rocks, it
      spreads out at once into a fine limpid pool forty or fifty
      feet in diameter, full of fish&quot; (Robinson). This may
      be identical with the &quot;well of Harod&quot; (Judg. 7:1;

      the signal victory gained by the Israelites under Gideon
      over the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the &quot;children
      of the east&quot; (Judg. 6:3). Two centuries after this the
      Israelites were here defeated by the Philistines, and Saul

      This name was in after ages extended to the whole of the

      accessible to the chariots of the Canaanites (comp. 2 Kings

    <p>
      <a name="T0002074"><b>Joab -</b> Jehovah is his father.
      (1.) One of the three sons of Zeruiah, David&#39;s sister,
      and &quot;captain of the host&quot; during the whole of
      David&#39;s reign (2 Sam. 2:13; 10:7; 11:1; 1 Kings 11:15).
      His father&#39;s name is nowhere mentioned, although his
      sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned (2 Sam. 2:32). His two
      brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who
      was killed by Abner (2 Sam. 2:13-32), whom Joab afterwards
      treacherously murdered (3:22-27). He afterwards led the
      assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and
      for this service was raised to the rank of &quot;prince of
      the king&#39;s army&quot; (2 Sam. 5:6-10; 1 Chr. 27:34).
      His chief military achievements were, (1) against the
      allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom (1 Kings
      11:15, 16); and (3) against the Ammonites (2 Sam. 10:7-19;
      11:1, 11). His character is deeply stained by the part he
      willingly took in the murder of Uriah (11:14-25). He acted
      apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death
      (18:1-14). David was unmindful of the many services Joab
      had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the
      army to Amasa, Joab&#39;s cousin (2 Sam. 20:1-13; 19:13).
      When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in
      preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by
      Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his
      father&#39;s injunction (2 Sam. 3:29; 20:5-13), at the
      altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary
      conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his
      favour. He was buried in his own property in the
      &quot;wilderness,&quot; probably in the north-east of
      Jerusalem (1 Kings 2:5, 28-34). Benaiah succeeded him as
      commander-in-chief of the army.</a>

      Amid all his sufferings he maintained his integrity. Once
      more God visited him with the rich tokens of his goodness
      and even greater prosperity than he had enjoyed before. He
      survived the period of trial for one hundred and forty
      years, and died in a good old age, an example to succeeding
      generations of integrity (Ezek. 14:14, 20) and of
      submissive patience under the sorest calamities (James
      5:11). His history, so far as it is known, is recorded in

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002081"><b>Job, Book of -</b> A great diversity
      of opinion exists as to the authorship of this book. From
      internal evidence, such as the similarity of sentiment and
      language to those in the Psalms and Proverbs (see Ps. 88
      and 89), the prevalence of the idea of &quot;wisdom,&quot;
      and the style and character of the composition, it is
      supposed by some to have been written in the time of David
      and Solomon. Others argue that it was written by Job
      himself, or by Elihu, or Isaiah, or perhaps more probably
      by Moses, who was &quot;learned in all the wisdom of the
      Egyptians, and mighty in words and deeds&quot; (Acts 7:22).
      He had opportunities in Midian for obtaining the knowledge
      of the facts related. But the authorship is altogether
      uncertain.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the character of the book, it is a historical poem,
      one of the greatest and sublimest poems in all literature.
      Job was a historical person, and the localities and names
      were real and not fictious. It is &quot;one of the grandest
      portions of the inspired Scriptures, a heavenly-repleished
      storehouse of comfort and instruction, the patriarchal
      Bible, and a precious monument of primitive theology. It is
      to the Old Testament what the Epistle to the Romans is to
      the New.&quot; It is a didactic narrative in a dramatic
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book was apparently well known in the days of Ezekiel,
      B.C. 600 (Ezek. 14:14). It formed a part of the sacred
      Scriptures used by our Lord and his apostles, and is
      referred to as a part of the inspired Word (Heb. 12:5; 1
      Cor. 3:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of the book is the trial of Job, its occasion,
      nature, endurance, and issue. It exhibits the harmony of
      the truths of revelation and the dealings of Providence,
      which are seen to be at once inscrutable, just, and
      merciful. It shows the blessedness of the truly pious, even
      amid sore afflictions, and thus ministers comfort and hope
      to tried believers of every age. It is a book of manifold
      instruction, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
      for correction, and for instruction in righteousness (2
      Tim. 3:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      It consists of,
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) An historical introduction in prose (ch. 1,2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The controversy and its solution, in poetry (ch.
      3-42:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Job&#39;s desponding lamentation (ch. 3) is the occasion of
      the controversy which is carried on in three courses of
      dialogues between Job and his three friends. The first
      course gives the commencement of the controversy (ch.
      4-14); the second the growth of the controversy (15-21);
      and the third the height of the controversy (22-27). This
      is followed by the solution of the controversy in the
      speeches of Elihu and the address of Jehovah, followed by
      Job&#39;s humble confession (42:1-6) of his own fault and
      folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The third division is the historical conclusion, in
      prose (42:7-15).

    <p>
      Sir J. W. Dawson in &quot;The Expositor&quot; says:
      &quot;It would now seem that the language and theology of
      the book of Job can be better explained by supposing it to
      be a portion of Minean [Southern Arabia] literature
      obtained by Moses in Midian than in any other way. This
      view also agrees better than any other with its references
      to natural objects, the art of mining, and other
      matters.&quot;

      the plans of Ishmael against him, a warning which was
      unheeded (Jer. 40:13, 16). He afterwards pursued the
      murderer of the governor, and rescued the captives (41:8,

      (3.) THE APOSTLE, brother of James the &quot;Greater&quot;
      (Matt. 4:21; 10:2; Mark 1:19; 3:17; 10:35). He was one,
      probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee (Matt. 4:21)
      and Salome (Matt. 27:56; comp. Mark 15:40), and was born at
      Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth
      (comp. Mark 1:20; Luke 5:3; John 19:27). He was doubtless
      trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of
      Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of
      a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist
      began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with
      many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced
      by his teaching. There he heard the announcement,
      &quot;Behold the Lamb of God,&quot; and forthwith, on the
      invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his
      followers (John 1:36, 37) for a time. He and his brother
      then returned to their former avocation, for how long is
      uncertain. Jesus again called them (Matt. 4: 21; Luke
      5:1-11), and now they left all and permanently attached
      themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one
      of the innermost circle (Mark 5:37; Matt. 17:1; 26:37; Mark
      13:3). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and
      intensity of character he was a &quot;Boanerges&quot; (Mark
      3:17). This spirit once and again broke out (Matt.
      20:20-24; Mark 10:35-41; Luke 9:49, 54). At the betrayal he
      and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake
      themselves to hasty flight (John 18:15). At the trial he
      follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the
      praetorium (18:16, 19, 28) and to the place of crucifixion
      (19:26, 27). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings
      of the resurrection (20:2), and they are the first to go
      and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection
      he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the
      Lord reveals himself to them (21:1, 7). We find Peter and
      John frequently after this together (Acts 3:1; 4:13). John
      remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the
      church there (Acts 15:6; Gal. 2:9). His subsequent history
      is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of
      Paul&#39;s last visit (Acts 21:15-40). He appears to have
      retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven
      churches of Asia were the objects of his special care (Rev.
      1:11). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to
      Patmos (1:9); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he
      died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly
      all the friends and companions even of his maturer years.
      There are many interesting traditions regarding John during
      his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the
      character of historical truth.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002089"><b>John, First Epistle of -</b> the
      fourth of the catholic or &quot;general&quot; epistles. It
      was evidently written by John the evangelist, and probably
      also at Ephesus, and when the writer was in advanced age.
      The purpose of the apostle (1:1-4) is to declare the Word
      of Life to those to whom he writes, in order that they
      might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son
      Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union with God
      are, (1) on the part of Christ, his atoning work (1:7; 2:2;
      3:5; 4:10, 14; 5:11, 12) and his advocacy (2:1); and (2),
      on the part of man, holiness (1:6), obedience (2:3), purity
      (3:3), faith (3:23; 4:3; 5:5), and love (2:7, 8; 3:14; 4:7;
      5:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002090"><b>John, Gospel of -</b> The genuineness
      of this Gospel, i.e., the fact that the apostle John was
      its author, is beyond all reasonable doubt. In recent
      times, from about 1820, many attempts have been made to
      impugn its genuineness, but without success.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by
      himself (John 20:31). It was at one time supposed that he
      wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the
      synoptical, i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is
      no evidence for this. &quot;There is here no history of
      Jesus and his teaching after the manner of the other
      evangelists. But there is in historical form a
      representation of the Christian faith in relation to the
      person of Christ as its central point; and in this
      representation there is a picture on the one hand of the
      antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and
      on the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who
      yield themselves to him as the Light of life&quot; (Reuss).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the prologue (1:1-5), the historical part of the book
      begins with verse 6, and consists of two parts. The first
      part (1:6-ch. 12) contains the history of our Lord&#39;s
      public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by
      John the Baptist to its close. The second part (ch. 13-21)
      presents our Lord in the retirement of private life and in
      his intercourse with his immediate followers (13-17), and
      gives an account of his sufferings and of his appearances
      to the disciples after his resurrection (18-21).
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiarities of this Gospel are the place it gives (1)
      to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father, and (2)
      of the Redeemer to believers; (3) the announcement of the
      Holy Ghost as the Comforter; (4) the prominence given to
      love as an element in the Christian character. It was
      obviously addressed primarily to Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably written at Ephesus, which, after the
      destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), became the centre of
      Christian life and activity in the East, about A.D. 90.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002091"><b>John, Second Epistle of -</b> is
      addressed to &quot;the elect lady,&quot; and closes with
      the words, &quot;The children of thy elect sister greet
      thee;&quot; but some would read instead of &quot;lady&quot;
      the proper name Kyria. Of the thirteen verses composing
      this epistle seven are in the First Epistle. The person
      addressed is commended for her piety, and is warned against
      false teachers.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002092"><b>John the Baptist -</b> the
      &quot;forerunner of our Lord.&quot; We have but fragmentary
      and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of
      priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of
      the course of Abia (1 Chr. 24:10), and his mother,
      Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron (Luke 1:5). The
      mission of John was the subject of prophecy (Matt. 3:3;
      Isa. 40:3; Mal. 3:1). His birth, which took place six
      months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel.
      Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of
      God&#39;s truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with
      reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech
      restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision (Luke
      1:64). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty
      years than what is mentioned in Luke 1:80. John was a
      Nazarite from his birth (Luke 1:15; Num. 6:1-12). He spent
      his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying
      between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea (Matt. 3:1-12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he came forth into public life, and great
      multitudes from &quot;every quarter&quot; were attracted to
      him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of
      repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a
      &quot;generation of vipers,&quot; and warned them of the
      folly of trusting to external privileges (Luke 3:8).
      &quot;As a preacher, John was eminently practical and
      discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the
      prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore,
      he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The
      publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers
      against crime and plunder.&quot; His doctrine and manner of
      life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people
      from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the
      banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto
      repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth
      (Matt. 3:5), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be
      baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him
      to &quot;fulfil all righteousness&quot; (3:15). John&#39;s
      special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must
      now &quot;increase&quot; as the King come to his kingdom.
      He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the
      Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples,
      saying, &quot;Behold the Lamb of God.&quot; His public
      ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably)
      brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod,
      whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself
      the wife of his brother Philip (Luke 3:19). He was shut up
      in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the
      southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea,
      and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned
      the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all
      that had occurred (Matt. 14:3-12). John&#39;s death
      occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our
      Lord&#39;s ministry. Our Lord himself testified regarding
      him that he was a &quot;burning and a shining light&quot;
      (John 5:35).

    <p>
      <a name="T0002093"><b>John, Third Epistle of -</b> is
      addressed to Caius, or Gaius, but whether to the Christian
      of that name in Macedonia (Acts 19: 29) or in Corinth (Rom.
      16:23) or in Derbe (Acts 20:4) is uncertain. It was written
      for the purpose of commending to Gaius some Christians who
      were strangers in the place where he lived, and who had
      gone thither for the purpose of preaching the gospel (ver.
      7).</a>
