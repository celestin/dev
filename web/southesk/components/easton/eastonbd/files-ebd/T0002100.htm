      <a name="T0002100"><b>Jokneam -</b> gathered by the people,
      (Josh. 19:11; 21:34), a city &quot;of Carmel&quot; (12:22),
      i.e., on Carmel, allotted with its suburbs to the Merarite
      Levites. It is the modern Tell Kaimon, about 12 miles
      south-west of Nazareth, on the south of the river
      Kishon.</a>

      <a name="T0002101"><b>Jokshan -</b> snarer, the second son

      <a name="T0002102"><b>Joktan -</b> little, the second of
      the two sons of Eber (Gen. 10:25; 1 Chr. 1:19). There is an
      Arab tradition that Joktan (Arab. Kahtan) was the
      progenitor of all the purest tribes of Central and Southern
      Arabia.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002103"><b>Joktheel -</b> subdued by God. (1.) A
      city of Judah near Lachish (Josh. 15, 38). Perhaps the ruin
      Kutlaneh, south of Gezer.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Amaziah, king of Judah, undertook a great expedition
      against Edom (2 Chr. 25:5-10), which was completely
      successful. He routed the Edomites and slew vast numbers of
      them. So wonderful did this victory appear to him that he
      acknowledged that it could have been achieved only by the
      special help of God, and therefore he called Selah (q.v.),
      their great fortress city, by the name of Joktheel (2 Kings
      14:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002104"><b>Jonadab -</b> =Jehon&#39;adab. (1.)
      The son of Rechab, and founder of the Rechabites (q.v.), 2
      Kings 10:15; Jer. 35:6, 10.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son of Shimeah, David&#39;s brother (2 Sam. 13:3).
      He was &quot;a very subtil man.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002105"><b>Jonah -</b> a dove, the son of
      Amittai of Gath-hepher. He was a prophet of Israel, and
      predicted the restoration of the ancient boundaries (2
      Kings 14:25-27) of the kingdom. He exercised his ministry
      very early in the reign of Jeroboam II., and thus was
      contemporary with Hosea and Amos; or possibly he preceded
      them, and consequently may have been the very oldest of all
      the prophets whose writings we possess. His personal
      history is mainly to be gathered from the book which bears
      his name. It is chiefly interesting from the two-fold
      character in which he appears, (1) as a missionary to
      heathen Nineveh, and (2) as a type of the &quot;Son of
      man.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002106"><b>Jonah, Book of -</b> This book
      professes to give an account of what actually took place in
      the experience of the prophet. Some critics have sought to
      interpret the book as a parable or allegory, and not as a
      history. They have done so for various reasons. Thus (1)
      some reject it on the ground that the miraculous element
      enters so largely into it, and that it is not prophetical
      but narrative in its form; (2) others, denying the
      possibility of miracles altogether, hold that therefore it
      cannot be true history.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonah and his story is referred to by our Lord (Matt.
      12:39, 40; Luke 11:29), a fact to which the greatest weight
      must be attached. It is impossible to interpret this
      reference on any other theory. This one argument is of
      sufficient importance to settle the whole question. No
      theories devised for the purpose of getting rid of
      difficulties can stand against such a proof that the book
      is a veritable history.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is every reason to believe that this book was written
      by Jonah himself. It gives an account of (1) his divine
      commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and the
      punishment following (1:1-17); (2) his prayer and
      miraculous deliverance (1:17-2:10); (3) the second
      commission given to him, and his prompt obedience in
      delivering the message from God, and its results in the
      repentance of the Ninevites, and God&#39;s long-sparing
      mercy toward them (ch. 3); (4) Jonah&#39;s displeasure at
      God&#39;s merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the
      impatient prophet (ch. 4). Nineveh was spared after
      Jonah&#39;s mission for more than a century. The history of
      Jonah may well be regarded &quot;as a part of that great
      onward movement which was before the Law and under the Law;
      which gained strength and volume as the fulness of the
      times drew near.&quot;, Perowne&#39;s Jonah.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002107"><b>Jonas -</b> (1.) Greek form of Jonah
      (Matt. 12:39, 40, 41, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The father of the apostles Peter (John 21:15-17) and
      Andrew; but the reading should be (also in 1:42), as in the
      Revised Version, &quot;John,&quot; instead of Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002108"><b>Jonathan -</b> whom Jehovah gave, the
      name of fifteen or more persons that are mentioned in
      Scripture. The chief of these are, (1.) A Levite descended
      from Gershom (Judg. 18:30). His history is recorded in
      17:7-13 and 18:30. The Rabbins changed this name into
      Manasseh &quot;to screen the memory of the great lawgiver
      from the stain of having so unworthy an apostate among his
      near descendants.&quot; He became priest of the idol image
      at Dan, and this office continued in his family till the
      Captivity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The eldest son of king Saul, and the bosom friend of
      David. He is first mentioned when he was about thirty years
      of age, some time after his father&#39;s accession to the
      throne (1 Sam. 13:2). Like his father, he was a man of
      great strength and activity (2 Sam. 1:23), and excelled in
      archery and slinging (1 Chr. 12:2;2 Sam. 1:22). The
      affection that evidently subsisted between him and his
      father was interrupted by the growth of Saul&#39;s
      insanity. At length, &quot;in fierce anger,&quot; he left
      his father&#39;s presence and cast in his lot with the
      cause of David (1 Sam. 20:34). After an eventful career,
      interwoven to a great extent with that of David, he fell,
      along with his father and his two brothers, on the fatal
      field of Gilboa (1 Sam. 31:2, 8). He was first buried at
      Jabesh-gilead, but his remains were afterwards removed with
      those of his father to Zelah, in Benjamin (2 Sam.
      21:12-14). His death was the occasion of David&#39;s famous
      elegy of &quot;the Song of the Bow&quot; (2 Sam. 1:17-27).
      He left one son five years old, Merib-baal, or Mephibosheth
      (2 Sam. 4:4; comp. 1 Chr. 8:34).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Son of the high priest Abiathar, and one who adhered
      to David at the time of Absalom&#39;s rebellion (2 Sam.
      15:27, 36). He is the last descendant of Eli of whom there
      is any record.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Son of Shammah, and David&#39;s nephew, and also one
      of his chief warriors (2 Sam. 21:21). He slew a giant in
      Gath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002109"><b>Jonath-elem-rechokim -</b> dove of
      the dumbness of the distance; i.e., &quot;the silent dove
      in distant places&quot;, title of Ps. 56. This was probably
      the name of some well known tune or melody to which the
      psalm was to be sung.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002110"><b>Joppa -</b> beauty, a town in the
      portion of Dan (Josh. 19:46; A.V., &quot;Japho&quot;), on a
      sandy promontory between Caesarea and Gaza, and at a
      distance of 30 miles north-west from Jerusalem. It is one
      of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief
      sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the
      Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second
      century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah &quot;took
      ship to flee from the presence of the Lord&quot; (Jonah
      1:3). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by
      Hiram&#39;s men for Solomon was brought in floats (2 Chr.
      2:16); and here the material for the building of the second
      temple was also landed (Ezra 3:7). At Joppa, in the house
      of Simon the tanner, &quot;by the sea-side,&quot; Peter
      resided &quot;many days,&quot; and here, &quot;on the
      house-top,&quot; he had his &quot;vision of tolerance&quot;
      (Acts 9:36-43). It bears the modern name of Jaffa, and
      exibituds all the decrepitude and squalor of cities ruled
      over by the Turks. &quot;Scarcely any other town has been
      so often overthrown, sacked, pillaged, burned, and
      rebuilt.&quot; Its present population is said to be about
      16,000. It was taken by the French under Napoleon in 1799,
      who gave orders for the massacre here of 4,000 prisoners.
      It is connected with Jerusalem by the only carriage road
      that exists in the country, and also by a railway completed
      in 1892. It is noticed on monuments B.C. 1600-1300, and was
      attacked by Sannacharib B.C. 702.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002111"><b>Joram -</b> =Jeho&#39;ram. (1.) One
      of the kings of Israel (2 Kings 8:16, 25, 28). He was the
      son of Ahab.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Jehoram, the son and successor of Jehoshaphat on the
      throne of Judah (2 Kings 8:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002112"><b>Jordan -</b> Heb. Yarden, &quot;the
      descender;&quot; Arab. Nahr-esh-Sheriah, &quot;the
      watering-place&quot; the chief river of Palestine. It flows
      from north to south down a deep valley in the centre of the
      country. The name descender is significant of the fact that
      there is along its whole course a descent to its banks; or
      it may simply denote the rapidity with which it
      &quot;descends&quot; to the Dead Sea.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It originates in the snows of Hermon, which feed its
      perennial fountains. Two sources are generally spoken of.
      (1.) From the western base of a hill on which once stood
      the city of Dan, the northern border-city of Palestine,
      there gushes forth a considerable fountain called the
      Leddan, which is the largest fountain in Syria and the
      principal source of the Jordan. (2.) Beside the ruins of
      Banias, the ancient Caesarea Philippi and the yet more
      ancient Panium, is a lofty cliff of limestone, at the base
      of which is a fountain. This is the other source of the
      Jordan, and has always been regarded by the Jews as its
      true source. It rushes down to the plain in a foaming
      torrent, and joins the Leddan about 5 miles south of Dan
      (Tell-el-Kady). (3.) But besides these two historical
      fountains there is a third, called the Hasbany, which rises
      in the bottom of a valley at the western base of Hermon, 12
      miles north of Tell-el-Kady. It joins the main stream about
      a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The
      river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and
      flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain.
      After this it flows, &quot;with a swift current and a
      much-twisted course,&quot; through a marshy plain for some
      6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, &quot;the
      waters of Merom&quot; (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      During this part of its course the Jordan has descended
      about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above
      sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake
      Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2
      miles &quot;through a waste of islets and papyrus,&quot;
      and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming
      torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;In the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh
      to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled
      inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and
      the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of
      Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7
      or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages.
      The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous
      enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or
      village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns
      and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with
      peculiar force: &#39;I will make your cities waste, and
      bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring
      the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell
      therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be
      desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy
      her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate&#39; (Lev.
      26:31-34).&quot;, Dr. Porter&#39;s Handbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the
      Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain
      called &quot;the region of Jordan&quot; (Matt. 3:5), and by
      the modern Arabs the Ghor, or &quot;sunken plain.&quot;
      This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down
      through the midst of the &quot;plain of Jordan&quot; there
      winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a
      mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the
      Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to
      the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern
      extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a
      straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of
      the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet.
      The total length of the Jordan from Banias is about 104
      miles in a straight line, during which it falls 2,380 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two considerable affluents which enter the river
      between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, both from the
      east. (1.) The Wady Mandhur, called the Yarmuk by the
      Rabbins and the Hieromax by the Greeks. It formed the
      boundary between Bashan and Gilead. It drains the plateau
      of the Hauran. (2.) The Jabbok or Wady Zerka, formerly the
      northern boundary of Ammon. It enters the Jordan about 20
      miles north of Jericho.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first historical notice of the Jordan is in the account
      of the separation of Abraham and Lot (Gen. 13:10).
      &quot;Lot beheld the plain of Jordan as the garden of the
      Lord.&quot; Jacob crossed and recrossed &quot;this
      Jordan&quot; (32:10). The Israelites passed over it as
      &quot;on dry ground&quot; (Josh. 3:17; Ps. 114:3). Twice
      afterwards its waters were miraculously divided at the same
      spot by Elijah and Elisha (2 Kings 2:8, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jordan is mentioned in the Old Testament about one
      hundred and eighty times, and in the New Testament fifteen
      times. The chief events in gospel history connected with it
      are (1) John the Baptist&#39;s ministry, when &quot;there
      went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and were
      baptized of him in Jordan&quot; (Matt. 3:6). (2.) Jesus
      also &quot;was baptized of John in Jordan&quot; (Mark 1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002113"><b>Joseph -</b> remover or increaser.
      (1.) The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel (Gen.
      30:23, 24), who, on the occasion of his birth, said,
      &quot;God hath taken away [Heb. &#39;asaph] my
      reproach.&quot; &quot;The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to
      me another son&quot; (Gen. 30:24). He was a child of
      probably six years of age when his father returned from
      Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old
      patriarchal town of Hebron. &quot;Now Israel loved Joseph
      more than all his children, because he was the son of his
      old age,&quot; and he &quot;made him a long garment with
      sleeves&quot; (Gen. 37:3, R.V. marg.), i.e., a garment long
      and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This
      seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase,
      however, may also be rendered, &quot;a coat of many
      pieces&quot;, i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of
      divers colours.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the
      jealous hatred of his brothers (Gen. 37:4). They
      &quot;hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto
      him.&quot; Their anger was increased when he told them his
      dreams (37:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to
      Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent
      Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them.
      Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither
      he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began
      to plot against him, and would have killed him had not
      Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of
      Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver
      (about $2, 10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of
      a slave, for &quot;they cared little what they had for him,
      if so be they were rid of him.&quot; These merchants were
      going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the
      Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and
      ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an
      &quot;officer of Pharaoh&#39;s, and captain of the
      guard&quot; (Gen. 37:36). &quot;The Lord blessed the
      Egyptian&#39;s house for Joseph&#39;s sake,&quot; and
      Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a
      false charge having been brought against him by
      Potiphar&#39;s wife, he was at once cast into the state
      prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years.
      After a while the &quot;chief of the cupbearers&quot; and
      the &quot;chief of the bakers&quot; of Pharaoh&#39;s
      household were cast into the same prison (40:2). Each of
      these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night,
      which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to Joseph&#39;s being remembered subsequently by
      the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his
      suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the
      king&#39;s dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with
      Joseph&#39;s wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with
      his counsel with reference to the events then predicted;
      and he set him over all the land of Egypt (Gen. 41:46), and
      gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to
      Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became
      a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came,
      during which he stored up great abundance of corn in
      granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed
      by seven years of famine &quot;over all the face of the
      earth,&quot; when &quot;all countries came into Egypt to
      Joseph to buy corn&quot; (Gen. 41:56, 57; 47:13, 14). Thus
      &quot;Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land
      of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which
      they bought.&quot; Afterwards all the cattle and all the
      land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the
      property of Pharaoh.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period of famine Joseph&#39;s brethren also
      came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings
      with them, and of the manner in which he at length made
      himself known to them, is one of the most interesting
      narratives that can be read (Gen. 42-45). Joseph directed
      his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to
      the land of Egypt, saying, &quot;I will give you the good
      of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
      Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is
      yours.&quot; Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the
      number of threescore and ten souls, together with &quot;all
      that they had,&quot; went down to Egypt. They were settled
      in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and
      &quot;fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good
      while&quot; (Gen. 46:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of
      Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and
      Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for
      their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and
      were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription
      speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering
      shepherds of Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which
      he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father
      in &quot;the field of Ephron the Hittite&quot; (Gen.
      47:29-31; 50:1-14). This was the last recorded act of
      Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The &#39;Story of the Two Brothers,&#39; an Egyptian
      romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the
      Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the
      Biblical account of Joseph&#39;s treatment by
      Potiphar&#39;s wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the
      Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, &#39;the gift of the sun-god.&#39;
      The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the
      Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, &#39;nourisher of the living
      one,&#39; i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in
      the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian
      names, and rising to the highest offices of state.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and
      Ephraim (Gen. 41:50). Joseph having obtained a promise from
      his brethren that when the time should come that God would
      &quot;bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham,
      to Isaac, and to Jacob,&quot; they would carry up his bones
      out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and
      ten years; and &quot;they embalmed him, and he was put in a
      coffin&quot; (Gen. 50:26). This promise was faithfully
      observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus
      came, carried the body about with them during their forty
      years&#39; wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem,
      in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of
      Hamor (Josh. 24:32; comp. Gen. 33:19). With the death of
      Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to
      a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pharaoh of Joseph&#39;s elevation was probably Apepi,
      or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however,
      think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes
      III. (see PHARAOH &macr;T0002923), long after the expulsion
      of the Hyksos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and
      Manasseh in Deut. 33:13-17; the kingdom of Israel in Ezek.
      37:16, 19, Amos 5:6; and the whole covenant people of
      Israel in Ps. 81:4.

      (2.) One of the sons of Asaph, head of the first division
      of sacred musicians (1 Chr. 25:2, 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The son of Judah, and father of Semei (Luke 3:26).
      Other two of the same name in the ancestry of Christ are
      also mentioned (3:24, 30).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The foster-father of our Lord (Matt. 1:16; Luke 3:23).
      He lived at Nazareth in Galilee (Luke 2:4). He is called a
      &quot;just man.&quot; He was by trade a carpenter (Matt.
      13:55). He is last mentioned in connection with the journey
      to Jerusalem, when Jesus was twelve years old. It is
      probable that he died before Jesus entered on his public
      ministry. This is concluded from the fact that Mary only
      was present at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. His
      name does not appear in connection with the scenes of the
      crucifixion along with that of Mary (q.v.), John 19:25.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) A native of Arimathea, probably the Ramah of the Old
      Testament (1 Sam. 1:19), a man of wealth, and a member of
      the Sanhedrim (Matt. 27:57; Luke 23:50), an
      &quot;honourable counsellor, who waited for the kingdom of
      God.&quot; As soon as he heard the tidings of Christ&#39;s
      death, he &quot;went in boldly&quot; (lit. &quot;having
      summoned courage, he went&quot;) &quot;unto Pilate, and
      craved the body of Jesus.&quot; Pilate having ascertained
      from the centurion that the death had really taken place,
      granted Joseph&#39;s request, who immediately, having
      purchased fine linen (Mark 15:46), proceeded to Golgotha to
      take the body down from the cross. There, assisted by
      Nicodemus, he took down the body and wrapped it in the fine
      linen, sprinkling it with the myrrh and aloes which
      Nicodemus had brought (John 19:39), and then conveyed the
      body to the new tomb hewn by Joseph himself out of a rock
      in his garden hard by. There they laid it, in the presence
      of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses, and other
      women, and rolled a great stone to the entrance, and
      departed (Luke 23:53, 55). This was done in haste,
      &quot;for the Sabbath was drawing on&quot; (comp. Isa.
      53:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) Surnamed Barsabas (Acts 1:23); also called Justus. He
      was one of those who &quot;companied with the apostles all
      the time that the Lord Jesus went out and in among
      them&quot; (Acts 1:21), and was one of the candidates for
      the place of Judas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002114"><b>Joshua -</b> Jehovah is his help, or
      Jehovah the Saviour. The son of Nun, of the tribe of
      Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He
      is called Jehoshua in Num. 13:16 (A.V.), and Jesus in Acts
      7:45 and Heb. 4:8 (R.V., Joshua).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb,
      with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the
      events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of
      the host of the Israelites at their great battle against
      the Amalekites in Rephidim (Ex. 17:8-16). He became
      Moses&#39; minister or servant, and accompanied him part of
      the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two
      tables (Ex. 32:17). He was also one of the twelve who were
      sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (Num. 13:16,
      17), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report.
      Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death,
      invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with
      authority over the people as his successor (Deut. 31:23).
      The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the
      command (Josh. 1:1); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped
      at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept
      the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the
      Lord&#39;s host, who spoke to him encouraging words
      (1:1-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for
      many years, the record of which is in the book which bears
      his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered
      by him (Josh. 11:18-23; 12:24). Having thus subdued the
      Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes,
      Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as
      his own inheritance. (See SHILOH &macr;T0003375; <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003000.html&amp;from=T0003001&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      PRIEST</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and
      ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the
      Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah
      (Josh. 24); and &quot;the light of Israel for the time
      faded away.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ (Heb. 4:8) in
      the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both;
      (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the
      Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly
      Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel
      succeeds the Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by
      Edersheim:, &quot;Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been
      about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached
      to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive
      battle against Amalek (Ex. 17:9, 13), while Moses in the
      prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given
      &#39;rod.&#39; It was no doubt on that occasion that his
      name was changed from Oshea, &#39;help,&#39; to Jehoshua,
      &#39;Jehovah is help&#39; (Num. 13:16). And this name is
      the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people
      into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the
      land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of
      Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was
      the embodiment of his new name, &#39;Jehovah is help.&#39;
      To this outward calling his character also corresponded. It
      is marked by singleness of purpose, directness, and
      decision...He sets an object before him, and unswervingly
      follows it&quot; (Bible Hist., iii. 103)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002115"><b>Joshua, The Book of -</b> contains a
      history of the Israelites from the death of Moses to that
      of Joshua. It consists of three parts: (1.) The history of
      the conquest of the land (1-12). (2.) The allotment of the
      land to the different tribes, with the appointment of
      cities of refuge, the provision for the Levites (13-22),
      and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes.
      This section has been compared to the Domesday Book of the
      Norman conquest. (3.) The farewell addresses of Joshua,
      with an account of his death (23, 24).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This book stands first in the second of the three sections,
      (1) the Law, (2) the Prophets, (3) the &quot;other
      writings&quot; = Hagiographa, into which the Jewish Church
      divided the Old Testament. There is every reason for
      concluding that the uniform tradition of the Jews is
      correct when they assign the authorship of the book to
      Joshua, all except the concluding section; the last verses
      (24:29-33) were added by some other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two difficulties connected with this book which
      have given rise to much discussion, (1.) The miracle of the
      standing still of the sun and moon on Gibeon. The record of
      it occurs in Joshua&#39;s impassioned prayer of faith, as
      quoted (Josh. 10:12-15) from the &quot;Book of Jasher&quot;
      (q.v.). There are many explanations given of these words.
      They need, however, present no difficulty if we believe in
      the possibility of God&#39;s miraculous interposition in
      behalf of his people. Whether it was caused by the
      refraction of the light, or how, we know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another difficulty arises out of the command given by
      God utterly to exterminate the Canaanites. &quot;Shall not
      the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot; It is enough
      that Joshua clearly knew that this was the will of God, who
      employs his terrible agencies, famine, pestilence, and war,
      in the righteous government of this world. The Canaanites
      had sunk into a state of immorality and corruption so foul
      and degrading that they had to be rooted out of the land
      with the edge of the sword. &quot;The Israelites&#39;
      sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a work of mercy
      for all the countries of the earth to the very end of the
      world.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number
      and variety of historical incidents it records, and in its
      many references to persons and places; and as in the latter
      case the epistles of Paul (see Paley&#39;s Horae Paul.)
      confirm its historical accuracy by their incidental
      allusions and &quot;undesigned coincidences,&quot; so in
      the former modern discoveries confirm its historicity. The
      Amarna tablets (see ADONIZEDEC &macr;T0000099) are among
      the most remarkable discoveries of the age. Dating from
      about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua, and consisting
      of official communications from Amorite, Phoenician, and
      Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, they afford a
      glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior to the
      Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history of
      the conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a military
      officer, &quot;master of the captains of Egypt,&quot;
      dating from near the end of the reign of Rameses II., gives
      a curious account of a journey, probably official, which he
      undertook through Palestine as far north as to Aleppo, and
      an insight into the social condition of the country at that
      time. Among the things brought to light by this letter and
      the Amarna tablets is the state of confusion and decay that
      had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptian garrisons that had
      held possession of Palestine from the time of Thothmes
      III., some two hundred years before, had now been
      withdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In the
      history of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua
      having encountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain
      many appeals to the king of Egypt for help against the
      inroads of the Hebrews, but no help seems ever to have been
      sent. Is not this just such a state of things as might have
      been anticipated as the result of the disaster of the
      Exodus? In many points, as shown under various articles,
      the progress of the conquest is remarkably illustrated by
      the tablets. The value of modern discoveries in their
      relation to Old Testament history has been thus well
      described:
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of
      historical credibility, as against the testimony of the Old
      Testament, has of late years greatly increased. The outcome
      of recent excavations and explorations is altogether
      against it. As long as these books contained, in the main,
      the only known accounts of the events they mention, there
      was some plausibility in the theory that perhaps these
      accounts were written rather to teach moral lessons than to
      preserve an exact knowledge of events. It was easy to say
      in those times men had not the historic sense. But the
      recent discoveries touch the events recorded in the Bible
      at very many different points in many different
      generations, mentioning the same persons, countries,
      peoples, events that are mentioned in the Bible, and
      showing beyond question that these were strictly historic.
      The point is not that the discoveries confirm the
      correctness of the Biblical statements, though that is
      commonly the case, but that the discoveries show that the
      peoples of those ages had the historic sense, and,
      specifically, that the Biblical narratives they touch are
      narratives of actual occurrences.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002116"><b>Josiah -</b> healed by Jehovah, or
      Jehovah will support. The son of Amon, and his successor on
      the throne of Judah (2 Kings 22:1; 2 Chr. 34:1). His
      history is contained in 2 Kings 22, 23. He stands foremost
      among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving
      loyalty to Jehovah (23:25). He &quot;did that which was
      right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way
      of David his father.&quot; He ascended the throne at the
      early age of eight years, and it appears that not till
      eight years afterwards did he begin &quot;to seek after the
      God of David his father.&quot; At that age he devoted
      himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war
      of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had
      practically been the state religion for some seventy years
      (2 Chr. 34:3; comp. Jer. 25:3, 11, 29).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair
      and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had
      become sorely dilapidated (2 Kings 22:3, 5, 6; 23:23; 2
      Chr. 34:11). While this work was being carried on, Hilkiah,
      the high priest, discovered a roll, which was probably the
      original copy of the law, the entire Pentateuch, written by
      Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this book was read to him, the king was alarmed by the
      things it contained, and sent for Huldah, the
      &quot;prophetess,&quot; for her counsel. She spoke to him
      words of encouragement, telling him that he would be
      gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days
      of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people
      together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient
      national covenant with God. The Passover was then
      celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor,
      Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless,
      &quot;the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great
      wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah&quot;
      (2 Kings 22:3-20; 23:21-27; 2 Chr. 35:1-19). During the
      progress of this great religious revolution Jeremiah helped
      it on by his earnest exhortations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, Pharaoh-Necho II. (q.v.), king of Egypt,
      in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view
      of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage
      through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah
      refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new
      alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word
      he sought to oppose the progress of Necho.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at
      Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon. Josiah
      went into the field in disguise, and was fatally wounded by
      a random arrow. His attendants conveyed him toward
      Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles
      south of Megiddo, when he died (2 Kings 23:28, 30; comp. 2
      Chr. 35:20-27), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was
      buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of
      Huldah&#39;s prophecy (2 Kings 22:20; comp. Jer. 34:5).
      Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the
      kings of Israel (Lam. 4:20; 2 Chr. 35:25). The outburst of
      national grief on account of his death became proverbial
      (Zech. 12:11; comp. Rev. 16:16).

      house of Millo&quot; were gathered together &quot;by the
      plain of the pillar&quot; (i.e., the stone set up by
      Joshua, 24:26; comp. Gen. 35:4) &quot;that was in Shechem,
      to make Abimelech king,&quot; from one of the heights of
      Mount Gerizim he protested against their doing so in the
      earliest parable, that of the bramble-king. His words then
      spoken were prophetic. There came a recoil in the feelings
      of the people toward Abimelech, and then a terrible
      revenge, in which many were slain and the city of Shechem
      was destroyed by Abimelech (Judg. 9:45). Having delivered
      his warning, Jotham fled to Beer from the vengeance of
      Abimelech (9:7-21).</a>

      twenty-five years of age, administered for seven years the
      affairs of the kingdom in his father&#39;s stead (2 Chr.
      26:21, 23; 27:1). After his father&#39;s death he became
      sole monarch, and reigned for sixteen years (B.C. 759-743).
      He ruled in the fear of God, and his reign was prosperous.
      He was contemporary with the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, and
      Micah, by whose ministrations he profited. He was buried in
      the sepulchre of the kings, greatly lamented by the people
      (2 Kings 15:38; 2 Chr. 27:7-9).

      year the land was to be fallow, and the Israelites were
      only permitted to gather the spontaneous produce of the
      fields (Lev. 25:11, 12). All landed property during that
      year reverted to its original owner (13-34; 27:16-24), and
      all who were slaves were set free (25:39-54), and all debts

      The return of the jubilee year was proclaimed by a blast of
      trumpets which sounded throughout the land. There is no

      festival, but there are numerous allusions (Isa. 5:7, 8, 9,
      10; 61:1, 2; Ezek. 7:12, 13; Neh. 5:1-19; 2 Chr. 36:21)

      few to the detriment of the community at large. 2. It would
      render it impossible for any one to be born to absolute
      poverty, since every one had his hereditary land. 3. It
      would preclude those inequalities which are produced by
      extremes of riches and poverty, and which make one man
      domineer over another. 4. It would utterly do away with
      slavery. 5. It would afford a fresh opportunity to those
      who were reduced by adverse circumstances to begin again
      their career of industry in the patrimony which they had
      temporarily forfeited. 6. It would periodically rectify the
      disorders which crept into the state in the course of time,
      preclude the division of the people into nobles and

      the tribe of Benjamin joined the tribe of Judah, and
      Jerusalem became the capital of the new kingdom (Josh.
      18:28), which was called the kingdom of Judah. It was very
      small in extent, being only about the size of the Scottish
      county of Perth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first sixty years the kings of Judah aimed at
      re-establishing their authority over the kingdom of the
      other ten tribes, so that there was a state of perpetual
      war between them. For the next eighty years there was no
      open war between them. For the most part they were in
      friendly alliance, co-operating against their common
      enemies, especially against Damascus. For about another
      century and a half Judah had a somewhat checkered existence
      after the termination of the kingdom of Israel till its
      final overthrow in the destruction of the temple (B.C. 588)
      by Nebuzar-adan, who was captain of Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s

      <a name="T0002127"><b>Judah, Tribe of -</b> Judah and his
      three surviving sons went down with Jacob into Egypt (Gen.
      46:12; Ex. 1:2). At the time of the Exodus, when we meet
      with the family of Judah again, they have increased to the
      number of 74,000 males (Num. 1:26, 27). Its number
      increased in the wilderness (26:22). Caleb, the son of
      Jephunneh, represented the tribe as one of the spies (13:6;
      34:19). This tribe marched at the van on the east of the
      tabernacle (Num. 2:3-9; 10:14), its standard, as is
      supposed, being a lion&#39;s whelp. Under Caleb, during the
      wars of conquest, they conquered that portion of the
      country which was afterwards assigned to them as their
      inheritance. This was the only case in which any tribe had
      its inheritance thus determined (Josh. 14:6-15;
      15:13-19).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The inheritance of the tribe of Judah was at first fully
      one-third of the whole country west of Jordan, in all about
      2,300 square miles (Josh. 15). But there was a second
      distribution, when Simeon received an allotment, about
      1,000 square miles, out of the portion of Judah (Josh.
      19:9). That which remained to Judah was still very large in
      proportion to the inheritance of the other tribes. The
      boundaries of the territory are described in Josh.
      15:20-63.
    </p>
    <p>
      This territory given to Judah was divided into four
      sections. (1.) The south (Heb. negeb), the undulating
      pasture-ground between the hills and the desert to the
      south (Josh. 15:21.) This extent of pasture-land became
      famous as the favourite camping-ground of the old
      patriarchs. (2.) The &quot;valley&quot; (15:33) or lowland
      (Heb. shephelah), a broad strip lying between the central
      highlands and the Mediterranean. This tract was the garden
      as well as the granary of the tribe. (3.) The
      &quot;hill-country,&quot; or the mountains of Judah, an
      elevated plateau stretching from below Hebron northward to
      Jerusalem. &quot;The towns and villages were generally
      perched on the tops of hills or on rocky slopes. The
      resources of the soil were great. The country was rich in
      corn, wine, oil, and fruit; and the daring shepherds were
      able to lead their flocks far out over the neighbouring
      plains and through the mountains.&quot; The number of towns
      in this district was thirty-eight (Josh. 15:48-60). (4.)
      The &quot;wilderness,&quot; the sunken district next the
      Dead Sea (Josh. 15:61), &quot;averaging 10 miles in
      breadth, a wild, barren, uninhabitable region, fit only to
      afford scanty pasturage for sheep and goats, and a secure
      home for leopards, bears, wild goats, and outlaws&quot; (1
      Sam. 17:34; 22:1; Mark 1:13). It was divided into the
      &quot;wilderness of En-gedi&quot; (1 Sam. 24:1), the
      &quot;wilderness of Judah&quot; (Judg. 1:16; Matt. 3:1),
      between the Hebron mountain range and the Dead Sea, the
      &quot;wilderness of Maon&quot; (1 Sam. 23:24). It contained
      only six cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine of the cities of Judah were assigned to the priests
      (Josh. 21:9-19).

      following the Masoretic punctuation, the expression should
      read thus, &quot;and Judah; the Jordan was toward the
      sun-rising.&quot; The sixty cities (Havoth-jair, Num.
      32:41) on the east of Jordan were reckoned as belonging to
      Judah, because Jair, their founder, was a Manassite only on
      his mother&#39;s side, but on his father&#39;s side of the
      tribe of Judah (1 Chr. 2:5, 21-23).</a>

      (2.) Son of Simon (John 6:71; 13:2, 26), surnamed Iscariot,
      i.e., a man of Kerioth (Josh. 15:25). His name is uniformly
      the last in the list of the apostles, as given in the
      synoptic (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The evil of his
      nature probably gradually unfolded itself till &quot;Satan
      entered into him&quot; (John 13:27), and he betrayed our
      Lord (18:3). Afterwards he owned his sin with &quot;an
      exceeding bitter cry,&quot; and cast the money he had
      received as the wages of his iniquity down on the floor of
      the sanctuary, and &quot;departed and went and hanged
      himself&quot; (Matt. 27:5). He perished in his guilt, and
      &quot;went unto his own place&quot; (Acts 1:25). The
      statement in Acts 1:18 that he &quot;fell headlong and
      burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed
      out,&quot; is in no way contrary to that in Matt. 27:5. The
      sucide first hanged himself, perhaps over the valley of
      Hinnom, &quot;and the rope giving way, or the branch to
      which he hung breaking, he fell down headlong on his face,
      and was crushed and mangled on the rocky pavement
      below.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why such a man was chosen to be an apostle we know not, but
      it is written that &quot;Jesus knew from the beginning who
      should betray him&quot; (John 6:64). Nor can any answer be
      satisfactorily given to the question as to the motives that
      led Judas to betray his Master. &quot;Of the motives that
      have been assigned we need not care to fix on any one as
      that which simply led him on. Crime is, for the most part,
      the result of a hundred motives rushing with bewildering
      fury through the mind of the criminal.&quot;

      (3.) A Jew of Damascus (Acts 9:11), to whose house Ananias
      was sent. The street called &quot;Straight&quot; in which
      it was situated is identified with the modern &quot;street
      of bazaars,&quot; where is still pointed out the so-called
      &quot;house of Judas.&quot;

    <p>
      (4.) A Christian teacher, surnamed Barsabas. He was sent
      from Jerusalem to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas with
      the decision of the council (Acts 15:22, 27, 32). He was a

      <a name="T0002130"><b>Jude -</b> = Judas. Among the
      apostles there were two who bore this name, (1) Judas (Jude
      1:1; Matt. 13:55; John 14:22; Acts 1:13), called also
      Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus (Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18); and (2)
      Judas Iscariot (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:19). He who is called
      &quot;the brother of James&quot; (Luke 6:16), may be the
      same with the Judas surnamed Lebbaeus. The only thing
      recorded regarding him is in John 14:22.</a>

      <a name="T0002131"><b>Judea -</b> After the Captivity this
      name was applied to the whole of the country west of the
      Jordan (Hag. 1:1, 14; 2:2). But under the Romans, in the
      time of Christ, it denoted the southernmost of the three
      divisions of Palestine (Matt. 2:1, 5; 3:1; 4:25), although
      it was also sometimes used for Palestine generally (Acts
      28:21).</a>

      The province of Judea, as distinguished from Galilee and
      Samaria, included the territories of the tribes of Judah,
      Benjamin, Dan, Simeon, and part of Ephraim. Under the

      governed by a procurator.

      <a name="T0002132"><b>Jude, Epistle of -</b> The author was
      &quot;Judas, the brother of James&quot; the Less (Jude
      1:1), called also Lebbaeus (Matt. 10:3) and Thaddaeus (Mark
      3:18). The genuineness of this epistle was early
      questioned, and doubts regarding it were revived at the
      time of the Reformation; but the evidences in support of
      its claims are complete. It has all the marks of having
      proceeded from the writer whose name it bears.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing very definite to determine the time and
      place at which it was written. It was apparently written in
      the later period of the apostolic age, for when it was
      written there were persons still alive who had heard the
      apostles preach (ver. 17). It may thus have been written
      about A.D. 66 or 70, and apparently in Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epistle is addressed to Christians in general (ver. 1),
      and its design is to put them on their guard against the
      misleading efforts of a certain class of errorists to which
      they were exposed. The style of the epistle is that of an
      &quot;impassioned invective, in the impetuous whirlwind of
      which the writer is hurried along, collecting example after
      example of divine vengeance on the ungodly; heaping epithet
      upon epithet, and piling image upon image, and, as it were,
      labouring for words and images strong enough to depict the
      polluted character of the licentious apostates against whom
      he is warning the Church; returning again and again to the
      subject, as though all language was insufficient to give an
      adequate idea of their profligacy, and to express his
      burning hatred of their perversion of the doctrines of the
      gospel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The striking resemblance this epistle bears to 2 Peter
      suggests the idea that the author of the one had seen the
      epistle of the other.

    <p>
      The doxology with which the epistle concludes is regarded
      as the finest in the New Testament.

      <a name="T0002133"><b>Judge -</b> (Heb. shophet, pl.
      shophetim), properly a magistrate or ruler, rather than one
      who judges in the sense of trying a cause. This is the name
      given to those rulers who presided over the affairs of the
      Israelites during the interval between the death of Joshua
      and the accession of Saul (Judg. 2:18), a period of general
      anarchy and confusion. &quot;The office of judges or
      regents was held during life, but it was not hereditary,
      neither could they appoint their successors. Their
      authority was limited by the law alone, and in doubtful
      cases they were directed to consult the divine King through
      the priest by Urim and Thummim (Num. 27:21). Their
      authority extended only over those tribes by whom they had
      been elected or acknowledged. There was no income attached
      to their office, and they bore no external marks of
      dignity. The only cases of direct divine appointment are
      those of Gideon and Samson, and the latter stood in the
      peculiar position of having been from before his birth
      ordained &#39;to begin to deliver Israel.&#39; Deborah was
      called to deliver Israel, but was already a judge. Samuel
      was called by the Lord to be a prophet but not a judge,
      which ensued from the high gifts the people recognized as
      dwelling in him; and as to Eli, the office of judge seems
      to have devolved naturally or rather ex officio upon
      him.&quot; Of five of the judges, Tola (Judg. 10:1), Jair
      (3), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8-15), we have no record at

      history is not the history of individuals but of the
      kingdom of God in its onward progress.</a>

      of this book, but about A.D. 450 it was separated from it
      and placed in the Hebrew scriptures immediately after the
      Song of Solomon.</a>

    <p>
      The book contains, (1.) An introduction (1-3:6), connecting
      it with the previous narrative in Joshua, as a &quot;link
      in the chain of books.&quot; (2.) The history of the
      thirteen judges (3:7-16:31) in the following order:
    </p>
    <p>
      | FIRST PERIOD (3:7-ch. 5) | Years | I. Servitude under

      Philistines 40 | 13. SAMSON 20 | (60) | In all 410
    </p>
    <p>
      Samson&#39;s exploits probably synchronize with the period
      immediately preceding the national repentance and
      reformation under Samuel (1 Sam. 7:2-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      After Samson came Eli, who was both high priest and judge.
      He directed the civil and religious affairs of the people
      for forty years, at the close of which the Philistines
      again invaded the land and oppressed it for twenty years.
      Samuel was raised up to deliver the people from this
      oppression, and he judged Israel for some twelve years,
      when the direction of affairs fell into the hands of Saul,
      who was anointed king. If Eli and Samuel are included,
      there were then fifteen judges. But the chronology of this
      whole period is uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The historic section of the book is followed by an
      appendix (17-21), which has no formal connection with that
      which goes before. It records (a) the conquest (17, 18) of
      Laish by a portion of the tribe of Dan; and (b) the almost
      total extinction of the tribe of Benjamin by the other
      tribes, in consequence of their assisting the men of Gibeah
      (19-21). This section properly belongs to the period only a
      few years after the death of Joshua. It shows the religious
      and moral degeneracy of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of this book was most probably Samuel. The
      internal evidence both of the first sixteen chapters and of
      the appendix warrants this conclusion. It was probably
      composed during Saul&#39;s reign, or at the very beginning
      of David&#39;s. The words in 18:30,31, imply that it was
      written after the taking of the ark by the Philistines, and
      after it was set up at Nob (1 Sam. 21). In David&#39;s
      reign the ark was at Gibeon (1 Chr. 16:39)

      renders &quot;palace.&quot; In Mark 15:16 the word is
      rendered &quot;Praetorium&quot; (q.v.), which is a Latin
      word, meaning literally the residence of the praetor, and
      then the governor&#39;s residence in general, though not a
      praetor. Throughout the Gospels the word
      &quot;praitorion&quot; has this meaning (comp. Acts 23:35).
      Pilate&#39;s official residence when he was in Jerusalem
      was probably a part of the fortress of Antonia.</a>

    <p>
      The trial of our Lord was carried on in a room or office of

    <p>
      The judge is Jesus Christ, as mediator. All judgment is
      committed to him (Acts 17:31; John 5:22, 27; Rev. 1:7).
      &quot;It pertains to him as mediator to complete and
      publicly manifest the salvation of his people and the
      overthrow of his enemies, together with the glorious
      righteousness of his work in both respects.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons to be judged are, (1) the whole race of Adam
      without a single exception (Matt. 25:31-46; 1 Cor. 15:51,
      52; Rev. 20:11-15); and (2) the fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4;
      Jude 1:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule of judgment is the standard of God&#39;s law as
      revealed to men, the heathen by the law as written on their
      hearts (Luke 12:47,48; Rom. 2:12-16); the Jew who
      &quot;sinned in the law shall be judged by the law&quot;
      (Rom. 2:12); the Christian enjoying the light of
      revelation, by the will of God as made known to him (Matt.
      11:20-24; John 3:19). Then the secrets of all hearts will
      be brought to light (1 Cor. 4:5; Luke 8:17; 12:2,3) to
      vindicate the justice of the sentence pronounced.

      welfare of our immortal interests, flee to the refuge set
      before us, improve our precious time, depend on the merits

      under the genus genista. It is a desert shrub, and abounds
      in many parts of Palestine. In the account of his journey
      from Akabah to Jerusalem, Dr. Robinson says: &quot;This is
      the largest and most conspicuous shrub of these deserts,
      growing thickly in the water-courses and valleys. Our Arabs
      always selected the place of encampment, if possible, in a
      spot where it grew, in order to be sheltered by it at night
      from the wind; and during the day, when they often went on
      in advance of the camels, we found them not unfrequently
      sitting or sleeping under a bush of retem to shelter them
      from the sun. It was in this very desert, a day&#39;s
      journey from Beersheba, that the prophet Elijah lay down
      and slept beneath the same shrub&quot; (1 Kings 19:4, 5).
      It afforded material for fuel, and also in cases of
      extremity for human food (Ps. 120:4; Job 30:4). One of the

      under various epithets. Barnabas was identified with this
      god by the Lycaonians (Acts 14:12), because he was of
      stately and commanding presence, as they supposed Jupiter
      to be. There was a temple dedicated to this god outside the

      <a name="T0002145"><b>Justice -</b> is rendering to every
      one that which is his due. It has been distinguished from
      equity in this respect, that while justice means merely the
      doing what positive law demands, equity means the doing of
      what is fair and right in every separate case.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002146"><b>Justice of God -</b> that perfection
      of his nature whereby he is infinitely righteous in himself
      and in all he does, the righteousness of the divine nature
      exercised in his moral government. At first God imposes
      righteous laws on his creatures and executes them
      righteously. Justice is not an optional product of his
      will, but an unchangeable principle of his very nature. His
      legislative justice is his requiring of his rational
      creatures conformity in all respects to the moral law. His
      rectoral or distributive justice is his dealing with his
      accountable creatures according to the requirements of the
      law in rewarding or punishing them (Ps. 89:14). In
      remunerative justice he distributes rewards (James 1:12; 2
      Tim. 4:8); in vindictive or punitive justice he inflicts
      punishment on account of transgression (2 Thess. 1:6). He
      cannot, as being infinitely righteous, do otherwise than
      regard and hate sin as intrinsically hateful and deserving
      of punishment. &quot;He cannot deny himself&quot; (2 Tim.
      2:13). His essential and eternal righteousness immutably
      determines him to visit every sin as such with merited
      punishment.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002147"><b>Justification -</b> a forensic term,
      opposed to condemnation. As regards its nature, it is the
      judicial act of God, by which he pardons all the sins of
      those who believe in Christ, and accounts, accepts, and
      treats them as righteous in the eye of the law, i.e., as
      conformed to all its demands. In addition to the pardon
      (q.v.) of sin, justification declares that all the claims
      of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified. It is
      the act of a judge and not of a sovereign. The law is not
      relaxed or set aside, but is declared to be fulfilled in
      the strictest sense; and so the person justified is
      declared to be entitled to all the advantages and rewards
      arising from perfect obedience to the law (Rom.
      5:1-10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It proceeds on the imputing or crediting to the believer by
      God himself of the perfect righteousness, active and
      passive, of his Representative and Surety, Jesus Christ
      (Rom. 10:3-9). Justification is not the forgiveness of a
      man without righteousness, but a declaration that he
      possesses a righteousness which perfectly and for ever
      satisfies the law, namely, Christ&#39;s righteousness (2
      Cor. 5:21; Rom. 4:6-8).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sole condition on which this righteousness is imputed
      or credited to the believer is faith in or on the Lord
      Jesus Christ. Faith is called a &quot;condition,&quot; not
      because it possesses any merit, but only because it is the
      instrument, the only instrument by which the soul
      appropriates or apprehends Christ and his righteousness
      (Rom. 1:17; 3:25, 26; 4:20, 22; Phil. 3:8-11; Gal. 2:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      The act of faith which thus secures our justification
      secures also at the same time our sanctification (q.v.);
      and thus the doctrine of justification by faith does not
      lead to licentiousness (Rom. 6:2-7). Good works, while not
      the ground, are the certain consequence of justification
      (6:14; 7:6). (See GALATIANS, EPISTLE <a href=

      Ezek. 27:21), who dwelt in the north-west of Arabia. They
      lived in black hair-tents (Cant. 1:5). To &quot;dwell in
      the tents of Kedar&quot; was to be cut off from the worship
      of the true God (Ps. 120:5). The Kedarites suffered at the

      (3.) A &quot;fenced city&quot; of Naphtali, one of the

      to the Gershonite Levites (Josh. 21:32). It was originally
      a Canaanite royal city (Josh. 12:22), and was the residence
      of Barak (Judg. 4:6); and here he and Deborah assembled the
      tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali before the commencement of
      the conflict with Sisera in the plain of Esdraelon,
      &quot;for Jehovah among the mighty&quot; (9, 10). In the
      reign of Pekah it was taken by Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings
      15:29). It was situated near the &quot;plain&quot; (rather
      &quot;the oak&quot;) of Zaanaim, and has been identified
      with the modern Kedes, on the hills fully four miles
      north-west of Lake El Huleh.

      It has been supposed by some that the Kedesh of the

      inhabitants proving unfaithful to him, in that they sought
      to deliver him up to Saul (13), he and his men
      &quot;departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they
      could go.&quot; They fled to the hill Hareth, about 3 miles
      to the east, and thence through Hebron to Ziph (q.v.).
      &quot;And David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a

      &quot;and strengthened his hand in God.&quot; This was the
      last interview between David and Jonathan (23:16-18). It is
      the modern Khurbet Kila. Others identify it with

      <a name="T0002173"><b>Kenites -</b> smiths, the name of a
      tribe inhabiting the desert lying between southern
      Palestine and the mountains of Sinai. Jethro was of this
      tribe (Judg. 1:16). He is called a &quot;Midianite&quot;
      (Num. 10:29), and hence it is concluded that the Midianites
      and the Kenites were the same tribe. They were wandering
      smiths, &quot;the gipsies and travelling tinkers of the old
      Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age
      when the art of metallurgy was confined to a few&quot;
      (Sayce&#39;s Races, etc.). They showed kindness to Israel
      in their journey through the wilderness. They accompanied
      them in their march as far as Jericho (Judg. 1:16), and
      then returned to their old haunts among the Amalekites, in
      the desert to the south of Judah. They sustained afterwards
      friendly relations with the Israelites when settled in
      Canaan (Judg. 4:11, 17-21; 1 Sam. 27:10; 30:29). The
      Rechabites belonged to this tribe (1 Chr. 2:55) and in the
      days of Jeremiah (35:7-10) are referred to as following
      their nomad habits. Saul bade them depart from the
      Amalekites (1 Sam. 15:6) when, in obedience to the divine
      commission, he was about to &quot;smite Amalek.&quot; And
      his reason is, &quot;for ye showed kindness to all the
      children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&quot;
      Thus &quot;God is not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses
      shown to his people; but they shall be remembered another
      day, at the farthest in the great day, and recompensed in
      the resurrection of the just&quot; (M. Henry&#39;s

      (Gen. 15:19). They are not mentioned among the original
      inhabitants of Canaan (Ex. 3:8; Josh. 3:10), and probably
      they inhabited some part of Arabia, in the confines of
      Syria.</a>

      13:18, 21, as an article of apparel or ornament applied to
      the head of the idolatrous women of Israel. The precise
      meaning of the word is uncertain. It appears to have been a
      long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap themselves in
      (Ruth 3:15; Isa. 3:22). Some think that it was a long veil
      or head-dress, denoting by its form the position of those
      who wore it.</a>

      the south of Judah (Josh. 15:25). Judas the traitor was
      probably a native of this place, and hence his name
      Iscariot. It has been identified with the ruins of
      el-Kureitein, about 10 miles south of Hebron. (See HAZOR

      into the east country. Her nationality is unknown. She is
      styled &quot;Abraham&#39;s concubine&quot; (1 Chr. 1:32).

      the opener (Judg. 3:25); and in the Greek New Testament <i>
      kleis</i>, from its use in shutting (Matt. 16:19; Luke
      11:52; Rev. 1:18, etc.). Figures of ancient Egyptian keys

      locks and keys of wood, and of a large size (comp. Isa.

      comp. also Matt. 16:19; 18:18). The &quot;key of
      knowledge&quot; (Luke 11:52; comp. Matt. 23:13) is the
      means of attaining the knowledge regarding the kingdom of
      God. The &quot;power of the keys&quot; is a phrase in

      about 30 miles north-east of Sinai, and exactly a day&#39;s
      journey from &#39;Ain Hudherah.</a>

    <p>
      &quot;Here began the troubles of the journey. First,
      complaints broke out among the people, probably at the
      heat, the toil, and the privations of the march; and then
      God at once punished them by lightning, which fell on the
      hinder part of the camp, and killed many persons, but
      ceased at the intercession of Moses (Num. 11:1, 2). Then a
      disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but
      the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no
      high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people
      loathed the &#39;light food,&#39; and cried out to Moses,
      &#39;Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may
      eat.&#39;&quot; In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried
      unto God. An answer came. God sent &quot;a prodigious
      flight of quails, on which the people satiated their
      gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell
      on them: they loathed the food which they had desired; it
      bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the
      disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the
      consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in
      memory of man&#39;s sin and of the divine wrath this name,
      Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the
      place of their sepulchre&quot; (Num. 11:34, 35; 33:16, 17;

      its dam, a law which is thrice repeated (Ex. 23:19; 34:26;
      Deut. 14:21). Among the various reasons assigned for this
      law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which regards
      it as &quot;a protest against cruelty and outraging the
      order of nature.&quot; A kid cooked in its mother&#39;s
      milk is &quot;a gross, unwholesome dish, and calculated to
      kindle animal and ferocious passions, and on this account
      Moses may have forbidden it. Besides, it is even yet
      associated with immoderate feasting; and originally, I
      suspect,&quot; says Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book),
      &quot;was connected with idolatrous sacrifices.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0002187"><b>Kidron -</b> = Kedron = Cedron,
      turbid, the winter torrent which flows through the Valley
      of Jehoshaphat, on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between
      the city and the Mount of Olives. This valley is known in
      Scripture only by the name &quot;the brook Kidron.&quot;
      David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when
      fleeing from Absalom (2 Sam. 15:23, 30), and it was
      frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and
      fro (John 18:1). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his
      mother (1 Kings 15:13), and here Athaliah was executed (2
      Kings 11:16). It afterwards became the receptacle for all
      manner of impurities (2 Chr. 29:16; 30:14); and in the time
      of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city
      (2 Kings 23:6; comp. Jer. 26:23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this mountain ravine no water runs, except after
      heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem. Its
      length from its head to en-Rogel is 2 3/4 miles. Its
      precipitous, rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs,
      especially the left bank opposite the temple area. The
      greatest desire of the Jews is to be buried there, from the
      idea that the Kidron is the &quot;valley of
      Jehoshaphat&quot; mentioned in Joel 3:2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred
      interest. It runs in a winding course through the
      wilderness of Judea to the north-western shore of the Dead
      Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only some 20
      miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet.
      (See <a href=

      KEDRON</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the
      old bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its
      present bed, and about 70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall.

      <a name="T0002188"><b>Kinah -</b> an elegy, a city in the
      extreme south of Judah (Josh. 15:22). It was probably not
      far from the Dead Sea, in the Wady Fikreh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002189"><b>Kine -</b> (Heb. sing. parah, i.e.,
      &quot;fruitful&quot;), mentioned in Pharaoh&#39;s dream
      (Gen. 41: 18). Here the word denotes &quot;buffaloes,&quot;
      which fed on the reeds and sedge by the river&#39;s
      brink.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002190"><b>King -</b> is in Scripture very
      generally used to denote one invested with authority,
      whether extensive or limited. There were thirty-one kings
      in Canaan (Josh. 12:9, 24), whom Joshua subdued. Adonibezek
      subdued seventy kings (Judg. 1:7). In the New Testament the
      Roman emperor is spoken of as a king (1 Pet. 2:13, 17); and
      Herod Antipas, who was only a tetrarch, is also called a
      king (Matt. 14:9; Mark 6:22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This title is applied to God (1 Tim. 1:17), and to Christ,
      the Son of God (1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Matt. 27:11). The people
      of God are also called &quot;kings&quot; (Dan. 7:22, 27;
      Matt. 19:28; Rev. 1:6, etc.). Death is called the
      &quot;king of terrors&quot; (Job 18:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehovah was the sole King of the Jewish nation (1 Sam. 8:7;
      Isa. 33:22). But there came a time in the history of that
      people when a king was demanded, that they might be like
      other nations (1 Sam. 8:5). The prophet Samuel remonstrated
      with them, but the people cried out, &quot;Nay, but we will
      have a king over us.&quot; The misconduct of Samuel&#39;s
      sons was the immediate cause of this demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew kings did not rule in their own right, nor in
      name of the people who had chosen them, but partly as
      servants and partly as representatives of Jehovah, the true
      King of Israel (1 Sam. 10:1). The limits of the king&#39;s
      power were prescribed (1 Sam. 10:25). The officers of his
      court were, (1) the recorder or remembrancer (2 Sam. 8:16;
      1 Kings 4:3); (2) the scribe (2 Sam. 8:17; 20:25); (3) the
      officer over the house, the chief steward (Isa. 22:15); (4)
      the &quot;king&#39;s friend,&quot; a confidential companion
      (1 Kings 4:5); (5) the keeper of the wardrobe (2 Kings
      22:14); (6) captain of the bodyguard (2 Sam. 20:23); (7)
      officers over the king&#39;s treasures, etc. (1 Chr.
      27:25-31); (8) commander-in-chief of the army (1 Chr.
      27:34); (9) the royal counsellor (1 Chr. 27:32; 2 Sam.
      16:20-23).

      <a name="T0002191"><b>Kingdom of God -</b> (Matt. 6:33;
      Mark 1:14, 15; Luke 4:43) = &quot;kingdom of Christ&quot;
      (Matt. 13:41; 20:21) = &quot;kingdom of Christ and of
      God&quot; (Eph. 5:5) = &quot;kingdom of David&quot; (Mark
      11:10) = &quot;the kingdom&quot; (Matt. 8:12; 13:19) =
      &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; (Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 13:41), all
      denote the same thing under different aspects, viz.: (1)
      Christ&#39;s mediatorial authority, or his rule on the
      earth; (2) the blessings and advantages of all kinds that
      flow from this rule; (3) the subjects of this kingdom taken
      collectively, or the Church.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002192"><b>Kingly office of Christ -</b> one of
      the three special relations in which Christ stands to his
      people. Christ&#39;s office as mediator comprehends three
      different functions, viz., those of a prophet, priest, and
      king. These are not three distinct offices, but three
      functions of the one office of mediator.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ is King and sovereign Head over his Church and over
      all things to his Church (Eph. 1:22; 4:15; Col. 1:18;
      2:19). He executes this mediatorial kingship in his Church,
      and over his Church, and over all things in behalf of his
      Church. This royalty differs from that which essentially
      belongs to him as God, for it is given to him by the Father
      as the reward of his obedience and sufferings (Phil.
      2:6-11), and has as its especial object the upbuilding and
      the glory of his redeemed Church. It attaches, moreover,
      not to his divine nature as such, but to his person as
      God-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ&#39;s mediatorial kingdom may be regarded as
      comprehending, (1) his kingdom of power, or his
      providential government of the universe; (2) his kingdom of
      grace, which is wholly spiritual in its subjects and
      administration; and (3) his kingdom of glory, which is the
      consummation of all his providential and gracious
      administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ sustained and exercised the function of mediatorial
      King as well as of Prophet and Priest, from the time of the
      fall of man, when he entered on his mediatorial work; yet
      it may be said that he was publicly and formally enthroned
      when he ascended up on high and sat down at the
      Father&#39;s right hand (Ps. 2:6; Jer. 23:5; Isa. 9:6),
      after his work of humiliation and suffering on earth was
      &quot;finished.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002193"><b>King&#39;s dale -</b> mentioned only
      in Gen. 14:17; 2 Sam. 18:18, the name given to &quot;the
      valley of Shaveh,&quot; where the king of Sodom met
      Abram.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002194"><b>Kings, The Books of -</b> The two
      books of Kings formed originally but one book in the Hebrew
      Scriptures. The present division into two books was first
      made by the LXX., which now, with the Vulgate, numbers them
      as the third and fourth books of Kings, the two books of
      Samuel being the first and second books of Kings.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      They contain the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the
      accession of Solomon till the subjugation of the kingdom by
      Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians (apparently a period of
      about four hundred and fifty-three years). The books of
      Chronicles (q.v.) are more comprehensive in their contents
      than those of Kings. The latter synchronize with 1 Chr.
      28-2 Chr. 36:21. While in the Chronicles greater prominence
      is given to the priestly or Levitical office, in the Kings
      greater prominence is given to the kingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The authorship of these books is uncertain. There are some
      portions of them and of Jeremiah that are almost identical,
      e.g., 2 Kings 24:18-25 and Jer. 52; 39:1-10; 40:7-41:10.
      There are also many undesigned coincidences between
      Jeremiah and Kings (2 Kings 21-23 and Jer. 7:15; 15:4;
      19:3, etc.), and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah
      had personal knowledge. These facts countenance in some
      degree the tradition that Jeremiah was the author of the
      books of Kings. But the more probable supposition is that
      Ezra, after the Captivity, compiled them from documents
      written perhaps by David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo,
      and that he arranged them in the order in which they now
      exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the threefold division of the Scriptures by the Jews,
      these books are ranked among the &quot;Prophets.&quot; They
      are frequently quoted or alluded to by our Lord and his
      apostles (Matt. 6:29; 12:42; Luke 4:25, 26; 10:4; comp. 2
      Kings 4:29; Mark 1:6; comp. 2 Kings 1:8; Matt. 3:4, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sources of the narrative are referred to (1) &quot;the
      book of the acts of Solomon&quot; (1 Kings 11:41); (2) the
      &quot;book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah&quot;
      (14:29; 15:7, 23, etc.); (3) the &quot;book of the
      chronicles of the kings of Israel&quot; (14:19; 15:31;
      16:14, 20, 27, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The date of its composition was some time between B.C. 561,
      the date of the last chapter (2 Kings 25), when Jehoiachin
      was released from captivity by Evil-merodach, and B.C. 538,
      the date of the decree of deliverance by Cyrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002195"><b>Kinsman -</b> Heb. goel, from root
      meaning to redeem. The goel among the Hebrews was the
      nearest male blood relation alive. Certain important
      obligations devolved upon him toward his next of kin. (1.)
      If any one from poverty was unable to redeem his
      inheritance, it was the duty of the kinsman to redeem it
      (Lev. 25:25,28; Ruth 3:9, 12). He was also required to
      redeem his relation who had sold himself into slavery (Lev.
      25:48, 49).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      God is the Goel of his people because he redeems them (Ex.
      6:6; Isa. 43:1; 41:14; 44:6, 22; 48:20; Ps. 103:4; Job
      19:25, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The goel also was the avenger (q.v.) of blood (Num.
      35:21) in the case of the murder of the next of kin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002196"><b>Kir -</b> a wall or fortress, a place
      to which Tiglath-pileser carried the Syrians captive after
      he had taken the city of Damascus (2 Kings 16:9; Amos 1:5;
      9:7). Isaiah (22:6), who also was contemporary with these
      events, mentions it along with Elam. Some have supposed
      that Kir is a variant of Cush (Susiana), on the south of
      Elam.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002197"><b>Kir-haraseth -</b> built fortress, a
      city and fortress of Moab, the modern Kerak, a small town
      on the brow of a steep hill about 6 miles from Rabbath-Moab
      and 10 miles from the Dead Sea; called also Kir-haresh,
      Kir-hareseth, Kir-heres (Isa. 16:7, 11; Jer. 48:31, 36).
      After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab (see MOABITE
      STONE &macr;T0002586), threw off allegiance to the king of
      Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his
      kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to
      regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance
      with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom.
      The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was
      driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites
      were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who
      would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a
      burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of
      the allied armies. &quot;There was great indignation
      against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to
      their own land.&quot; The invaders evacuated the land of
      Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country (2
      Kings 3:20-27).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002198"><b>Kirjath -</b> city, a city belonging
      to Benjamin (Josh. 18:28), the modern Kuriet el-&#39;Enab,
      i.e., &quot;city of grapes&quot;, about 7 1/2 miles
      west-north-west of Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002199"><b>Kirjathaim -</b> two cities; a double
      city. (1.) A city of refuge in Naphtali (1 Chr. 6:76).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A town on the east of Jordan (Gen. 14:5; Deut. 2:9,
      10). It was assigned to the tribe of Reuben (Num. 32:37).
      In the time of Ezekiel (25:9) it was one of the four cities
      which formed the &quot;glory of Moab&quot; (comp. Jer.
      48:1, 23). It has been identified with el-Kureiyat, 11
      miles south-west of Medeba, on the south slope of Jebel
      Attarus, the ancient Ataroth.
