      <a name="T0002200"><b>Kirjath-arba -</b> city of Arba, the
      original name of Hebron (q.v.), so called from the name of
      its founder, one of the Anakim (Gen. 23:2; 35:27; Josh.
      15:13). It was given to Caleb by Joshua as his portion. The
      Jews interpret the name as meaning &quot;the city of the
      four&quot;, i.e., of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Adam, who
      were all, as they allege, buried there.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002201"><b>Kirjath-huzoth -</b> city of streets,
      Num. 22:39, a Moabite city, which some identify with
      Kirjathaim. Balak here received and entertained Balaam,
      whom he had invited from Pethor, among the &quot;mountains
      of the east,&quot; beyond the Euphrates, to lay his ban
      upon the Israelites, whose progress he had no hope
      otherwise of arresting. It was probably from the summit of
      Attarus, the high place near the city, that the soothsayer
      first saw the encampments of Israel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002202"><b>Kirjath-jearim -</b> city of jaars;
      i.e., of woods or forests, a Gibeonite town (Josh. 9:17) on
      the border of Benjamin, to which tribe it was assigned
      (18:15, 28). The ark was brought to this place (1 Sam. 7:1,
      2) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of Abinadab, a
      Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to
      Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:2, 3, 12; 1 Chr. 15:1-29; comp. Ps.
      132). It was also called Baalah (Josh. 15:9) and
      Kirjath-baal (60). It has been usually identified with
      Kuriet el-&#39;Enab (i.e., &quot;city of grapes&quot;),
      among the hills, about 8 miles north-east of &#39;Ain Shems
      (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however, that it is to
      be identified with &#39;Erma, 4 miles east of &#39;Ain
      Shems, on the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be
      better supported. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002100.html&amp;from=T0002198&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      KIRJATH</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of Ps. 132:6, &quot;We found it in the fields of
      the wood,&quot; refer to the sojourn of the ark at
      Kirjath-jearim. &quot;Wood&quot; is here the rendering of
      the Hebrew word <i>jaar</i>, which is the singular of <i>
      jearim</i>.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002203"><b>Kirjath-sannah -</b> city of the
      sannah; i.e., of the palm(?), Josh. 15:49; the same as
      Kirjath-sepher (15:16; Judg. 1:11) and Debir (q.v.), a
      Canaanitish royal city included in Judah (Josh. 10:38;
      15:49), and probably the chief seat of learning among the
      Hittites. It was about 12 miles to the south-west of
      Hebron.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002204"><b>Kirjath-sepher -</b> city of books,
      Josh. 15:15; same as Kirjath-sannah (q.v.), now represented
      by the valley of ed-Dhaberiyeh, south-west of Hebron. The
      name of this town is an evidence that the Canaanites were
      acquainted with writing and books. &quot;The town probably
      contained a noted school, or was the site of an oracle and
      the residence of some learned priest.&quot; The
      &quot;books&quot; were probably engraved stones or
      bricks.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002205"><b>Kir of Moab -</b> Isa. 15:1. The two
      strongholds of Moab were Ar and Kir, which latter is
      probably the Kir-haraseth (16:7) following.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002206"><b>Kish -</b> a bow. (1.) A Levite of
      the family of Merari (1 Chr. 23:21; 24:29).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Benjamite of Jerusalem (1 Chr. 8:30; 9:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A Levite in the time of Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The great-grandfather of Mordecai (Esther 2:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) A Benjamite, the son of Abiel, and father of king Saul
      (1 Sam. 9:1, 3; 10:11, 21; 14:51; 2 Sam. 21:14). All that
      is recorded of him is that he sent his son Saul in search
      of his asses that had strayed, and that he was buried in
      Zelah. Called Cis, Acts 13:21 (R.V., Kish).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002207"><b>Kishion -</b> hardness, a city of
      Issachar assigned to the Gershonite Levites (Josh. 19:20),
      the same as Kishon (21:28).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002208"><b>Kishon -</b> winding, a winter
      torrent of Central Palestine, which rises about the roots
      of Tabor and Gilboa, and passing in a northerly direction
      through the plains of Esdraelon and Acre, falls into the
      Mediterranean at the north-eastern corner of the bay of
      Acre, at the foot of Carmel. It is the drain by which the
      waters of the plain of Esdraelon and of the mountains that
      surround it find their way to the sea. It bears the modern
      name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., &quot;the river of
      slaughter&quot; (comp. 1 Kings 18:40). In the triumphal
      song of Deborah (Judg. 5:21) it is spoken of as &quot;that
      ancient river,&quot; either (1) because it had flowed on
      for ages, or (2), according to the Targum, because it was
      &quot;the torrent in which were shown signs and wonders to
      Israel of old;&quot; or (3) probably the reference is to
      the exploits in that region among the ancient Canaanites,
      for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great
      battle-field of Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the scene of the defeat of Sisera (Judg. 4:7, 13),
      and of the destruction of the prophets of Baal by Elijah (1
      Kings 18:40). &quot;When the Kishon was at its height, it
      would be, partly on account of its quicksands, as
      impassable as the ocean itself to a retreating army.&quot;

      <a name="T0002209"><b>Kiss -</b> of affection (Gen. 27:26,
      27; 29:13; Luke 7:38, 45); reconciliation (Gen. 33:4; 2
      Sam. 14:33); leave-taking (Gen. 31:28,55; Ruth 1:14; 2 Sam.
      19:39); homage (Ps. 2:12; 1 Sam. 10:1); spoken of as
      between parents and children (Gen. 27:26; 31:28, 55; 48:10;
      50:1; Ex. 18:7; Ruth 1:9, 14); between male relatives (Gen.
      29:13; 33:4; 45:15). It accompanied social worship as a
      symbol of brotherly love (Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 16:20; 2 Cor.
      13:12; 1 Thess. 5:26; 1 Pet. 5:14). The worship of idols
      was by kissing the image or the hand toward the image (1
      Kings 19:18; Hos. 13:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002210"><b>Kite -</b> an unclean and
      keen-sighted bird of prey (Lev. 11:14; Deut. 14:13). The
      Hebrew word used, <i>&#39;ayet</i>, is rendered
      &quot;vulture&quot; in Job 28:7 in Authorized Version,
      &quot;falcon&quot; in Revised Version. It is probably the
      red kite (Milvus regalis), a bird of piercing sight and of
      soaring habits found all over Palestine.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002211"><b>Kithlish -</b> a man&#39;s wall, a
      town in the plain of Judah (Josh. 15:40). It has been
      identified with Jelameh.</a>

      process of baking (Gen. 18:6; 1 Sam. 28:24; Hos. 7:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002215"><b>Kneading-trough -</b> the vessel in
      which the dough, after being mixed and leavened, was left
      to swell or ferment (Ex. 8:3; 12:34; Deut. 28:5, 7). The
      dough in the vessels at the time of the Exodus was still
      unleavened, because the people were compelled to withdraw
      in haste.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002216"><b>Knife -</b> (1.) Heb. hereb,
      &quot;the waster,&quot; a sharp instrument for circumcision
      (Josh. 5:2, 3, lit. &quot;knives of flint;&quot; comp. Ex.
      4:25); a razor (Ezek. 5:1); a graving tool (Ex. 20:25); an
      axe (Ezek. 26:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. maakeleth, a large knife for slaughtering and
      cutting up food (Gen. 22:6, 10; Prov. 30:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. sakkin, a knife for any purpose, a table knife
      (Prov. 23:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. mahalaph, a butcher&#39;s knife for slaughtering
      the victims offered in sacrifice (Ezra 1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Smaller knives (Heb. ta&#39;ar, Jer. 36:26) were used
      for sharpening pens. The pruning-knives mentioned in Isa.
      18:5 (Heb. mizmaroth) were probably curved knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002217"><b>Knock -</b> &quot;Though Orientals
      are very jealous of their privacy, they never knock when
      about to enter your room, but walk in without warning or
      ceremony. It is nearly impossible to teach an Arab servant
      to knock at your door. They give warning at the outer gate
      either by calling or knocking. To stand and call is a very
      common and respectful mode. Thus Moses commanded the holder
      of a pledge to stand without and call to the owner to come
      forth (Deut. 24:10). This was to avoid the violent
      intrusion of cruel creditors. Peter stood knocking at the
      outer door (Acts 12:13, 16), and the three men sent to
      Joppa by Cornelius made inquiry and &#39;stood before the
      gate&#39; (10:17, 18). The idea is that the guard over your
      privacy is to be placed at the entrance.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Knocking is used as a sign of importunity (Matt. 7:7, 8;
      Luke 13:25), and of the coming of Christ (Luke 12:36; Rev.
      3:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002218"><b>Knop -</b> some architectural
      ornament. (1.) Heb. kaphtor (Ex. 25:31-36), occurring in
      the description of the candlestick. It was an ornamental
      swell beneath the cups of the candlestick, probably an
      imitation of the fruit of the almond.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. peka&#39;im, found only in 1 Kings 6:18 and 7:24,
      an ornament resembling a small gourd or an egg, on the
      cedar wainscot in the temple and on the castings on the
      brim of the brazen sea.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002219"><b>Koa -</b> he-camel, occurs only in
      Ezek. 23:23, some province or place in the Babylonian
      empire, used in this passage along with Shoa (q.v.).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002220"><b>Kohath -</b> assembly, the second son
      of Levi, and father of Amram (Gen. 46:11). He came down to
      Egypt with Jacob, and lived to the age of one hundred and
      thirty-three years (Ex. 6:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002221"><b>Kohathites -</b> the descendants of
      Kohath. They formed the first of the three divisions of the
      Levites (Ex. 6:16, 18; Num. 3:17). In the journeyings of
      the Israelites they had the charge of the most holy portion
      of the vessels of the tabernacle, including the ark (Num.
      4). Their place in the marching and encampment was south of
      the tabernacle (Num. 3:29, 31). Their numbers at different
      times are specified (3:28; 4:36; 26:57, 62). Samuel was of
      this division.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002222"><b>Korah -</b> ice, hail. (1.) The third
      son of Esau, by Aholibamah (Gen. 36:14; 1 Chr. 1:35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite, the son of Izhar, the brother of Amram, the
      father of Moses and Aaron (Ex. 6:21). The institution of
      the Aaronic priesthood and the Levitical service at Sinai
      was a great religious revolution. The old priesthood of the
      heads of families passed away. This gave rise to murmurings
      and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at
      Kadesh for the first time, which came to a head in a
      rebellion against Moses and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan,
      and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, &quot;men of
      renown&quot; i.e., well-known men from among the other
      tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded
      of Moses and Aaron that the old state of things should be
      restored, alleging that &quot;they took too much upon
      them&quot; (Num. 16:1-3). On the morning after the
      outbreak, Korah and his associates presented themselves at
      the door of the tabernacle, and &quot;took every man his
      censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense
      thereon.&quot; But immediately &quot;fire from the
      Lord&quot; burst forth and destroyed them all (Num. 16:35).
      Dathan and Abiram &quot;came out and stood in the door of
      their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their
      little children,&quot; and it came to pass &quot;that the
      ground clave asunder that was under them; and the earth
      opened her mouth and swallowed them up.&quot; A plague
      thereafter began among the people who sympathized in the
      rebellion, and was only stayed by Aaron&#39;s appearing
      between the living and the dead, and making &quot;an
      atonement for the people&quot; (16:47).
    </p>
    <p>
      The descendants of the sons of Korah who did not
      participate in the rebellion afterwards rose to eminence in
      the Levitical service.

      <a name="T0002223"><b>Korahites -</b> that portion of the
      Kohathites that descended from Korah. (1.) They were an
      important branch of the singers of the Kohathite division
      (2 Chr. 20:19). There are eleven psalms (42-49; 84; 85; 87;
      88) dedicated to the sons of Korah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Some of the sons of Korah also were
      &quot;porters&quot; of the temple (1 Chr. 9:17-19); one of
      them was over &quot;things that were made in the pans&quot;

      destroyed by the Israelites (Josh. 10:31-33). It afterwards
      became, under Rehoboam, one of the strongest fortresses of
      Judah (2 Chr. 10:9). It was assaulted and probably taken by
      Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:14, 17; 19:8; Isa. 36:2). An
      account of this siege is given on some slabs found in the

      Lachish has been identified with Tell-el-Hesy, where a
      cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a letter
      supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of
      the Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This
      letter is from the chief of Atim (=Etam, 1 Chr. 4:32) to
      the chief of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great
      alarm at the approach of marauders from the Hebron hills.
      &quot;They have entered the land,&quot; he says, &quot;to
      lay waste...strong is he who has come down. He lays
      waste.&quot; This letter shows that &quot;the communication
      by tablets in cuneiform script was not only usual in
      writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence of the
      country. The letter, though not so important in some ways
      as the Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the
      most valuable discoveries ever made in Palestine&quot;
      (Conder&#39;s Tell Amarna Tablets, p. 134).
    </p>
    <p>
      Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other
      discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and
      ashes, which is supposed to have existed B.C. 1500. If the
      theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air
      blast instead of cold air (an improvement in iron
      manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known fifteen
      hundred years before Christ. (See <a href=

      poetry. It has been called &quot;Lamech&#39;s

      8:10). In 2 Sam. 3:33, 34 is recorded David&#39;s lament
      over Abner. Prophecy sometimes took the form of a lament
      when it predicted calamity (Ezek. 27:2, 32; 28:12; 32:2,

      the Hebrew canon <i>&#39;Ekhah</i>, meaning
      &quot;How,&quot; being the formula for the commencement of
      a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see 2
      Sam. 1:19-27). The LXX. adopted the name rendered
      &quot;Lamentations&quot; (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth) now in
      common use, to denote the character of the book, in which
      the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on the city
      and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is
      placed among the Khethubim. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000500.html&amp;from=T0000580&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">

    <p>
      As to its authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in
      following the LXX. and the Targum in ascribing it to
      Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter
      are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning
      it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the
      destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern
      outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That
      cavern is still pointed out. &quot;In the face of a rocky
      hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has
      placed &#39;the grotto of Jeremiah.&#39; There, in that
      fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has
      immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have
      mourned the fall of his country&quot; (Stanley, Jewish
      Church).
    </p>
    <p>
      The book consists of five separate poems. In chapter 1 the
      prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which
      the city sits as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In
      chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with
      the national sins that had caused them. Chapter 3 speaks of
      hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be
      for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4
      laments the ruin and desolation that had come upon the city
      and temple, but traces it only to the people&#39;s sins.
      Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion&#39;s reproach may be taken
      away in the repentance and recovery of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first four poems (chapters) are acrostics, like some of
      the Psalms (25, 34, 37, 119), i.e., each verse begins with
      a letter of the Hebrew alphabet taken in order. The first,
      second, and fourth have each twenty-two verses, the number
      of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The third has
      sixty-six verses, in which each three successive verses
      begin with the same letter. The fifth is not acrostic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the &quot;Wailing-place (q.v.) of the
      Jews&quot; at Jerusalem, a portion of the old wall of the
      temple of Solomon, Schaff says: &quot;There the Jews
      assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail the downfall of
      the holy city, kissing the stone wall and watering it with
      their tears. They repeat from their well-worn Hebrew Bibles
      and prayer-books the Lamentations of Jeremiah and suitable
      Psalms.&quot;

      banks of the Lycus. It was originally called Diospolis and
      then Rhoas, but afterwards Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife
      of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who rebuilt it. It was one
      of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor.
      At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of
      Christianity (Col. 2:1; 4:15; Rev. 1:11, etc.). It is now a
      deserted place, called by the Turks Eski-hissar or

      generally regarded as denoting the hoope (Upupa epops), an
      onomatopoetic word derived from the cry of the bird, which

      cooking (1 Sam. 2:14), a &quot;fire-pan&quot; or hearth
      (Zech. 12:6), the sacred wash-bowl of the tabernacle and

      30, etc.), a basin for the water used by the priests in
      their ablutions.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      That which was originally used in the tabernacle was of
      brass (rather copper; Heb. nihsheth), made from the metal
      mirrors the women brought out of Egypt (Ex. 38:8). It
      contained water wherewith the priests washed their hands
      and feet when they entered the tabernacle (40:32). It stood
      in the court between the altar and the door of the
      tabernacle (30:19, 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the temple there were ten lavers used for the
      sacrifices, and the molten sea for the ablutions of the
      priests (2 Chr. 4:6). The position and uses of these are
      described 1 Kings 7:23-39; 2 Chr. 4:6. The &quot;molten
      sea&quot; was made of copper, taken from Tibhath and Chun,
      cities of Hadarezer, king of Zobah (1 Chr. 18:8; 1 Kings
      7:23-26).

      Law of Nature is the will of God as to human conduct,
      founded on the moral difference of things, and discoverable
      by natural light (Rom. 1:20; 2:14, 15). This law binds all
      men at all times. It is generally designated by the term
      conscience, or the capacity of being influenced by the
      moral relations of things.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The Ceremonial Law prescribes under the Old Testament
      the rites and ceremonies of worship. This law was
      obligatory only till Christ, of whom these rites were
      typical, had finished his work (Heb. 7:9, 11; 10:1; Eph.
      2:16). It was fulfilled rather than abrogated by the

      conduct, binding on all men to the end of time. It was
      promulgated at Sinai. It is perfect (Ps. 19:7), perpetual
      (Matt. 5:17, 18), holy (Rom. 7:12), good, spiritual (14),
      and exceeding broad (Ps. 119:96). Although binding on all,

      Eleazar, whom God helps. (1.) The brother of Mary and
      Martha of Bethany. He was raised from the dead after he had
      lain four days in the tomb (John 11:1-44). This miracle so
      excited the wrath of the Jews that they sought to put both

      mentioned Gen. 8:11. The barren fig-tree had nothing but
      leaves (Matt. 21:19; Mark 11:13). The oak-leaf is mentioned
      Isa. 1:30; 6:13. There are numerous allusions to leaves,
      their flourishing, their decay, and their restoration (Lev.
      26:36; Isa. 34:4; Jer. 8:13; Dan. 4:12, 14, 21; Mark 11:13;
      13:28). The fresh leaf is a symbol of prosperity (Ps. 1:3;
      Jer. 17:8; Ezek. 47:12); the faded, of decay (Job 13:25;
      Isa. 1:30; 64:6; Jer. 8:13).</a>

      The Jews were forbidden to enter into an alliance of any
      kind (1) with the Canaanites (Ex. 23:32, 33; 34:12-16); (2)
      with the Amalekites (Ex. 17:8, 14; Deut. 25:17-19); (3)
      with the Moabites and Ammonites (Deut. 2:9, 19). Treaties
      were permitted to be entered into with all other nations.
      Thus David maintained friendly intercourse with the kings
      of Tyre and Hamath, and Solomon with the kings of Tyre and
      Egypt.</a>

      <a name="T0002255"><b>Leah -</b> weary, the eldest daughter
      of Laban, and sister of Rachel (Gen. 29:16). Jacob took her
      to wife through a deceit of her father (Gen. 29:23). She
      was &quot;tender-eyed&quot; (17). She bore to Jacob six
      sons (32-35), also one daughter, Dinah (30:21). She
      accompanied Jacob into Canaan, and died there before the
      time of the going down into Egypt (Gen. 31), and was buried
      in the cave of Machpelah (49:31).</a>

      &quot;Mahalath (q.v.) Leannoth&quot; may be rendered
      &quot;concerning sickness, to be sung&quot; i.e., perhaps,
      to be sung in sickness.</a>

      kazabh</i> is generally rendered.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002258"><b>Leather -</b> a girdle of, worn by
      Elijah (2 Kings 1:8) and John the Baptist (Matt. 3:4).
      Leather was employed both for clothing (Num. 31:20; Heb.
      11:37) and for writing upon. The trade of a tanner is
      mentioned (Acts 9:43; 10:6, 32). It was probably learned in
      Egypt.</a>

      <a name="T0002259"><b>Leaven -</b> (1.) Heb. seor (Ex.
      12:15, 19; 13:7; Lev. 2:11), the remnant of dough from the
      preceding baking which had fermented and become acid.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. hamets, properly &quot;ferment.&quot; In Num.
      6:3, &quot;vinegar of wine&quot; is more correctly
      &quot;fermented wine.&quot; In Ex. 13:7, the proper
      rendering would be, &quot;Unfermented things [Heb.
      matstsoth] shall be consumed during the seven days; and
      there shall not be seen with thee fermented things
      [hamets], and there shall not be seen with thee leavened
      mass [seor] in all thy borders.&quot; The chemical
      definition of ferment or yeast is &quot;a substance in a
      state of putrefaction, the atoms of which are in a
      continual motion.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of leaven was strictly forbidden in all offerings
      made to the Lord by fire (Lev. 2:11; 7:12; 8:2; Num. 6:15).
      Its secretly penetrating and diffusive power is referred to
      in 1 Cor. 5:6. In this respect it is used to illustrate the
      growth of the kingdom of heaven both in the individual
      heart and in the world (Matt. 13:33). It is a figure also
      of corruptness and of perverseness of heart and life (Matt.
      16:6, 11; Mark 8:15; 1 Cor. 5:7, 8).

      <a name="T0002260"><b>Lebanon -</b> white, &quot;the white
      mountain of Syria,&quot; is the loftiest and most
      celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running
      southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking
      into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and
      the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley
      (Josh. 11:17) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by
      Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka&#39;a,
      &quot;the valley,&quot; a prolongation of the valley of the
      Jordan.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern
      extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany,
      and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean
      coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of
      Emesa, &quot;the entering of Hamath&quot; (Num. 34:8; 1
      Kings 8:65), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent.
      The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000
      feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and
      the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with
      perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild
      beasts as of old still abound (2 Kings 14:9; Cant. 4:8).
      The scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur
      and beauty, and supplied the sacred writers with many
      expressive similes (Ps. 29:5, 6; 72:16; 104:16-18; Cant.
      4:15; Isa. 2:13; 35:2; 60:13; Hos. 14:5). It is famous for
      its cedars (Cant. 5:15), its wines (Hos. 14:7), and its
      cool waters (Jer. 18:14). The ancient inhabitants were
      Giblites and Hivites (Josh. 13:5; Judg. 3:3). It was part
      of the Phoenician kingdom (1 Kings 5:2-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or &quot;Lebanon
      towards the sunrising,&quot; runs nearly parallel with the
      western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the
      hills of Galilee in the south. The height of this range is
      about 5,000 feet. Its highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from
      which a number of lesser ranges radiate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the
      boundary of Palestine (Deut. 1:7; 11:24). It was assigned
      to Israel, but was never conquered (Josh. 13:2-6; Judg.
      3:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a population of about
      300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is ruled by
      a Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by
      Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler.

      of Judas (Jude), one of the twelve (Matt. 10:3), called
      also Thaddaeus, not to be confounded with the Judas who was
      the brother of our Lord.</a>

      <a name="T0002262"><b>Lebonah -</b> frankincense, a town
      near Shiloh, on the north side of Bethel (Judg. 21:19). It
      has been identified with el-Lubban, to the south of
      Nablus.</a>

      <a name="T0002263"><b>Leek -</b> (Heb. hatsir; the Allium
      porrum), rendered &quot;grass&quot; in 1 Kings 18:5, 2
      Kings 19:26, Job 40:15, etc.; &quot;herb&quot; in Job 8:12;
      &quot;hay&quot; in Prov. 27:25, and Isa. 15:6;
      &quot;leeks&quot; only in Num. 11:5. This Hebrew word seems
      to denote in this last passage simply herbs, such as
      lettuce or savoury herbs cooked as kitchen vegetables, and
      not necessarily what are now called leeks. The leek was a
      favourite vegetable in Egypt, and is still largely
      cultivated there and in Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002264"><b>Lees -</b> (Heb. shemarim), from a
      word meaning to keep or preserve. It was applied to
      &quot;lees&quot; from the custom of allowing wine to stand
      on the lees that it might thereby be better preserved (Isa.
      25:6). &quot;Men settled on their lees&quot; (Zeph. 1:12)
      are men &quot;hardened or crusted.&quot; The image is
      derived from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long
      left undisturbed (Jer. 48:11). The effect of wealthy
      undisturbed ease on the ungodly is hardening. They become
      stupidly secure (comp. Ps. 55:19; Amos 6:1). To drink the
      lees (Ps. 75:8) denotes severe suffering.</a>

      <a name="T0002265"><b>Left hand -</b> among the Hebrews,
      denoted the north (Job 23:9; Gen. 14:15), the face of the

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002266"><b>Left-handed -</b> (Judg. 3:15;
      20:16), one unable to use the right hand skilfully, and who
      therefore uses the left; and also one who uses the left as
      well as the right, ambidexter. Such a condition of the
      hands is due to physical causes. This quality was common
      apparently in the tribe of Benjamin.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002267"><b>Legion -</b> a regiment of the Roman
      army, the number of men composing which differed at
      different times. It originally consisted of three thousand
      men, but in the time of Christ consisted of six thousand,
      exclusive of horsemen, who were in number a tenth of the
      foot-men. The word is used (Matt. 26:53; Mark 5:9) to
      express simply a great multitude.</a>

      <a name="T0002268"><b>Lehi -</b> a jawbone, a place in the
      tribe of Judah where Samson achieved a victory over the
      Philistines (Judg. 15:9, 14, 16), slaying a thousand of
      them with the jawbone of an ass. The words in 15:19,
      &quot;a hollow place that was in the jaw&quot; (A.V.),
      should be, as in Revised Version, &quot;the hollow place
      that is in Lehi.&quot;</a>

      species of vetch (Gen. 25:34; 2 Sam. 23:11), common in
      Syria under the name addas. The red pottage made by Jacob
      was of lentils (Gen. 25:29-34). They were among the
      provisions brought to David when he fled from Absalom (2
      Sam. 17:28). It is the Ervum lens of Linnaeus, a leguminous
      plant which produces a fruit resembling a bean.</a>

      <a name="T0002271"><b>Leopard -</b> (Heb. namer, so called
      because spotted, Cant. 4:8), was that great spotted feline
      which anciently infested the mountains of Syria, more
      appropriately called a panther (Felis pardus). Its
      fierceness (Isa. 11:6), its watching for its prey (Jer.
      5:6), its swiftness (Hab. 1:8), and the spots of its skin
      (Jer. 13:23), are noticed. This word is used symbolically
      (Dan. 7:6; Rev. 13:2).</a>

      <a name="T0002272"><b>Leprosy -</b> (Heb. tsara&#39;ath, a
      &quot;smiting,&quot; a &quot;stroke,&quot; because the
      disease was regarded as a direct providential infliction).
      This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek
      physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We
      have the description of the disease, as well as the
      regulations connected with it, in Lev. 13; 14; Num.
      12:10-15, etc. There were reckoned six different
      circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1)
      without any apparent cause (Lev. 13:2-8); (2) its
      reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4)
      on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots
      (38, 39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head
      (40-44).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city (Num.
      5:1-4; 12:10-15, etc.). This disease was regarded as an
      awful punishment from the Lord (2 Kings 5:7; 2 Chr. 26:20).

    <p>
      This disease &quot;begins with specks on the eyelids and on
      the palms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the
      hair white wherever they appear, crusting the affected
      parts with white scales, and causing terrible sores and
      swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the
      bones, rotting the whole body piecemeal.&quot; &quot;In
      Christ&#39;s day no leper could live in a walled town,
      though he might in an open village. But wherever he was he
      was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of
      deep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with
      his mantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death.
      He had further to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by
      calling out, &#39;Unclean! unclean!&#39; nor could he speak
      to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since in the
      East this involves an embrace.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      That the disease was not contagious is evident from the
      regulations regarding it (Lev. 13:12, 13, 36; 2 Kings 5:1).
      Leprosy was &quot;the outward and visible sign of the
      innermost spiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small
      beginnings, its gradual spread, its internal disfigurement,
      its dissolution little by little of the whole body, of that
      which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man&#39;s inner
      nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a
      pure and holy God&quot; (Maclear&#39;s Handbook O.T). Our
      Lord cured lepers (Matt. 8:2, 3; Mark 1:40-42). This divine
      power so manifested illustrates his gracious dealings with
      men in curing the leprosy of the soul, the fatal taint of
      sin.

      mentioned as taking a prominent part in avenging his sister

      of Authorized Version, it denotes the dragon which,
      according to Eastern tradition, is an enemy of light; in
      41:1 the crocodile is meant; in Ps. 104:26 it &quot;denotes
      any large animal that moves by writhing or wriggling the
      body, the whale, the monsters of the deep.&quot; This word
      is also used figuratively for a cruel enemy, as some think
      &quot;the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power, and

    </p>
    <p>
      When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of
      worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each
      house inheriting the priest&#39;s office. At Sinai the
      first change in this ancient practice was made. A
      hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron was then
      instituted (Ex. 28:1). But it was not till that terrible
      scene in connection with the sin of the golden calf that
      the tribe of Levi stood apart and began to occupy a
      distinct position (Ex. 32). The religious primogeniture was
      then conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devoted
      to the service of the sanctuary (Num. 3:11-13). They were
      selected for this purpose because of their zeal for the
      glory of God (Ex. 32:26), and because, as the tribe to
      which Moses and Aaron belonged, they would naturally stand
      by the lawgiver in his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of
      Levi&#39;s three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst
      Aaron, Amram&#39;s son (Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue
      constituted the priestly order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The age and qualification for Levitical service are
      specified in Num. 4:3, 23, 30, 39, 43, 47.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not included among the armies of Israel (Num.
      1:47; 2:33; 26:62), but were reckoned by themselves. They
      were the special guardians of the tabernacle (Num. 1:51;
      18:22-24). The Gershonites pitched their tents on the west
      of the tabernacle (3:23), the Kohathites on the south
      (3:29), the Merarites on the north (3:35), and the priests
      on the east (3:38). It was their duty to move the tent and
      carry the parts of the sacred structure from place to
      place. They were given to Aaron and his sons the priests to
      wait upon them and do work for them at the sanctuary
      services (Num. 8:19; 18:2-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      As being wholly consecrated to the service of the Lord,
      they had no territorial possessions. Jehovah was their
      inheritance (Num. 18:20; 26:62; Deut. 10:9; 18:1, 2), and
      for their support it was ordained that they should receive
      from the other tribes the tithes of the produce of the
      land. Forty-eight cities also were assigned to them,
      thirteen of which were for the priests &quot;to dwell
      in&quot;, i.e., along with their other inhabitants. Along
      with their dwellings they had &quot;suburbs&quot;, i.e.,
      &quot;commons&quot;, for their herds and flocks, and also
      fields and vineyards (Num. 35:2-5). Nine of these cities
      were in Judah, three in Naphtali, and four in each of the
      other tribes (Josh. 21). Six of the Levitical cities were
      set apart as &quot;cities of refuge&quot; (q.v.). Thus the
      Levites were scattered among the tribes to keep alive among
      them the knowledge and service of God. (See <a href=

      Pentateuch; so called in the Vulgate, after the LXX.,
      because it treats chiefly of the Levitical service.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first section of the book (1-17), which exhibits the
      worship itself, there is, (1.) A series of laws (1-7)
      regarding sacrifices, burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and
      thank-offerings (1-3), sin-offerings and trespass-offerings
      (4; 5), followed by the law of the priestly duties in
      connection with the offering of sacrifices (6; 7). (2.) An
      historical section (8-10), giving an account of the
      consecration of Aaron and his sons (8); Aaron&#39;s first
      offering for himself and the people (9); Nadab and
      Abihu&#39;s presumption in offering &quot;strange fire
      before Jehovah,&quot; and their punishment (10). (3.) Laws
      concerning purity, and the sacrifices and ordinances for
      putting away impurity (11-16). An interesting fact may be
      noted here. Canon Tristram, speaking of the remarkable
      discoveries regarding the flora and fauna of the Holy Land
      by the Palestine Exploration officers, makes the following
      statement:, &quot;Take these two catalogues of the clean
      and unclean animals in the books of Leviticus [11] and
      Deuteronomy [14]. There are eleven in Deuteronomy which do
      not occur in Leviticus, and these are nearly all animals
      and birds which are not found in Egypt or the Holy Land,
      but which are numerous in the Arabian desert. They are not
      named in Leviticus a few weeks after the departure from
      Egypt; but after the people were thirty-nine years in the
      desert they are named, a strong proof that the list in
      Deuteronomy was written at the end of the journey, and the
      list in Leviticus at the beginning. It fixes the writing of
      that catalogue to one time and period only, viz., that when
      the children of Israel were familiar with the fauna and the
      flora of the desert&quot; (Palest. Expl. Quart., Jan.
      1887). (4.) Laws marking the separation between Israel and
      the heathen (17-20). (5.) Laws about the personal purity of
      the priests, and their eating of the holy things (20; 21);
      about the offerings of Israel, that they were to be without
      blemish (22:17-33); and about the due celebration of the
      great festivals (23; 25). (6.) Then follow promises and
      warnings to the people regarding obedience to these
      commandments, closing with a section on vows.

      The various ordinances contained in this book were all
      delivered in the space of a month (comp. Ex. 40:17; Num.
      1:1), the first month of the second year after the Exodus.
      It is the third book of Moses.

      No book contains more of the very words of God. He is
      almost throughout the whole of it the direct speaker. This
      book is a prophecy of things to come, a shadow whereof the
      substance is Christ and his kingdom. The principles on
      which it is to be interpreted are laid down in the Epistle
      to the Hebrews. It contains in its complicated ceremonial
      the gospel of the grace of God.

      forced service. The service of tributaries was often thus
      exacted by kings. Solomon raised a &quot;great levy&quot;
      of 30,000 men, about two per cent. of the population, to
      work for him by courses on Lebanon. Adoram (12:18) presided

      one who once had been a slave, but who had been set at
      liberty, or the child of such a person. In this case the
      name probably denotes those descendants of Jews who had
      been carried captives to Rome as prisoners of war by Pompey
      and other Roman generals in the Syrian wars, and had
      afterwards been liberated. In A.D. 19 these manumitted Jews
      were banished from Rome. Many of them found their way to

    <p>
      (2.) One of the royal cities of the Canaanites taken by
      Joshua (Josh. 10:29-32; 12:15). It became one of the
      Levitical towns in the tribe of Judah (21:13), and was
      strongly fortified. Sennacherib laid siege to it (2 Kings
      19:8; Isa. 37:8). It was the native place of Hamutal, the
      queen of Josiah (2 Kings 23:31). It stood near Lachish, and
      has been identified with the modern Arak el-Menshiyeh.

      these minute but disgusting insects in the very front rank

      closely allied parasitic pests.&quot; The plague of lice is
      referred to in Ps. 105:31.</a>

    <p>
      Some have supposed that the word denotes not lice properly,

      emotions of the mind, all the pleasing sensations of the
      frame, all the happy hours of domestic intercourse were
      habitually described among the Hebrews under imagery
      derived from light&quot; (1 Kings 11:36; Isa. 58:8; Esther
      8:16; Ps. 97:11). Light came also naturally to typify true
      religion and the felicity it imparts (Ps. 119:105; Isa.
      8:20; Matt. 4:16, etc.), and the glorious inheritance of
      the redeemed (Col. 1:12; Rev. 21:23-25). God is said to
      dwell in light inaccessible (1 Tim. 6:16). It frequently
      signifies instruction (Matt. 5:16; John 5:35). In its
      highest sense it is applied to Christ as the &quot;Sun of
      righteousness&quot; (Mal. 4:2; Luke 2:32; John 1:7-9). God
      is styled &quot;the Father of lights&quot; (James 1:17). It
      is used of angels (2 Cor. 11:14), and of John the Baptist,
      who was a &quot;burning and a shining light&quot; (John
      5:35), and of all true disciples, who are styled &quot;the

      supposed that this stone was the same as the jacinth
      (q.v.), others that it was the opal. There is now no

      named from Liguria in Italy, where it was found.</a>

      <a name="T0002294"><b>Lily -</b> The Hebrew name shushan or
      shoshan, i.e., &quot;whiteness&quot;, was used as the
      general name of several plants common to Syria, such as the
      tulip, iris, anemone, gladiolus, ranunculus, etc. Some
      interpret it, with much probability, as denoting in the Old
      Testament the water-lily (Nymphoea lotus of Linn.), or
      lotus (Cant. 2:1, 2; 2:16; 4:5; 5:13; 6:2, 3; 7:2).
      &quot;Its flowers are large, and they are of a white
      colour, with streaks of pink. They supplied models for the
      ornaments of the pillars and the molten sea&quot; (1 Kings
      7:19, 22, 26; 2 Chr. 4:5). In the Canticles its beauty and
      fragrance shadow forth the preciousness of Christ to the
      Church. Groser, however (Scrip. Nat. Hist.), strongly
      argues that the word, both in the Old and New Testaments,
      denotes liliaceous plants in general, or if one genus is to
      be selected, that it must be the genus Iris, which is
      &quot;large, vigorous, elegant in form, and gorgeous in
      colouring.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lilies (Gr. krinia) spoken of in the New Testament
      (Matt. 6:28; Luke 12:27) were probably the scarlet martagon
      (Lilium Chalcedonicum) or &quot;red Turk&#39;s-cap
      lily&quot;, which &quot;comes into flower at the season of
      the year when our Lord&#39;s sermon on the mount is
      supposed to have been delivered. It is abundant in the
      district of Galilee; and its fine scarlet flowers render it
      a very conspicous and showy object, which would naturally
      attract the attention of the hearers&quot; (Balfour&#39;s
      Plants of the Bible).

    <p>
      Of the true &quot;floral glories of Palestine&quot; the
      pheasant&#39;s eye (Adonis Palestina), the ranunuculus (R.
      Asiaticus), and the anemone (A coronaria), the last named
      is however, with the greatest probability regarded as the
      &quot;lily of the field&quot; to which our Lord refers.
      &quot;Certainly,&quot; says Tristram (Nat. Hist. of the
      Bible), &quot;if, in the wondrous richness of bloom which
      characterizes the land of Israel in spring, any one plant
      can claim pre-eminence, it is the anemone, the most natural
      flower for our Lord to pluck and seize upon as an
      illustration, whether walking in the fields or sitting on
      the hill-side.&quot; &quot;The white water-lily (Nymphcea
      alba) and the yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea) are both
      abundant in the marshes of the Upper Jordan, but have no
      connection with the lily of Scripture.&quot;

      <a name="T0002295"><b>Lime -</b> The Hebrew word so
      rendered means &quot;boiling&quot; or
      &quot;effervescing.&quot; From Isa. 33:12 it appears that
      lime was made in a kiln lighted by thorn-bushes. In Amos
      2:1 it is recorded that the king of Moab &quot;burned the
      bones of the king of Edom into lime.&quot; The same Hebrew
      word is used in Deut. 27:2-4, and is there rendered

      Lev. 13:47, 48, 52, 59; Deut. 22:11.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Flax was early cultivated in Egypt (Ex. 9:31), and also in
      Palestine (Josh. 2:6; Hos. 2:9). Various articles were made
      of it: garments (2 Sam. 6:14), girdles (Jer. 13:1), ropes
      and thread (Ezek. 40:3), napkins (Luke 24:12; John 20:7),

      Lev. 6:10; 16:4, 23, 32; 1 Sam. 2:18; 2 Sam. 6:14, etc. It
      is uniformly used of the sacred vestments worn by the
      priests. The word is from a root signifying
      &quot;separation.&quot;

    <p>
      (4.) Heb. shesh; rendered &quot;fine linen&quot; Ex. 25:4;
      26:1, 31, 36, etc. In Prov. 31:22 it is rendered in
      Authorized Version &quot;silk,&quot; and in Revised Version
      &quot;fine linen.&quot; The word denotes Egyptian linen of
      peculiar whiteness and fineness (byssus). The finest Indian
      linen, the finest now made, has in an inch one hundred
      threads of warp and eighty-four of woof; while the Egyptian
      had sometimes one hundred and forty in the warp and
      sixty-four in the woof. This was the usual dress of the
      Egyptian priest. Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in a dress of linen
      (Gen. 41:42).

    <p>
      (5.) Heb. &#39;etun. Prov. 7:16, &quot;fine linen of

      Egypt.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) Heb. sadin. Prov. 31:24, &quot;fine linen;&quot; in
      Revised Version, &quot;linen garments&quot; (Judg. 14:12,
      13; Isa. 3:23). From this Hebrew word is probably derived
      the Greek word sindon, rendered &quot;linen&quot; in Mark
      14:51, 52; 15:46; Matt. 27:59.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &quot;linen&quot; is used as an emblem of moral
