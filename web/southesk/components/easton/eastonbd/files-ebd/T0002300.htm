      <a name="T0002300"><b>Lions -</b> the most powerful of all
      carnivorous animals. Although not now found in Palestine,
      they must have been in ancient times very numerous there.
      They had their lairs in the forests (Jer. 5:6; 12:8; Amos
      3:4), in the caves of the mountains (Cant. 4:8; Nah. 2:12),
      and in the canebrakes on the banks of the Jordan (Jer.
      49:19; 50:44; Zech. 11:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      No fewer than at least six different words are used in the
      Old Testament for the lion. (1.) <i>Gor</i> (i.e., a
      &quot;suckling&quot;), the lion&#39;s whelp (Gen. 49:9;
      Jer. 51:38, etc.). (2.) <i>Kephir</i> (i.e.,
      &quot;shaggy&quot;), the young lion (Judg. 14:5; Job 4:10;
      Ps. 91:13; 104:21), a term which is also used figuratively
      of cruel enemies (Ps. 34:10; 35:17; 58:6; Jer. 2:15). (3.)
      <i>&#39;Ari</i> (i.e., the &quot;puller&quot; in pieces),
      denoting the lion in general, without reference to age or
      sex (Num. 23:24; 2 Sam. 17:10, etc.). (4.) <i>Shahal</i>
      (the &quot;roarer&quot;), the mature lion (Job 4:10; Ps.
      91:13; Prov. 26:13; Hos. 5:14). (5.) <i>Laish</i>, so
      called from its strength and bravery (Job 4:11; Prov.
      30:30; Isa. 30:6). The capital of Northern Dan received its
      name from this word. (6.) <i>Labi</i>, from a root meaning
      &quot;to roar,&quot; a grown lion or lioness (Gen. 49:9;
      Num. 23:24; 24:9; Ezek. 19:2; Nah. 2:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion of Palestine was properly of the Asiatic variety,
      distinguished from the African variety, which is larger.
      Yet it not only attacked flocks in the presence of the
      shepherd, but also laid waste towns and villages (2 Kings
      17:25, 26) and devoured men (1 Kings 13:24, 25). Shepherds
      sometimes, single-handed, encountered lions and slew them
      (1 Sam. 17:34, 35; Amos 3:12). Samson seized a young lion
      with his hands and &quot;rent him as he would have rent a
      kid&quot; (Judg. 14:5, 6). The strength (Judg. 14:18),
      courage (2 Sam. 17:10), and ferocity (Gen. 49:9) of the
      lion were proverbial.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002301"><b>Lip -</b> besides its literal sense
      (Isa. 37:29, etc.), is used in the original (saphah)
      metaphorically for an edge or border, as of a cup (1 Kings
      7:26), a garment (Ex. 28:32), a curtain (26:4), the sea
      (Gen. 22:17), the Jordan (2 Kings 2:13). To &quot;open the
      lips&quot; is to begin to speak (Job 11:5); to
      &quot;refrain the lips&quot; is to keep silence (Ps. 40:9;
      1 Pet. 3:10). The &quot;fruit of the lips&quot; (Heb.
      13:15) is praise, and the &quot;calves of the lips&quot;
      thank-offerings (Hos. 14:2). To &quot;shoot out the
      lip&quot; is to manifest scorn and defiance (Ps. 22:7).
      Many similar forms of expression are found in
      Scripture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002302"><b>Litter -</b> (Heb. tsab, as being
      lightly and gently borne), a sedan or palanquin for the
      conveyance of persons of rank (Isa. 66:20). In Num. 7:3,
      the words &quot;covered wagons&quot; are more literally
      &quot;carts of the litter kind.&quot; There they denote
      large and commodious vehicles drawn by oxen, and fitted for
      transporting the furniture of the temple.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002303"><b>Liver -</b> (Heb. kabhed,
      &quot;heavy;&quot; hence the liver, as being the heaviest
      of the viscera, Ex. 29:13, 22; Lev. 3:4, 1, 10, 15) was
      burnt upon the altar, and not used as sacrificial food. In
      Ezek. 21:21 there is allusion, in the statement that the
      king of Babylon &quot;looked upon the liver,&quot; to one
      of the most ancient of all modes of divination. The first
      recorded instance of divination (q.v.) is that of the
      teraphim of Laban. By the teraphim the LXX. and Josephus
      understood &quot;the liver of goats.&quot; By the
      &quot;caul above the liver,&quot; in Lev. 4:9; 7:4, etc.,
      some understand the great lobe of the liver itself.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002304"><b>Living creatures -</b> as represented
      by Ezekiel (1-10) and John (Rev. 4, etc.), are the
      cherubim. They are distinguished from angels (Rev. 15:7);
      they join the elders in the &quot;new song&quot; (5:8, 9);
      they warn of danger from divine justice (Isa. 6:3-5), and
      deliver the commission to those who execute it (Ezek. 10:2,
      7); they associate with the elders in their sympathy with
      the hundred and forty-four thousand who sing the new song
      (Rev. 14:3), and with the Church in the overthrow of her
      enemies (19:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are supposed to represent mercy, as distinguished from
      justice, mercy in its various instrumentalities, and
      especially as connected with the throne of God, the
      &quot;throne of grace.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002305"><b>Lizard -</b> Only in Lev. 11:30, as
      rendering of Hebrew <i>letaah</i>, so called from its
      &quot;hiding.&quot; Supposed to be the Lacerta gecko or
      fan-foot lizard, from the toes of which poison exudes. (See
      <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000700.html&amp;from=T0000764&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      CHAMELEON</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002306"><b>Lo-ammi -</b> not my people, a
      symbolical name given by God&#39;s command to Hosea&#39;s
      second son in token of Jehovah&#39;s rejection of his
      people (Hos. 1:9, 10), his treatment of them as a foreign
      people. This Hebrew word is rendered by &quot;not my
      people&quot; in ver. 10; 2:23.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002307"><b>Loan -</b> The Mosaic law required
      that when an Israelite needed to borrow, what he asked was
      to be freely lent to him, and no interest was to be
      charged, although interest might be taken of a foreigner
      (Ex. 22:25; Deut. 23:19, 20; Lev. 25:35-38). At the end of
      seven years all debts were remitted. Of a foreigner the
      loan might, however, be exacted. At a later period of the
      Hebrew commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice
      of exacting usury or interest on loans, and of suretiship
      in the commercial sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it
      from a Hebrew was regarded as discreditable (Ps. 15:5;
      Prov. 6:1, 4; 11:15; 17:18; 20:16; 27:13; Jer. 15:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Limitations are prescribed by the law to the taking of a
      pledge from the borrower. The outer garment in which a man
      slept at night, if taken in pledge, was to be returned
      before sunset (Ex. 22:26, 27; Deut. 24:12, 13). A
      widow&#39;s garment (Deut. 24:17) and a millstone (6) could
      not be taken. A creditor could not enter the house to
      reclaim a pledge, but must remain outside till the borrower
      brought it (10, 11). The Hebrew debtor could not be
      retained in bondage longer than the seventh year, or at
      farthest the year of jubilee (Ex. 21:2; Lev. 25:39, 42),
      but foreign sojourners were to be &quot;bondmen for
      ever&quot; (Lev. 25:44-54).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002308"><b>Lock -</b> The Hebrews usually
      secured their doors by bars of wood or iron (Isa. 45:2; 1
      Kings 4:3). These were the locks originally used, and were
      opened and shut by large keys applied through an opening in
      the outside (Judg. 3:24). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002100.html&amp;from=T0002181&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">

    <p>
      Lock of hair (Judg. 16:13, 19; Ezek. 8:3; Num. 6:5, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002309"><b>Locust -</b> There are ten Hebrew
      words used in Scripture to signify locust. In the New
      Testament locusts are mentioned as forming part of the food
      of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6). By the Mosaic
      law they were reckoned &quot;clean,&quot; so that he could
      lawfully eat them. The name also occurs in Rev. 9:3, 7, in
      allusion to this Oriental devastating insect.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Locusts belong to the class of Orthoptera, i.e.,
      straight-winged. They are of many species. The ordinary
      Syrian locust resembles the grasshopper, but is larger and
      more destructive. &quot;The legs and thighs of these
      insects are so powerful that they can leap to a height of
      two hundred times the length of their bodies. When so
      raised they spread their wings and fly so close together as
      to appear like one compact moving mass.&quot; Locusts are
      prepared as food in various ways. Sometimes they are
      pounded, and then mixed with flour and water, and baked
      into cakes; &quot;sometimes boiled, roasted, or stewed in
      butter, and then eaten.&quot; They were eaten in a
      preserved state by the ancient Assyrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devastations they make in Eastern lands are often very
      appalling. The invasions of locusts are the heaviest
      calamites that can befall a country. &quot;Their numbers
      exceed computation: the hebrews called them &#39;the
      countless,&#39; and the Arabs knew them as &#39;the
      darkeners of the sun.&#39; Unable to guide their own
      flight, though capable of crossing large spaces, they are
      at the mercy of the wind, which bears them as blind
      instruments of Providence to the doomed region given over
      to them for the time. Innumerable as the drops of water or
      the sands of the seashore, their flight obscures the sun
      and casts a thick shadow on the earth (Ex. 10:15; Judg.
      6:5; 7:12; Jer. 46:23; Joel 2:10). It seems indeed as if a
      great aerial mountain, many miles in breadth, were
      advancing with a slow, unresting progress. Woe to the
      countries beneath them if the wind fall and let them
      alight! They descend unnumbered as flakes of snow and hide
      the ground. It may be &#39;like the garden of Eden before
      them, but behind them is a desolate wilderness. At their
      approach the people are in anguish; all faces lose their
      colour&#39; (Joel 2:6). No walls can stop them; no ditches
      arrest them; fires kindled in their path are forthwith
      extinguished by the myriads of their dead, and the
      countless armies march on (Joel 2:8, 9). If a door or a
      window be open, they enter and destroy everything of wood
      in the house. Every terrace, court, and inner chamber is
      filled with them in a moment. Such an awful visitation
      swept over Egypt (Ex. 10:1-19), consuming before it every
      green thing, and stripping the trees, till the land was
      bared of all signs of vegetation. A strong north-west wind
      from the Mediterranean swept the locusts into the Red
      Sea.&quot;, Geikie&#39;s Hours, etc., ii., 149.

      <a name="T0002310"><b>Lo-debar -</b> no pasture, (2 Sam.
      17:27), a town in Gilead not far from Mahanaim, north of
      the Jabbok (9:4, 5). It is probably identical with Debir
      (Josh. 13:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002311"><b>Lodge -</b> a shed for a watchman in
      a garden (Isa. 1:8). The Hebrew name <i>melunah</i> is
      rendered &quot;cottage&quot; (q.v.) in Isa. 24:20. It also
      denotes a hammock or hanging-bed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002312"><b>Log -</b> the smallest measure for
      liquids used by the Hebrews (Lev. 14:10, 12, 15, 21, 24),
      called in the Vulgate sextarius. It is the Hebrew unit of
      measure of capacity, and is equal to the contents of six
      ordinary hen&#39;s eggs=the twelfth part of a him, or
      nearly a pint.</a>

      of cord, corresponding to the &quot;taches&quot; or knobs
      in the edges of the curtains of the tabernacle, for joining
      them into a continuous circuit, fifty to a curtain (Ex.
      26:4, 5, 10, 11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002315"><b>Lord -</b> There are various Hebrew
      and Greek words so rendered.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Heb. Jehovah, has been rendered in the English Bible
      LORD, printed in small capitals. This is the proper name of
      the God of the Hebrews. The form &quot;Jehovah&quot; is
      retained only in Ex. 6:3; Ps. 83:18; Isa. 12:2; 26:4, both
      in the Authorized and the Revised Version.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. &#39;adon, means one possessed of absolute
      control. It denotes a master, as of slaves (Gen. 24:14,
      27), or a ruler of his subjects (45:8), or a husband, as
      lord of his wife (18:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The old plural form of this Hebrew word is <i>
      &#39;adonai</i>. From a superstitious reverence for the
      name &quot;Jehovah,&quot; the Jews, in reading their
      Scriptures, whenever that name occurred, always pronounced
      it <i>&#39;Adonai</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Greek kurios, a supreme master, etc. In the LXX. this
      is invariably used for &quot;Jehovah&quot; and
      &quot;&#39;Adonai.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. ba&#39;al, a master, as having domination. This
      word is applied to human relations, as that of husband, to
      persons skilled in some art or profession, and to heathen
      deities. &quot;The men of Shechem,&quot; literally
      &quot;the baals of Shechem&quot; (Judg. 9:2, 3). These were
      the Israelite inhabitants who had reduced the Canaanites to
      a condition of vassalage (Josh. 16:10; 17:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Heb. seren, applied exclusively to the &quot;lords of
      the Philistines&quot; (Judg. 3:3). The LXX. render it by
      satrapies. At this period the Philistines were not, as at a
      later period (1 Sam. 21:10), under a kingly government.
      (See Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 6:18.) There were five such
      lordships, viz., Gath, Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron.

      <a name="T0002316"><b>Lord&#39;s day -</b> only once, in
      Rev. 1:10, was in the early Christian ages used to denote
      the first day of the week, which commemorated the
      Lord&#39;s resurrection. There is every reason to conclude
      that John thus used the name. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003100.html&amp;from=T0003170&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002317"><b>Lord&#39;s Prayer -</b> the name
      given to the only form of prayer Christ taught his
      disciples (Matt. 6:9-13). The closing doxology of the
      prayer is omitted by Luke (11:2-4), also in the R.V. of
      Matt. 6:13. This prayer contains no allusion to the
      atonement of Christ, nor to the offices of the Holy Spirit.
      &quot;All Christian prayer is based on the Lord&#39;s
      Prayer, but its spirit is also guided by that of His prayer
      in Gethsemane and of the prayer recorded John 17. The
      Lord&#39;s Prayer is the comprehensive type of the simplest
      and most universal prayer.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002318"><b>Lord&#39;s Supper -</b> (1 Cor.
      11:20), called also &quot;the Lord&#39;s table&quot;
      (10:21), &quot;communion,&quot; &quot;cup of blessing&quot;
      (10:16), and &quot;breaking of bread&quot; (Acts 2:42).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early Church it was called also
      &quot;eucharist,&quot; or giving of thanks (comp. Matt.
      26:27), and generally by the Latin Church &quot;mass,&quot;
      a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa
      est, i.e., &quot;Go, it is discharged.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The account of the institution of this ordinance is given
      in Matt. 26:26-29, Mark 14:22-25, Luke 22:19, 20, and 1
      Cor. 11:24-26. It is not mentioned by John.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was designed, (1.) To commemorate the death of Christ:
      &quot;This do in remembrance of me.&quot; (2.) To signify,
      seal, and apply to believers all the benefits of the new
      covenant. In this ordinance Christ ratifies his promises to
      his people, and they on their part solemnly consecrate
      themselves to him and to his entire service. (3.) To be a
      badge of the Christian profession. (4.) To indicate and to

      The elements used to represent Christ&#39;s body and blood
      are bread and wine. The kind of bread, whether leavened or
      unleavened, is not specified. Christ used unleavened bread
      simply because it was at that moment on the paschal table.
      Wine, and no other liquid, is to be used (Matt. 26:26-29).
      Believers &quot;feed&quot; on Christ&#39;s body and blood,
      (1) not with the mouth in any manner, but (2) by the soul
      alone, and (3) by faith, which is the mouth or hand of the
      soul. This they do (4) by the power of the Holy Ghost. This
      &quot;feeding&quot; on Christ, however, takes place not in
      the Lord&#39;s Supper alone, but whenever faith in him is
      exercised.

      (Num. 33:54; Jonah 1:7). The lot was always resorted to by
      the Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition
      of God, and as a method of ascertaining the divine will
      (Prov. 16:33), and in serious cases of doubt (Esther 3:7).
      Thus the lot was used at the division of the land of Canaan
      among the serveral tribes (Num. 26:55; 34:13), at the
      detection of Achan (Josh. 7:14, 18), the election of Saul

      Lot, (Heb. lot), a covering; veil, the son of Haran, and
      nephew of Abraham (Gen. 11:27). On the death of his father,
      he was left in charge of his grandfather Terah (31), after
      whose death he accompanied his uncle Abraham into Canaan
      (12:5), thence into Egypt (10), and back again to Canaan
      (13:1). After this he separated from him and settled in
      Sodom (13:5-13). There his righteous soul was
      &quot;vexed&quot; from day to day (2 Pet. 2:7), and he had
      great cause to regret this act. Not many years after the
      separation he was taken captive by Chedorlaomer, and was
      rescued by Abraham (Gen. 14). At length, when the judgment
      of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain (Gen.
      19:1-20), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from
      the doomed city his wife &quot;looked back from behind him,
      and became a pillar of salt.&quot; There is to this day a
      peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead Sea, near
      Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e.,
      Lot&#39;s wife. It is &quot;a tall, isolated needle of
      rock, which really does bear a curious resemblance to an
      Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder.&quot; From the
      words of warning in Luke 17:32, &quot;Remember Lot&#39;s
      wife,&quot; it would seem as if she had gone back, or
      tarried so long behind in the desire to save some of her
      goods, that she became involved in the destruction which
      fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed for
      a time in the saline incrustations. She became &quot;a
      pillar of salt&quot;, i.e., as some think, of asphalt. (See

      Lot and his daughters sought refuge first in Zoar, and
      then, fearing to remain there longer, retired to a cave in
      the neighbouring mountains (Gen. 19:30). Lot has recently
      been connected with the people called on the Egyptian
      monuments Rotanu or Lotanu, who is supposed to have been
      the hero of the Edomite tribe Lotan.

      explanation only in the case of its use by our Lord in his
      interview with &quot;Simon, the son of Jonas,&quot; after
      his resurrection (John 21:16, 17). When our Lord says,
      &quot;Lovest thou me?&quot; he uses the Greek word <i>
      agapas</i>; and when Simon answers, he uses the Greek word
      <i>philo</i>, i.e., &quot;I love.&quot; This is the usage
      in the first and second questions put by our Lord; but in
      the third our Lord uses Simon&#39;s word. The distinction
      between these two Greek words is thus fitly described by
      Trench:, &quot;<i>Agapan</i> has more of judgment and
      deliberate choice; <i>philein</i> has more of attachment
      and peculiar personal affection. Thus the &#39;Lovest
      thou&#39; (Gr. agapas) on the lips of the Lord seems to
      Peter at this moment too cold a word, as though his Lord
      were keeping him at a distance, or at least not inviting
      him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of his
      heart he desired now to do. Therefore he puts by the word
      and substitutes his own stronger &#39;I love&#39; (Gr.
      philo) in its room. A second time he does the same. And now
      he has conquered; for when the Lord demands a third time
      whether he loves him, he does it in the word which alone
      will satisfy Peter (&#39;Lovest thou,&#39; Gr. phileis),
      which alone claims from him that personal attachment and
      affection with which indeed he knows that his heart is
      full.&quot;</a>

      not an &quot;eye-witness and minister of the word from the
      beginning.&quot; It is probable that he was a physician in
      Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he attached
      himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there
      share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further
      after his release in his missionary journey at this time
      (Acts 17:1). On Paul&#39;s third visit to Philippi (20:5,
      6) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the
      intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight
      years. From this time Luke was Paul&#39;s constant
      companion during his journey to Jerusalem (20:6-21:18). He
      again disappears from view during Paul&#39;s imprisonment
      at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul
      sets out for Rome (27:1), whither he accompanies him (28:2,
      12-16), and where he remains with him till the close of his
      first imprisonment (Philemon 1:24; Col. 4:14). The last
      notice of the &quot;beloved physician&quot; is in 2 Tim.

      the best sources of information within his reach, and to
      have written an orderly narrative of the facts (Luke
      1:1-4). The authors of the first three Gospels, the
      synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote
      his independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy
      Spirit.</a>

    <p>
      Each writer has some things, both in matter and style,
      peculiar to himself, yet all the three have much in common.
      Luke&#39;s Gospel has been called &quot;the Gospel of the
      nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by
      the love of a suffering Saviour;&quot; &quot;the Gospel of
      the saintly life;&quot; &quot;the Gospel for the Greeks;
      the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive
      Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the
      gospel; the historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the
      good Physician and the Saviour of mankind;&quot; the
      &quot;Gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood
      of man;&quot; &quot;the Gospel of womanhood;&quot;
      &quot;the Gospel of the outcast, of the Samaritan, the
      publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;&quot; &quot;the
      Gospel of tolerance.&quot; The main characteristic of this
      Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks,
      is fitly expressed in the motto, &quot;Who went about doing
      good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
      devil&quot; (Acts 10:38; comp. Luke 4:18). Luke wrote for
      the &quot;Hellenic world.&quot; This Gospel is indeed
      &quot;rich and precious.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Out of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common
      with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41
      in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself.
      In many instances all three use identical language.&quot;

    </p>
    <p>
      There are seventeen of our Lord&#39;s parables peculiar to
      this Gospel. (See List of Parables in Appendix.) Luke also
      records seven of our Lord&#39;s miracles which are omitted
      by Matthew and Mark. (See List of Miracles in Appendix.)
      The synoptical Gospels are related to each other after the
      following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel be
      represented by 100, then when compared this result is
      obtained:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark has 7 peculiarities, 93 coincidences. Matthew 42
      peculiarities, 58 coincidences. Luke 59 peculiarities, 41
      coincidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of
      Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing
      the same things in very similar language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke&#39;s style is more finished and classical than that
      of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the Hebrew
      idiom. He uses a few Latin words (Luke 12:6; 7:41; 8:30;
      11:33; 19:20), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except sikera,
      an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of
      grapes (from Heb. shakar, &quot;he is intoxicated&quot;,
      Lev. 10:9), probably palm wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Gospel contains twenty-eight distinct references to
      the Old Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date of its composition is uncertain. It must have been
      written before the Acts, the date of the composition of
      which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64 A.D. This Gospel
      was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63, when Luke
      may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was
      then a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was
      written at Rome during Paul&#39;s imprisonment there. But
      on this point no positive certainty can be attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the
      direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and
      phrases are common to both; e.g., compare:

      his superior officer is an interesting specimen of Roman

      Here Paul preached the gospel after he had been driven by
      persecution from Iconium (Acts 14:2-7). Here also he healed
      a lame man (8), and thus so impressed the ignorant and
      superstitious people that they took him for Mercury,
      because he was the &quot;chief speaker,&quot; and his
      companion Barnabas for Jupiter, probably in consequence of
      his stately, venerable appearance; and were proceeding to
      offer sacrifices to them (13), when Paul earnestly
      addressed them and turned their attention to the true
      source of all blessings. But soon after, through the
      influence of the Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium,
      they stoned Paul and left him for dead (14:19). On
      recovering, Paul left for Derbe; but soon returned again,
      through Lystra, encouraging the disciples there to
      steadfastness. He in all likelihood visited this city again
      on his third missionary tour (Acts 18:23). Timothy, who was
      probably born here (2 Tim. 3:10, 11), was no doubt one of
      those who were on this occasion witnesses of Paul&#39;s
      persecution and his courage in Lystra.</a>

      occur in Scripture. It was the name given to the leaders of
      the national party among the Jews who suffered in the
      persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes, who succeeded to the
      Syrian throne B.C. 175. It is supposed to have been derived
      from the Hebrew word (makkabah) meaning &quot;hammer,&quot;
      as suggestive of the heroism and power of this Jewish
      family, who are, however, more properly called Asmoneans or
      Hasmonaeans, the origin of which is much disputed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the expulsion of Antiochus Epiphanes from Egypt by
      the Romans, he gave vent to his indignation on the Jews,
      great numbers of whom he mercilessly put to death in
      Jerusalem. He oppressed them in every way, and tried to
      abolish altogether the Jewish worship. Mattathias, an aged
      priest, then residing at Modin, a city to the west of
      Jerusalem, became now the courageous leader of the national
      party; and having fled to the mountains, rallied round him
      a large band of men prepared to fight and die for their
      country and for their religion, which was now violently
      suppressed. In 1 Macc. 2:60 is recorded his dying counsels
      to his sons with reference to the war they were now to
      carry on. His son Judas, &quot;the Maccabee,&quot;
      succeeded him (B.C. 166) as the leader in directing the war
      of independence, which was carried on with great heroism on
      the part of the Jews, and was terminated in the defeat of
      the Syrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002351"><b>Maccabees, Books of the -</b> There
      were originally five books of the Maccabees. The first
      contains a history of the war of independence, commencing
      (B.C. 175) in a series of patriotic struggles against the
      tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and terminating B.C. 135.
      It became part of the Vulgate Version of the Bible, and was
      thus retained among the Apocrypha.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second gives a history of the Maccabees&#39; struggle
      from B.C. 176 to B.C. 161. Its object is to encourage and
      admonish the Jews to be faithful to the religion of their
      fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third does not hold a place in the Apocrypha, but is
      read in the Greek Church. Its design is to comfort the
      Alexandrian Jews in their persecution. Its writer was
      evidently an Alexandrian Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth was found in the Library of Lyons, but was
      afterwards burned. The fifth contains a history of the Jews
      from B.C. 184 to B.C. 86. It is a compilation made by a Jew
      after the destruction of Jerusalem, from ancient memoirs,
      to which he had access. It need scarcely be added that none
      of these books has any divine authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002352"><b>Macedonia -</b> in New Testament
      times, was a Roman province lying north of Greece. It was
      governed by a propraetor with the title of proconsul. Paul
      was summoned by the vision of the &quot;man of
      Macedonia&quot; to preach the gospel there (Acts 16:9).
      Frequent allusion is made to this event (18:5; 19:21; Rom.
      15:26; 2 Cor. 1:16; 11:9; Phil. 4:15). The history of
      Paul&#39;s first journey through Macedonia is given in
      detail in Acts 16:10-17:15. At the close of this journey he
      returned from Corinth to Syria. He again passed through
      this country (20:1-6), although the details of the route
      are not given. After many years he probably visited it for
      a third time (Phil. 2:24; 1 Tim. 1:3). The first convert
      made by Paul in Europe was (Acts 16:13-15) Lydia (q.v.), a
      &quot;seller of purple,&quot; residing in Philippi, the
      chief city of the eastern division of Macedonia.</a>

      <a name="T0002353"><b>Machaerus -</b> the Black Fortress,
      was built by Herod the Great in the gorge of Callirhoe, one
      of the wadies 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, as a frontier
      rampart against Arab marauders. John the Baptist was
      probably cast into the prison connected with this castle by
      Herod Antipas, whom he had reproved for his adulterous
      marriage with Herodias. Here Herod &quot;made a
      supper&quot; on his birthday. He was at this time marching
      against Aretas, king of Perea, to whose daughter he had
      been married. During the revelry of the banquet held in the
      border fortress, to please Salome, who danced before him,
      he sent an executioner, who beheaded John, and
      &quot;brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the
      damsel&quot; (Mark 6:14-29). This castle stood
      &quot;starkly bold and clear&quot; 3,860 feet above the
      Dead Sea, and 2,546 above the Mediterranean. Its ruins, now
      called M&#39;khaur, are still visible on the northern end
      of Jebel Attarus.</a>

      only son (see 1 Chr. 7:14, 15; comp. Num. 26:29-33; Josh.
      13:31). His descendants are referred to under the name of
      Machirites, being the offspring of Gilead (Num. 26:29).
      They settled in land taken from the Amorites (Num. 32:39,
      40; Deut. 3:15) by a special enactment (Num. 36:1-3; Josh.
      17:3, 4). He is once mentioned as the representative of the
      tribe of Manasseh east of Jordan (Judg. 5:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A descendant of the preceding, residing at Lo-debar,
      where he maintained Jonathan&#39;s son Mephibosheth till he

      he afterwards gave shelter to David himself when he was a
      fugitive (17:27).

      <a name="T0002356"><b>Machpelah -</b> portion; double cave,
      the cave which Abraham bought, together with the field in
      which it stood, from Ephron the Hittite, for a family
      burying-place (Gen. 23). It is one of those Bible
      localities about the identification of which there can be
      no doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of
      Hebron, &quot;before Mamre.&quot; Here were laid the bodies
      of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah
      (Gen. 23:19; 25:9; 49:31; 50:13). Over the cave an ancient
      Christian church was erected, probably in the time of
      Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been
      converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded
      by the el-Haram i.e., &quot;the sacred enclosure,&quot;
      about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of
      about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of
      its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted
      together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the
      days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the
      time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and
      finest relic of Jewish architecture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs
      as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave
      beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there
      is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below,
      the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of
      Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved
      (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the
      cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt, see PHARAOH
      &macr;T0002923), though those of the others there buried
      may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the
      mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a
      special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An
      interesting account of this visit is given in Dean
      Stanley&#39;s Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also
      visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the
      late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince
      of Prussia. In 1881 it was visited by the two sons of the
      Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C. Wilson and others.

      Tiberias, and is now probably the small obscure village

      the Talmud this city is called &quot;the city of

      Marys (Matt. 27:56, 61; 28:1, etc.). A mistaken notion has
      prevailed that this Mary was a woman of bad character, that
      she was the woman who is emphatically called &quot;a

      <a name="T0002365"><b>Magic -</b> The Jews seem early to
      have consulted the teraphim (q.v.) for oracular answers
      (Judg. 18:5, 6; Zech. 10:2). There is a remarkable
      illustration of this divining by teraphim in Ezek.
      21:19-22. We read also of the divining cup of Joseph (Gen.
      44:5). The magicians of Egypt are frequently referred to in
      the history of the Exodus. Magic was an inherent part of
      the ancient Egyptian religion, and entered largely into
      their daily life.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      All magical arts were distinctly prohibited under penalty
      of death in the Mosaic law. The Jews were commanded not to
      learn the &quot;abomination&quot; of the people of the
      Promised Land (Lev. 19:31; Deut. 18:9-14). The history of
      Saul&#39;s consulting the witch of Endor (1 Sam. 28:3-20)
      gives no warrant for attributing supernatural power to
      magicians. From the first the witch is here only a
      bystander. The practice of magic lingered among the people
      till after the Captivity, when they gradually abandoned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not much referred to in the New Testament. The Magi
      mentioned in Matt. 2:1-12 were not magicians in the
      ordinary sense of the word. They belonged to a religious
      caste, the followers of Zoroaster, the astrologers of the
      East. Simon, a magician, was found by Philip at Samaria
      (Acts 8:9-24); and Paul and Barnabas encountered Elymas, a
      Jewish sorcerer, at Paphos (13:6-12). At Ephesus there was
      a great destruction of magical books (Acts 19:18, 19).

      (Deut. 1:16, 17). In Judg. 18:7 the word
      &quot;magistrate&quot; (A.V.) is rendered in the Revised
      Version &quot;possessing authority&quot;, i.e., having
      power to do them harm by invasion. In the time of Ezra
      (9:2) and Nehemiah (2:16; 4:14; 13:11) the Jewish
      magistrates were called <i>seganim</i>, properly meaning
      &quot;nobles.&quot; In the New Testament the Greek word <i>
      archon</i>, rendered &quot;magistrate&quot; (Luke 12:58;
      Titus 3:1), means one first in power, and hence a prince,
      as in Matt. 20:25, 1 Cor. 2:6, 8. This term is used of the
      Messiah, &quot;Prince of the kings of the earth&quot; (Rev.
      1:5). In Acts 16:20, 22, 35, 36, 38, the Greek term <i>
      strategos</i>, rendered &quot;magistrate,&quot; properly
      signifies the leader of an army, a general, one having
      military authority. The <i>strategoi</i> were the duumviri,
      the two praetors appointed to preside over the
      administration of justice in the colonies of the Romans.
      They were attended by the sergeants (properly lictors or
      &quot;rod bearers&quot;).</a>

      In Ezekiel (38:2; 39:6) it is the name of a nation,
      probably some Scythian or Tartar tribe descended from
      Japheth. They are described as skilled horsemen, and expert
      in the use of the bow. The Latin father Jerome says that
      this word denotes &quot;Scythian nations, fierce and
      innumerable, who live beyond the Caucasus and the Lake
      Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, and spread out even
      onward to India.&quot; Perhaps the name &quot;represents
      the Assyrian Mat Gugi, or &#39;country of Gugu,&#39; the

      sung to the accompaniment of the lute or guitar. Others
      regard this word &quot;mahalath&quot; as the name simply of
      an old air to which the psalm was to be sung. Others,

      near the Jabbok, beyond Jordan, where Jacob was met by the
      &quot;angels of God,&quot; and where he divided his retinue
      into &quot;two hosts&quot; on his return from Padan-aram
      (Gen. 32:2). This name was afterwards given to the town
      which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary
      of Bashan (Josh. 13:26, 30), and became a city of the
      Levites (21:38). Here Saul&#39;s son Ishbosheth reigned (2
      Sam. 2:8, 12), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also,
      after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of
      his own bodyguard (2 Sam. 4:5-7), who brought his head to
      David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put
      to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years
      after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of
      his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai
      entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his
      forces which were led against the army that had gathered
      around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this
      town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between
      the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached
      him, when he gave way to the most violent grief (2 Sam.
      17:24-27).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other reference to Mahanaim is as a station of one
      of Solomon&#39;s purveyors (1 Kings 4:14). It has been
      identified with the modern Mukhumah, a ruin found in a
      depressed plain called el-Bukie&#39;a, &quot;the little
      vale,&quot; near Penuel, south of the Jabbok, and

      Kirjath-jearim, where the six hundred Danites from Zorah
      and Eshtaol encamped on their way to capture the city of
      Laish, which they rebuilt and called &quot;Dan, after the
      name of their father&quot; (18:11-31). The Palestine

      confederated against Israel sought refuge (10:10-29). They
      were put to death by Joshua, who afterwards suspended their

      modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill about
      7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin),
      where are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine
      Exploration surveyors have, however, identified it with
      el-Mughar, or &quot;the caves,&quot; 3 miles from Jabneh
      and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, &quot;at

      <a name="T0002387"><b>Malachi -</b> messenger or angel, the
      last of the minor prophets, and the writer of the last book
      of the Old Testament canon (Mal. 4:4, 5, 6). Nothing is
      known of him beyond what is contained in his book of
      prophecies. Some have supposed that the name is simply a
      title descriptive of his character as a messenger of
      Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is reason, however,
      to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the
      prophet.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was contemporary with Nehemiah (comp. Mal. 2:8 with Neh.
      13:15; Mal. 2:10-16 with Neh. 13:23). No allusion is made
      to him by Ezra, and he does not mention the restoration of
      the temple, and hence it is inferred that he prophesied
      after Haggai and Zechariah, and when the temple services
      were still in existence (Mal. 1:10; 3:1, 10). It is
      probable that he delivered his prophecies about B.C. 420,
      after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia (Neh.
      13:6), or possibly before his return.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002388"><b>Malachi, Prophecies of -</b> The
      contents of the book are comprised in four chapters. In the
      Hebrew text the third and fourth chapters (of the A.V.)
      form but one. The whole consists of three sections,
      preceded by an introduction (Mal. 1:1-5), in which the
      prophet reminds Israel of Jehovah&#39;s love to them. The
      first section (1:6-2:9) contains a stern rebuke addressed
      to the priests who had despised the name of Jehovah, and
      been leaders in a departure from his worship and from the
      covenant, and for their partiality in administering the
      law. In the second (2:9-16) the people are rebuked for
      their intermarriages with idolatrous heathen. In the third
      (2:17-4:6) he addresses the people as a whole, and warns
      them of the coming of the God of judgment, preceded by the
      advent of the Messiah.</a>

      taken by David, the crown of this idol was among the
      spoils. The weight is said to have been &quot;a talent of
      gold&quot; (above 100 lbs.). The expression probably

      &quot;the oaks [marg., &#39;terebinths&#39;] of

      <a name="T0002398"><b>Man -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;Adam, used
      as the proper name of the first man. The name is derived
      from a word meaning &quot;to be red,&quot; and thus the
      first man was called Adam because he was formed from the
      red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race
      (Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:2; 8:21; Deut. 8:3). Its equivalents are
      the Latin homo and the Greek anthropos (Matt. 5:13, 16). It
      denotes also man in opposition to woman (Gen. 3:12; Matt.

      with reference to excellent mental qualities.

    <p>
      (3.) Heb. &#39;enosh, man as mortal, transient, perishable
      (2 Chr. 14:11; Isa. 8:1; Job 15:14; Ps. 8:4; 9:19, 20;

      (4.) Heb. geber, man with reference to his strength, as
      distinguished from women (Deut. 22:5) and from children
      (Ex. 12:37); a husband (Prov. 6:34).

    <p>
      Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is
      generically different from all other creatures (Gen. 1:26,
      27; 2:7). His complex nature is composed of two elements,
      two distinct substances, viz., body and soul (Gen. 2:7;
      Eccl. 12:7; 2 Cor. 5:1-8).
    </p>
    <p>
      The words translated &quot;spirit&quot; and
      &quot;soul,&quot; in 1 Thess. 5:23, Heb. 4:12, are
      habitually used interchangeably (Matt. 10:28; 16:26; 1 Pet.
      1:22). The &quot;spirit&quot; (Gr. pneuma) is the soul as
      rational; the &quot;soul&quot; (Gr. psuche) is the same,
      considered as the animating and vital principle of the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection
      of his nature, in knowledge (Col. 3:10), righteousness, and
      holiness (Eph. 4:24), and as having dominion over all the
