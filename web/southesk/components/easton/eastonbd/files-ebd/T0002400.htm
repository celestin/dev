      <a name="T0002400"><b>Manasseh -</b> who makes to forget.
      &quot;God hath made me forget&quot; (Heb. nashshani), Gen.
      41:51. (1.) The elder of the two sons of Joseph. He and his
      brother Ephraim were afterwards adopted by Jacob as his own
      sons (48:1). There is an account of his marriage to a
      Syrian (1 Chr. 7:14); and the only thing afterwards
      recorded of him is, that his grandchildren were
      &quot;brought up upon Joseph&#39;s knees&quot; (Gen. 50:23;
      R.V., &quot;born upon Joseph&#39;s knees&quot;) i.e., were
      from their birth adopted by Joseph as his own children.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribe of Manasseh was associated with that of Ephraim
      and Benjamin during the wanderings in the wilderness. They
      encamped on the west side of the tabernacle. According to
      the census taken at Sinai, this tribe then numbered 32,200
      (Num. 1:10, 35; 2:20, 21). Forty years afterwards its
      numbers had increased to 52,700 (26:34, 37), and it was at
      this time the most distinguished of all the tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half of this tribe, along with Reuben and Gad, had
      their territory assigned them by Moses on the east of the
      Jordan (Josh. 13:7-14); but it was left for Joshua to
      define the limits of each tribe. This territory on the east
      of Jordan was more valuable and of larger extent than all
      that was allotted to the nine and a half tribes in the land
      of Palestine. It is sometimes called &quot;the land of
      Gilead,&quot; and is also spoken of as &quot;on the other
      side of Jordan.&quot; The portion given to the half tribe
      of Manasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan. It
      embraced the whole of Bashan. It was bounded on the south
      by Mahanaim, and extended north to the foot of Lebanon.
      Argob, with its sixty cities, that &quot;ocean of basaltic
      rocks and boulders tossed about in the wildest
      confusion,&quot; lay in the midst of this territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole &quot;land of Gilead&quot; having been conquered,
      the two and a half tribes left their wives and families in
      the fortified cities there, and accompanied the other
      tribes across the Jordan, and took part with them in the
      wars of conquest. The allotment of the land having been
      completed, Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes,
      commending them for their heroic service (Josh. 22:1-34).
      Thus dismissed, they returned over Jordan to their own
      inheritance. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001100.html&amp;from=T0001125&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      ED</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On the west of Jordan the other half of the tribe of
      Manasseh was associated with Ephraim, and they had their
      portion in the very centre of Palestine, an area of about
      1,300 square miles, the most valuable part of the whole
      country, abounding in springs of water. Manasseh&#39;s
      portion was immediately to the north of that of Ephraim
      (Josh. 16). Thus the western Manasseh defended the passes
      of Esdraelon as the eastern kept the passes of the Hauran.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The only son and successor of Hezekiah on the throne
      of Judah. He was twelve years old when he began to reign (2
      Kings 21:1), and he reigned fifty-five years (B.C.
      698-643). Though he reigned so long, yet comparatively
      little is known of this king. His reign was a continuation
      of that of Ahaz, both in religion and national polity. He
      early fell under the influence of the heathen court circle,
      and his reign was characterized by a sad relapse into
      idolatry with all its vices, showing that the reformation
      under his father had been to a large extent only
      superficial (Isa. 7:10; 2 Kings 21:10-15). A systematic and
      persistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to
      banish the worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this
      wide-spread idolatry there were not wanting, however,
      faithful prophets (Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice
      in reproof and in warning. But their fidelity only aroused
      bitter hatred, and a period of cruel persecution against
      all the friends of the old religion began. &quot;The days
      of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. in France, or of the
      Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland, were anticipated
      in the Jewish capital. The streets were red with
      blood.&quot; There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah
      was put to death at this time (2 Kings 21:16; 24:3, 4; Jer.
      2:30), having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree.
      Psalms 49, 73, 77, 140, and 141 seem to express the
      feelings of the pious amid the fiery trials of this great
      persecution. Manasseh has been called the &quot;Nero of
      Palestine.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Esarhaddon, Sennacherib&#39;s successor on the Assyrian
      throne, who had his residence in Babylon for thirteen years
      (the only Assyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon),
      took Manasseh prisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive
      kings were usually treated with great cruelty. They were
      brought before the conqueror with a hook or ring passed
      through their lips or their jaws, having a cord attached to
      it, by which they were led. This is referred to in 2 Chr.
      33:11, where the Authorized Version reads that Esarhaddon
      &quot;took Manasseh among the thorns;&quot; while the
      Revised Version renders the words, &quot;took Manasseh in
      chains;&quot; or literally, as in the margin, &quot;with
      hooks.&quot; (Comp. 2 Kings 19:28.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The severity of Manasseh&#39;s imprisonment brought him to
      repentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to his
      kingdom (2 Chr. 33:11-13). He abandoned his idolatrous
      ways, and enjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there
      was no thorough reformation. After a lengthened reign
      extending through fifty-five years, the longest in the
      history of Judah, he died, and was buried in the garden of
      Uzza, the &quot;garden of his own house&quot; (2 Kings
      21:17, 18; 2 Chr. 33:20), and not in the city of David,
      among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Judg. 18:30 the correct reading is &quot;Moses,&quot;
      and not &quot;Manasseh.&quot; The name &quot;Manasseh&quot;
      is supposed to have been introduced by some transcriber to
      avoid the scandal of naming the grandson of Moses the great
      lawgiver as the founder of an idolatrous religion.

      <a name="T0002401"><b>Mandrakes -</b> Hebrew dudaim; i.e.,
      &quot;love-plants&quot;, occurs only in Gen. 30:14-16 and
      Cant. 7:13. Many interpretations have been given of this
      word <i>dudaim</i>. It has been rendered
      &quot;violets,&quot; &quot;Lilies,&quot;
      &quot;jasmines,&quot; &quot;truffles or mushrooms,&quot;
      &quot;flowers,&quot; the &quot;citron,&quot; etc. The
      weight of authority is in favour of its being regarded as
      the Mandragora officinalis of botanists, &quot;a near
      relative of the night-shades, the &#39;apple of Sodom&#39;
      and the potato plant.&quot; It possesses stimulating and
      narcotic properties (Gen. 30:14-16). The fruit of this
      plant resembles the potato-apple in size, and is of a pale
      orange colour. It has been called the
      &quot;love-apple.&quot; The Arabs call it &quot;Satan&#39;s
      apple.&quot; It still grows near Jerusalem, and in other
      parts of Palestine.</a>

      rendered &quot;pound&quot; (1 Kings 10:17; Ezra 2:69; Neh.
      7:71, 72), a weight variously estimated, probably about 2
      1/2 or 3 lbs. A maneh of gold consisted of a hundred common
      shekels (q.v.). (Comp. 1 Kings 10:17, and 2 Chr. 9:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002403"><b>Manger -</b> (Luke 2:7, 12, 16), the
      name (Gr. phatne, rendered &quot;stall&quot; in Luke 13:15)
      given to the place where the infant Redeemer was laid. It
      seems to have been a stall or crib for feeding cattle.
      Stables and mangers in our modern sense were in ancient
      times unknown in the East. The word here properly denotes
      &quot;the ledge or projection in the end of the room used
      as a stall on which the hay or other food of the animals of
      travellers was placed.&quot; (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001800.html&amp;from=T0001883&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">

    <p>
      <a name="T0002404"><b>Manna -</b> Heb. man-hu, &quot;What
      is that?&quot; the name given by the Israelites to the food
      miraculously supplied to them during their wanderings in
      the wilderness (Ex. 16:15-35). The name is commonly taken
      as derived from <i>man</i>, an expression of surprise,
      &quot;What is it?&quot; but more probably it is derived
      from <i>manan</i>, meaning &quot;to allot,&quot; and hence
      denoting an &quot;allotment&quot; or a &quot;gift.&quot;
      This &quot;gift&quot; from God is described as &quot;a
      small round thing,&quot; like the &quot;hoar-frost on the
      ground,&quot; and &quot;like coriander seed,&quot; &quot;of
      the colour of bdellium,&quot; and in taste &quot;like
      wafers made with honey.&quot; It was capable of being baked
      and boiled, ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar (Ex.
      16:23; Num. 11:7). If any was kept over till the following
      morning, it became corrupt with worms; but as on the
      Sabbath none fell, on the preceding day a double portion
      was given, and that could be kept over to supply the wants
      of the Sabbath without becoming corrupt. Directions
      concerning the gathering of it are fully given (Ex.
      16:16-18, 33; Deut. 8:3, 16). It fell for the first time
      after the eighth encampment in the desert of Sin, and was
      daily furnished, except on the Sabbath, for all the years
      of the wanderings, till they encamped at Gilgal, after
      crossing the Jordan, when it suddenly ceased, and where
      they &quot;did eat of the old corn of the land; neither had
      the children of Israel manna any more&quot; (Josh. 5:12).
      They now no longer needed the &quot;bread of the
      wilderness.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This manna was evidently altogether a miraculous gift,
      wholly different from any natural product with which we are
      acquainted, and which bears this name. The manna of
      European commerce comes chiefly from Calabria and Sicily.
      It drops from the twigs of a species of ash during the
      months of June and July. At night it is fluid and resembles
      dew, but in the morning it begins to harden. The manna of
      the Sinaitic peninsula is an exudation from the
      &quot;manna-tamarisk&quot; tree (Tamarix mannifera), the
      el-tarfah of the Arabs. This tree is found at the present
      day in certain well-watered valleys in the peninsula of
      Sinai. The manna with which the people of Israel were fed
      for forty years differs in many particulars from all these
      natural products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord refers to the manna when he calls himself the
      &quot;true bread from heaven&quot; (John 6:31-35; 48-51).
      He is also the &quot;hidden manna&quot; (Rev. 2:17; comp.
      John 6:49,51).

      was probably a sheepskin. It appears to have been his only
      garment, a strip of skin or leather binding it to his
      loins. <i>&#39;Addereth</i> twice occurs with the epithet

      splendid under tunic wholly of blue, reaching to below the
      knees. It was woven without seam, and was put on by being
      drawn over the head. It was worn not only by priests but by
      kings (1 Sam. 24:4), prophets (15:27), and rich men (Job
      1:20; 2:12). This was the &quot;little coat&quot; which

      Dar, some regard as Parian marble. It is here rendered
      &quot;white marble.&quot; But nothing is certainly known of
      it. (3.) Bahat, &quot;red marble,&quot; probably the
      verd-antique or half-porphyry of Egypt. (4.) Sohareth,
      &quot;black marble,&quot; probably some spotted variety of
      marble. &quot;The marble pillars and tesserae of various
      colours of the palace at Susa came doubtless from Persia

      <a name="T0002419"><b>Mark -</b> the evangelist; &quot;John
      whose surname was Mark&quot; (Acts 12:12, 25). Mark
      (Marcus, Col. 4:10, etc.) was his Roman name, which
      gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is
      called John in Acts 13:5, 13, and Mark in 15:39, 2 Tim.
      4:11, etc.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means
      and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where
      his mother resided (Acts 12:12). Of his father we know
      nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10). It was in
      his mother&#39;s house that Peter found &quot;many gathered
      together praying&quot; when he was released from prison;
      and it is probable that it was here that he was converted
      by Peter, who calls him his &quot;son&quot; (1 Pet. 5:13).
      It is probable that the &quot;young man&quot; spoken of in
      Mark 14:51, 52 was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in
      Acts 12:25. He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first
      journey (about A.D. 47) as their &quot;minister,&quot; but
      from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in
      Pamphylia (Acts 12:25; 13:13). Three years afterwards a
      &quot;sharp contention&quot; arose between Paul and
      Barnabas (15:36-40), because Paul would not take Mark with
      him. He, however, was evidently at length reconciled to the
      apostle, for he was with him in his first imprisonment at
      Rome (Col. 4:10; Philemon 1:24). At a later period he was
      with Peter in Babylon (1 Pet. 5:13), then, and for some
      centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish
      learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul
      wrote him during his second imprisonment (2 Tim. 4:11). He
      then disappears from view.

      public resort, and hence a public place or broad street
      (Matt. 11:16; 20:3), as well as a forum or market-place
      proper, where goods were exposed for sale, and where public
      assemblies and trials were held (Acts 16:19; 17:17). This
      word occurs in the Old Testament only in Ezek. 27:13.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In early times markets were held at the gates of cities,
      where commodities were exposed for sale (2 Kings 7:18). In
      large towns the sale of particular articles seems to have
      been confined to certain streets, as we may infer from such
      expressions as &quot;the bakers&#39; street&quot; (Jer.
      37:21), and from the circumstance that in the time of
      Josephus the valley between Mounts Zion and Moriah was
      called the Tyropoeon or the &quot;valley of the
      cheesemakers.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002421"><b>Mark, Gospel according to -</b> It is
      the current and apparently well-founded tradition that Mark
      derived his information mainly from the discourses of
      Peter. In his mother&#39;s house he would have abundant
      opportunities of obtaining information from the other
      apostles and their coadjutors, yet he was &quot;the
      disciple and interpreter of Peter&quot; specially.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the time when it was written, the Gospel furnishes us
      with no definite information. Mark makes no mention of the
      destruction of Jerusalem, hence it must have been written
      before that event, and probably about A.D. 63.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place where it was written was probably Rome. Some have
      supposed Antioch (comp. Mark 15:21 with Acts 11:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was intended primarily for Romans. This appears probable
      when it is considered that it makes no reference to the
      Jewish law, and that the writer takes care to interpret
      words which a Gentile would be likely to misunderstand,
      such as, &quot;Boanerges&quot; (3:17); &quot;Talitha
      cumi&quot; (5:41); &quot;Corban&quot; (7:11);
      &quot;Bartimaeus&quot; (10:46); &quot;Abba&quot; (14:36);
      &quot;Eloi,&quot; etc. (15:34). Jewish usages are also
      explained (7:3; 14:3; 14:12; 15:42). Mark also uses certain
      Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as
      &quot;speculator&quot; (6:27, rendered, A.V.,
      &quot;executioner;&quot; R.V., &quot;soldier of his
      guard&quot;), &quot;xestes&quot; (a corruption of
      sextarius, rendered &quot;pots,&quot; 7:4, 8),
      &quot;quadrans&quot; (12:42, rendered &quot;a
      farthing&quot;), &quot;centurion&quot; (15:39, 44, 45). He
      only twice quotes from the Old Testament (1:2; 15:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      The characteristics of this Gospel are, (1) the absence of
      the genealogy of our Lord, (2) whom he represents as
      clothed with power, the &quot;lion of the tribe of
      Judah.&quot; (3.) Mark also records with wonderful
      minuteness the very words (3:17; 5:41; 7:11, 34; 14:36) as
      well as the position (9:35) and gestures (3:5, 34; 5:32;
      9:36; 10:16) of our Lord. (4.) He is also careful to record
      particulars of person (1:29, 36; 3:6, 22, etc.), number
      (5:13; 6:7, etc.), place (2:13; 4:1; 7:31, etc.), and time
      (1:35; 2:1; 4:35, etc.), which the other evangelists omit.
      (5.) The phrase &quot;and straightway&quot; occurs nearly
      forty times in this Gospel; while in Luke&#39;s Gospel,
      which is much longer, it is used only seven times, and in
      John only four times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The Gospel of Mark,&quot; says Westcott, &quot;is
      essentially a transcript from life. The course and issue of
      facts are imaged in it with the clearest outline.&quot;
      &quot;In Mark we have no attempt to draw up a continuous
      narrative. His Gospel is a rapid succession of vivid
      pictures loosely strung together without much attempt to
      bind them into a whole or give the events in their natural
      sequence. This pictorial power is that which specially
      characterizes this evangelist, so that &#39;if any one
      desires to know an evangelical fact, not only in its main
      features and grand results, but also in its most minute and
      so to speak more graphic delineation, he must betake
      himself to Mark.&#39;&quot; The leading principle running
      through this Gospel may be expressed in the motto:
      &quot;Jesus came...preaching the gospel of the
      kingdom&quot; (Mark 1:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Out of a total of 662 verses, Mark has 406 in common
      with Matthew and Luke, 145 with Matthew, 60 with Luke, and
      at most 51 peculiar to itself.&quot; (See <a href=

      army (Micah 1:12).</a>

      <a name="T0002423"><b>Marriage -</b> was instituted in
      Paradise when man was in innocence (Gen. 2:18-24). Here we
      have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord,
      as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed
      (Matt. 19:4, 5). It is evident that monogamy was the
      original law of marriage (Matt. 19:5; 1 Cor. 6:16). This
      law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began
      to be introduced (Gen. 4:19; 6:2). We meet with the
      prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal
      age (Gen. 16:1-4; 22:21-24; 28:8, 9; 29:23-30, etc.).
      Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the
      basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all
      down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity,
      after which there is no instance of it on record.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for
      fathers to select wives for their sons (Gen. 24:3; 38:6).
      Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of
      the maiden (Ex. 2:21). The brothers of the maiden were also
      sometimes consulted (Gen. 24:51; 34:11), but her own
      consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a
      price to the father of the maiden (31:15; 34:12; Ex. 22:16,
      17; 1 Sam. 18:23, 25; Ruth 4:10; Hos. 3:2) On these
      patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted
      and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at
      once and take away his bride to his own house (Gen.
      24:63-67). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a
      feast in the house of the bride&#39;s parents, to which all
      friends were invited (29:22, 27); and on the day of the
      marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was
      conducted to her future husband&#39;s home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the
      subject of marriage (Matt. 22:23-30), and placed it as a
      divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles
      state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and
      wife (Eph. 5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7). Marriage
      is said to be &quot;honourable&quot; (Heb. 13:4), and the
      prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of
      degenerate times (1 Tim. 4:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage relation is used to represent the union
      between God and his people (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1-14; Hos.
      2:9, 20). In the New Testament the same figure is employed
      in representing the love of Christ to his saints (Eph.
      5:25-27). The Church of the redeemed is the &quot;Bride,
      the Lamb&#39;s wife&quot; (Rev. 19:7-9).

      &quot;lasted usually for a whole week; but the cost of such

      sit round the great bowl or bowls on the floor, the meal
      usually consisting of a lamb or kid stewed in rice or
      barley. The most honoured guests sit nearest, others
      behind; and all in eating dip their hand into the one
      smoking mound, pieces of the thin bread, bent together,
      serving for spoons when necessary. After the first circle
      have satisfied themselves, those lower in honour sit down
      to the rest, the whole company being men, for women are
      never seen at a feast. Water is poured on the hands before
      eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes, the
      fingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which,
      after serving the same purpose as table-napkins with us,
      are thrown on the ground to be eaten by any dog that may
      have stolen in from the streets through the ever-open door,
      or picked up by those outside when gathered and tossed out
      to them (Matt. 15:27; Mark 7:28). Rising from the ground
      and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then
      sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or
      puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a
      small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a
      smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the
      room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor.
      As to the smoke, it escapes as it best may; but indeed
      there is little of it, though enough to blacken the water
      or wine or milk skins hung up on pegs on the wall. (Comp.
      Ps. 119:83.) To some such marriage-feast Jesus and his five

      house,&quot; some have supposed that she was a widow, and
      that her brother and sister lodged with her. She seems to
      have been of an anxious, bustling spirit, anxious to be
      helpful in providing the best things for the Master&#39;s
      use, in contrast to the quiet earnestness of Mary, who was
      more concerned to avail herself of the opportunity of
      sitting at his feet and learning of him. Afterwards at a

      &quot;Mary and Martha are representatives of two orders of
      human character. One was absorbed, preoccupied, abstracted;
      the other was concentrated and single-hearted. Her own
      world was the all of Martha; Christ was the first thought
      with Mary. To Martha life was &#39;a succession of
      particular businesses;&#39; to Mary life &#39;was rather
      the flow of one spirit.&#39; Martha was Petrine, Mary was
      Johannine. The one was a well-meaning, bustling busybody;
      the other was a reverent disciple, a wistful

      of what he has seen or known (Luke 24:48; Acts 1:8, 22;

      <a name="T0002428"><b>Mary -</b> Hebrew Miriam. (1.) The
      wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus, called the
      &quot;Virgin Mary,&quot; though never so designated in
      Scripture (Matt. 2:11; Acts 1:14). Little is known of her
      personal history. Her genealogy is given in Luke 3. She was
      of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David (Ps. 132:11;
      Luke 1:32). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth,
      who was of the lineage of Aaron (Luke 1:36).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she
      became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to
      her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah
      (Luke 1:35). After this she went to visit her cousin
      Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias
      (probably at Juttah, Josh. 15:55; 21:16, in the
      neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about
      100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house
      she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and
      then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving
      (Luke 1:46-56; comp. 1 Sam. 2:1-10). After three months
      Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was
      supernaturally made aware (Matt. 1:18-25) of her condition,
      and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of
      Augustus (Luke 2:1) required that they should proceed to
      Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth;
      and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or
      khan provided for strangers (Luke 2:6, 7). But as the inn
      was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the
      cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called
      Jesus (Matt. 1:21), because he was to save his people from
      their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the
      temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the
      following year and residence at Nazareth (Matt. 2). There
      for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter,
      resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over
      the strange things that had happened to her. During these
      years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded,
      viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age,
      and his being found among the doctors in the temple (Luke
      2:41-52). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for
      he is not again mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the commencement of our Lord&#39;s public ministry
      little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the
      marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her
      at Capernaum (Matt. 12:46, 48, 49), where Christ uttered
      the memorable words, &quot;Who is my mother? and who are my
      brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his
      disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my
      brethren!&quot; The next time we find her is at the cross
      along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome,
      and other women (John 19:26). From that hour John took her
      to his own abode. She was with the little company in the
      upper room after the Ascension (Acts 1:14). From this time
      she wholly disappears from public notice. The time and
      manner of her death are unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a town on the
      western shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first
      time noticed in Luke 8:3 as one of the women who
      &quot;ministered to Christ of their substance.&quot; Their
      motive was that of gratitude for deliverances he had
      wrought for them. Out of Mary were cast seven demons.
      Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to become his
      follower. These women accompanied him also on his last
      journey to Jerusalem (Matt. 27:55; Mark 15:41; Luke 23:55).
      They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was
      over, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph&#39;s
      tomb. Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the
      week she, with Salome and Mary the mother of James (Matt.
      28:1; Mark 16:2), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them
      sweet spices, that they might anoint the body of Jesus.
      They found the sepulchre empty, but saw the &quot;vision of
      angels&quot; (Matt. 28:5). She hastens to tell Peter and
      John, who were probably living together at this time (John
      20:1, 2), and again immediately returns to the sepulchre.
      There she lingers thoughtfully, weeping at the door of the
      tomb. The risen Lord appears to her, but at first she knows
      him not. His utterance of her name &quot;Mary&quot; recalls
      her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful, reverent
      cry, &quot;Rabboni.&quot; She would fain cling to him, but
      he forbids her, saying, &quot;Touch me not; for I am not
      yet ascended to my Father.&quot; This is the last record
      regarding Mary of Magdala, who now returned to Jerusalem.
      The idea that this Mary was &quot;the woman who was a
      sinner,&quot; or that she was unchaste, is altogether
      groundless.

    <p>
      (3.) Mary the sister of Lazarus is brought to our notice in
      connection with the visits of our Lord to Bethany. She is
      contrasted with her sister Martha, who was &quot;cumbered
      about many things&quot; while Jesus was their guest, while
      Mary had chosen &quot;the good part.&quot; Her character
      also appears in connection with the death of her brother
      (John 11:20,31,33). On the occasion of our Lord&#39;s last
      visit to Bethany, Mary brought &quot;a pound of ointment of
      spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of
      Jesus&quot; as he reclined at table in the house of one
      Simon, who had been a leper (Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; John
      12:2,3). This was an evidence of her overflowing love to
      the Lord. Nothing is known of her subsequent history. It
      would appear from this act of Mary&#39;s, and from the
      circumstance that they possessed a family vault (11:38),
      and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to
      condole with them on the death of Lazarus (11:19), that
      this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of
      the people. (See <a href=

      (4.) Mary the wife of Cleopas is mentioned (John 19:25) as
      standing at the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and
      Mary the mother of Jesus. By comparing Matt. 27:56 and Mark
      15:40, we find that this Mary and &quot;Mary the mother of
      James the little&quot; are on and the same person, and that
      she was the sister of our Lord&#39;s mother. She was that
      &quot;other Mary&quot; who was present with Mary of Magdala
      at the burial of our Lord (Matt. 27:61; Mark 15:47); and
      she was one of those who went early in the morning of the
      first day of the week to anoint the body, and thus became
      one of the first witnesses of the resurrection (Matt. 28:1;
      Mark 16:1; Luke 24:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest
      of our Lord&#39;s disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas
      (Col. 4:10), and joined with him in disposing of their land
      and giving the proceeds of the sale into the treasury of
      the Church (Acts 4:37; 12:12). Her house in Jerusalem was
      the common meeting-place for the disciples there.

      <a name="T0002442"><b>Matthew -</b> gift of God, a common
      Jewish name after the Exile. He was the son of Alphaeus,
      and was a publican or tax-gatherer at Capernaum. On one
      occasion Jesus, coming up from the side of the lake, passed
      the custom-house where Matthew was seated, and said to him,
      &quot;Follow me.&quot; Matthew arose and followed him, and
      became his disciple (Matt. 9:9). Formerly the name by which
      he was known was Levi (Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27); he now
      changed it, possibly in grateful memory of his call, to
      Matthew. The same day on which Jesus called him he made a
      &quot;great feast&quot; (Luke 5:29), a farewell feast, to
      which he invited Jesus and his disciples, and probably also
      many of old associates. He was afterwards selected as one
      of the twelve (6:15). His name does not occur again in the
      Gospel history except in the lists of the apostles. The
      last notice of him is in Acts 1:13. The time and manner of
      his death are unknown.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002443"><b>Matthew, Gospel according to -</b>
      The author of this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, an
      apostle of our Lord, whose name it bears. He wrote the
      Gospel of Christ according to his own plans and aims, and
      from his own point of view, as did also the other
      &quot;evangelists.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the time of its composition, there is little in the
      Gospel itself to indicate. It was evidently written before
      the destruction of Jerusalem (Matt. 24), and some time
      after the events it records. The probability is that it was
      written between the years A.D. 60 and 65.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by
      the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish
      Christians of Palestine. His great object is to prove that
      Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him
      the ancient prophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is
      full of allusions to those passages of the Old Testament in
      which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim
      prevading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he
      &quot;of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did
      write.&quot; This Gospel contains no fewer than sixty-five
      references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being
      direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those
      found in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel
      may be expressed in the motto, &quot;I am not come to
      destroy, but to fulfil.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the language in which this Gospel was written there
      is much controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old
      tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e.,
      the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of
      the inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated
      into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by some person
      unknown. This theory, though earnestly maintained by able
      critics, we cannot see any ground for adopting. From the
      first this Gospel in Greek was received as of authority in
      the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a
      translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet
      they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language. The
      same reasons which would have suggested the necessity of a
      translation into Greek would have led the evangelist to
      write in Greek at first. It is confessed that this Gospel
      has never been found in any other form than that in which
      we now possess it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it sets
      forth the kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the
      true heir to David&#39;s throne. It is the Gospel of the
      kingdom. Matthew uses the expression &quot;kingdom of
      heaven&quot; (thirty-two times), while Luke uses the
      expression &quot;kingdom of God&quot; (thirty-three times).
      Some Latinized forms occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes
      (Matt. 5:26), for the Latin quadrans, and phragello
      (27:26), for the Latin flagello. It must be remembered that
      Matthew was a tax-gatherer for the Roman government, and
      hence in contact with those using the Latin language.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the relation of the Gospels to each other, we must
      maintain that each writer of the synoptics (the first
      three) wrote independently of the other two, Matthew being
      probably first in point of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Out of a total of 1071 verses, Matthew has 387 in
      common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke;
      only 387 being peculiar to itself.&quot; (See MARK

      We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform
      records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They
      appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from
      the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the
      predominant race for a while in the Mesopotamian valley.
      They consisted for three or four centuries of a number of
      tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at length were
      brought under the Assyrian yoke (2 Kings 17:6). From this
      subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves
      into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch
      entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and
      invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of
      Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian
      monarchy (Nah. 1:8; 2:5,6; 3:13, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending
      its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent
      kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it
      passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and
      successor Astyages, the Persians waged war against the
      Medes and conquered them, the two nations being united
      under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C. 558).
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;cities of the Medes&quot; are first mentioned in
      connection with the deportation of the Israelites on the
      destruction of Samaria (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11). Soon
      afterwards Isaiah (13:17; 21:2) speaks of the part taken by
      the Medes in the destruction of Babylon (comp. Jer. 51:11,
      28). Daniel gives an account of the reign of Darius the
      Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus (Dan. 6:1-28). The
      decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us (6:2-5), was found in
      &quot;the palace that is in the province of the
      Medes,&quot; Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is
      the only Median city mentioned in Scripture.

      <a name="T0002461"><b>Mediator -</b> one who intervenes
      between two persons who are at variance, with a view to

      in the word &quot;daysman&quot; (q.v.), marg.,
      &quot;umpire.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is used in the New Testament to denote simply an
      internuncius, an ambassador, one who acts as a medium of
      communication between two contracting parties. In this
      sense Moses is called a mediator in Gal. 3:19.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ is the one and only mediator between God and man (1
      Tim. 2:5; Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24). He makes reconciliation
      between God and man by his all-perfect atoning sacrifice.
      Such a mediator must be at once divine and human, divine,
      that his obedience and his sufferings might possess
      infinite worth, and that he might possess infinite wisdom
      and knowlege and power to direct all things in the kingdoms
      of providence and grace which are committed to his hands
      (Matt. 28:18; John 5:22, 25, 26, 27); and human, that in
      his work he might represent man, and be capable of
      rendering obedience to the law and satisfying the claims of
      justice (Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15, 16), and that in his
      glorified humanity he might be the head of a glorified
      Church (Rom. 8:29).

    <p>
      This office involves the three functions of prophet,
      priest, and king, all of which are discharged by Christ
      both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These
      functions are so inherent in the one office that the
      quality appertaining to each gives character to every
      mediatorial act. They are never separated in the exercise
      of the office of mediator.

      this spirit is enjoined (Col. 3:12; 1 Tim. 6:11; Zeph.
      2:3), and is exemplified in Christ (Matt. 11:29), Abraham
      (Gen. 13; 16:5, 6) Moses (Num. 12:3), David (Zech. 12:8; 2

      does not seem to have been fully occupied by the Israelites
      till the time of Solomon (1 Kings 4:12; 9:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley or plain of Megiddo was part of the plain of
      Esdraelon, the great battle-field of Palestine. It was here
      Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of
      Hazor, whose general, Sisera, led on the hostile army.
      Barak rallied the warriors of the northern tribes, and
      under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the prophetess,
      attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of
      Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed
      in the waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed
      its banks (Judg. 4:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years after this (B.C. 610), Pharaohnecho II., on his
      march against the king of Assyria, passed through the
      plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting
      to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated
      by the Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as
      they bore him away in his chariot towards Jerusalem (2
      Kings 23:29; 2 Chr. 35:22-24), and all Israel mourned for
      him. So general and bitter was this mourning that it became
      a proverb, to which Zechariah (12:11, 12) alludes. Megiddo
      has been identified with the modern el-Lejjun, at the head
      of the Kishon, under the north-eastern brow of Carmel, on
      the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and 9
      miles west of Jezreel. Others identify it with
      Mujedd&#39;a, 4 miles south-west of Bethshean, but the

      Maonites who inhabited the country on the eastern side of

      (R.V.), in the reign of King Hezekiah, as a Hamite people,
      settled in the eastern end of the valley of Gedor, in the

      is recorded in Gen. 14:18-20. He is subsequently mentioned
      only once in the Old Testament, in Ps. 110:4. The typical
      significance of his history is set forth in detail in the
      Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out
      the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these
      several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he
      blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives
      for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the
      person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in
      Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6)
      he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his
      priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by
      death: &quot;this man, because he continueth ever, hath an
      unchangeable priesthood.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The question as to who this mysterious personage was has
      given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an
      old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of
      Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a
      Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in
      his peculiar history and character an instructive type of
      our Lord, the great High Priest (Heb. 5:6, 7; 6:20). One of
      the Amarna tablets is from Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, the
      successor of Melchizedek, in which he claims the very
      attributes and dignity given to Melchizedek in the Epistle
      to the Hebrews.

      with a shore.&quot; It is about 2 miles deep and 1 broad,
      and the whole physical condition of the scene answers the

      originally colonized by Phoenicians
      (&quot;barbarians,&quot; 28:2). It came into the possession
      of the Greeks (B.C. 736), from whom it was taken by the
      Carthaginians (B.C. 528). In B.C. 242 it was conquered by
      the Romans, and was governed by a Roman propraetor at the
      time of the shipwreck (Acts 28:7). Since 1800, when the
      French garrison surrendered to the English force, it has
      been a British dependency. The island is about 17 miles

      grandfather fell on Mount Gilboa. The child&#39;s nurse
      hearing of this calamity, fled with him from Gibeah, the
      royal residence, and stumbling in her haste, the child was
      thrown to the ground and maimed in both his feet, and ever
      after was unable to walk (19:26). He was carried to the
      land of Gilead, where he found a refuge in the house of
      Machir, the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar, by whom he was
      brought up.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years after this, when David had subdued all the
      adversaries of Israel, he began to think of the family of
      Jonathan, and discovered that Mephibosheth was residing in
      the house of Machir. Thither he sent royal messengers, and
      brought him and his infant son to Jerusalem, where he ever
      afterwards resided (2 Sam. 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      When David was a fugitive, according to the story of Ziba
      (2 Sam. 16:1-4) Mephibosheth proved unfaithful to him, and
      was consequently deprived of half of his estates; but
      according to his own story, however (19:24-30), he had
      remained loyal to his friend. After this incident he is
      only mentioned as having been protected by David against
      the vengeance the Gibeonites were permitted to execute on
      the house of Saul (21:7). He is also called Merib-baal (1
      Chr. 8:34; 9:40). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0002486"><b>Merab -</b> increase, the eldest of
      Saul&#39;s two daughters (1 Sam. 14:49). She was betrothed
      to David after his victory over Goliath, but does not seem
      to have entered heartily into this arrangement (18:2, 17,
      19). She was at length, however, married to Adriel of
      Abel-Meholah, a town in the Jordan valley, about 10 miles
      south of Bethshean, with whom the house of Saul maintained
      alliance. She had five sons, who were all put to death by
      the Gibeonites on the hill of Gibeah (2 Sam. 21:8).</a>

      <a name="T0002489"><b>Merari -</b> sad; bitter, the
      youngest son of Levi, born before the descent of Jacob into
      Egypt, and one of the seventy who accompanied him thither
      (Gen. 46:11; Ex. 6:16). He became the head of one of the
      great divisions of the Levites (Ex. 6:19). (See <a href=

      MERARITES</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002490"><b>Merarites -</b> the descendants of
      Merari (Num. 26:57). They with the Gershonites and the
      Kohathites had charge of the tabernacle, which they had to
      carry from place to place (Num. 3:20, 33-37; 4:29-33). In
      the distribution of the oxen and waggons offered by the
      princes (Num. 7), Moses gave twice as many to the Merarites
      (four waggons and eight oxen) as he gave to the
      Gershonites, because the latter had to carry only the
      lighter furniture of the tabernacle, such as the curtains,
      hangings, etc., while the former had to carry the heavier
      portion, as the boards, bars, sockets, pillars, etc., and
      consequently needed a greater supply of oxen and waggons.
      This is a coincidence illustrative of the truth of the
      narrative. Their place in marching and in the camp was on
      the north of the tabernacle. The Merarites afterwards took
      part with the other Levitical families in the various
      functions of their office (1 Chr. 23:6, 21-23; 2 Chr.
      29:12, 13). Twelve cities with their suburbs were assigned
      to them (Josh. 21:7, 34-40).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002491"><b>Merathaim -</b> double rebellion,
      probably a symbolical name given to Babylon (Jer. 50:21),
      denoting rebellion exceeding that of other nations.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002492"><b>Merchant -</b> The Hebrew word so
      rendered is from a root meaning &quot;to travel
      about,&quot; &quot;to migrate,&quot; and hence &quot;a
      traveller.&quot; In the East, in ancient times, merchants
      travelled about with their merchandise from place to place
      (Gen. 37:25; Job 6:18), and carried on their trade mainly
      by bartering (Gen. 37:28; 39:1). After the Hebrews became
      settled in Palestine they began to engage in commercial
      pursuits, which gradually expanded (49:13; Deut. 33:18;
      Judg. 5:17), till in the time of Solomon they are found in
      the chief marts of the world (1 Kings 9:26; 10:11, 26, 28;
      22:48; 2 Chr. 1:16; 9:10, 21). After Solomon&#39;s time
      their trade with foreign nations began to decline. After
      the Exile it again expanded into wider foreign relations,
      because now the Jews were scattered in many lands.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002493"><b>Mercurius -</b> the Hermes (i.e.,
      &quot;the speaker&quot;) of the Greeks (Acts 14:12), a
      heathen God represented as the constant attendant of
      Jupiter, and the god of eloquence. The inhabitants of
      Lystra took Paul for this god because he was the
      &quot;chief speaker.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002494"><b>Mercy -</b> compassion for the
      miserable. Its object is misery. By the atoning sacrifice
      of Christ a way is open for the exercise of mercy towards
      the sons of men, in harmony with the demands of truth and
      righteousness (Gen. 19:19; Ex. 20:6; 34:6, 7; Ps. 85:10;
      86:15, 16). In Christ mercy and truth meet together. Mercy
      is also a Christian grace (Matt. 5:7; 18:33-35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002495"><b>Mercy-seat -</b> (Heb. kapporeth, a
      &quot;covering;&quot; LXX. and N.T., hilasterion; Vulg.,
      propitiatorium), the covering or lid of the ark of the
      covenant (q.v.). It was of acacia wood, overlaid with gold,
      or perhaps rather a plate of solid gold, 2 1/2 cubits long
      and 1 1/2 broad (Ex. 25:17; 30:6; 31:7). It is compared to
      the throne of grace (Heb. 9:5; Eph. 2:6). The holy of
      holies is called the &quot;place of the mercy-seat&quot; (1
      Chr. 28:11: Lev. 16:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been conjectured that the censer (thumiaterion,
      meaning &quot;anything having regard to or employed in the
      burning of incense&quot;) mentioned in Heb. 9:4 was the
      &quot;mercy-seat,&quot; at which the incense was burned by
      the high priest on the great day of atonement, and upon or
      toward which the blood of the goat was sprinkled (Lev.
      16:11-16; comp. Num. 7:89 and Ex. 25:22).

      <a name="T0002496"><b>Mered -</b> rebellion, one of the
      sons of Ezra, of the tribe of Judah (1 Chr. 4:17).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002497"><b>Meremoth -</b> exaltations, heights,
      a priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (Neh.
      12:3), to whom were sent the sacred vessels (Ezra 8:33)
      belonging to the temple. He took part in rebuilding the
      walls of Jerusalem (Neh. 3:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002498"><b>Meribah -</b> quarrel or strife. (1.)
      One of the names given by Moses to the fountain in the
      desert of Sin, near Rephidim, which issued from the rock in
      Horeb, which he smote by the divine command, &quot;because
      of the chiding of the children of Israel&quot; (Ex.
      17:1-7). It was also called Massah (q.v.). It was probably
      in Wady Feiran, near Mount Serbal.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another fountain having a similar origin in the desert
      of Zin, near to Kadesh (Num. 27:14). The two places are
      mentioned together in Deut. 33:8. Some think the one place
      is called by the two names (Ps. 81:7). In smiting the rock
      at this place Moses showed the same impatience as the
      people (Num. 20:10-12). This took place near the close of
      the wanderings in the desert (Num. 20:1-24; Deut. 32:51).

      4:4), the son of Jonathan. </a>
