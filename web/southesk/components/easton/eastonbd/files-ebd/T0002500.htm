      <a name="T0002500"><b>Merodach -</b> death; slaughter, the
      name of a Babylonian god, probably the planet Mars (Jer.
      50:2), or it may be another name of Bel, the guardian
      divinity of Babylon. This name frequently occurs as a
      surname to the kings of Assyria and Babylon.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002501"><b>Merodach-baladan -</b> Merodach has
      given a son, (Isa. 39:1), &quot;the hereditary chief of the
      Chaldeans, a small tribe at that time settled in the
      marshes at the mouth of the Euphrates, but in consequence
      of his conquest of Babylon afterwards, they became the
      dominant caste in Babylonia itself.&quot; One bearing this
      name sent ambassadors to Hezekiah (B.C. 721). He is also
      called Berodach-baladan (2 Kings 20:12; 2 Chr. 20:31). (See

      <a name="T0002502"><b>Merom -</b> height, a lake in
      Northern Palestine through which the Jordan flows. It was
      the scene of the third and last great victory gained by
      Joshua over the Canaanites (Josh. 11:5-7). It is not again
      mentioned in Scripture. Its modern name is Bakrat el-Huleh.
      &quot;The Ard el-Huleh, the centre of which the lake
      occupies, is a nearly level plain of 16 miles in length
      from north to south, and its breadth from east to west is
      from 7 to 8 miles. On the west it is walled in by the steep
      and lofty range of the hills of Kedesh-Naphtali; on the
      east it is bounded by the lower and more gradually
      ascending slopes of Bashan; on the north it is shut in by a
      line of hills hummocky and irregular in shape and of no
      great height, and stretching across from the mountains of
      Naphtali to the roots of Mount Hermon, which towers up at
      the north-eastern angle of the plain to a height of 10,000
      feet. At its southern extremity the plain is similarly
      traversed by elevated and broken ground, through which, by
      deep and narrow clefts, the Jordan, after passing through
      Lake Huleh, makes its rapid descent to the Sea of
      Galilee.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lake is triangular in form, about 4 1/2 miles in length
      by 3 1/2 at its greatest breadth. Its surface is 7 feet
      above that of the Mediterranean. It is surrounded by a
      morass, which is thickly covered with canes and papyrus
      reeds, which are impenetrable. Macgregor with his canoe,
      the Rob Roy, was the first that ever, in modern times,
      sailed on its waters. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0002503"><b>Meronothite -</b> a name given to
      Jehdeiah, the herdsman of the royal asses in the time of
      David and Solomon (1 Chr. 27:30), probably as one being a
      native of some unknown town called Meronoth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002504"><b>Meroz -</b> a plain in the north of
      Palestine, the inhabitants of which were severely condemned
      because they came not to help Barak against Sisera (Judg.
      5:23: comp. 21:8-10; 1 Sam. 11:7). It has been identified
      with Marassus, on a knoll to the north of Wady Jalud, but
      nothing certainly is known of it. Like Chorazin, it is only
      mentioned in Scripture in connection with the curse
      pronounced upon it.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002505"><b>Mesha -</b> middle district, Vulgate,
      Messa. (1.) A plain in that part of the boundaries of
      Arabia inhabited by the descendants of Joktan (Gen.
      10:30).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. meysh&#39;a, &quot;deliverance,&quot; the eldest
      son of Caleb (1 Chr. 2:42), and brother of Jerahmeel.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. id, a king of Moab, the son of Chemosh-Gad, a man
      of great wealth in flocks and herds (2 Kings 3:4). After
      the death of Ahab at Ramoth-Gilead, Mesha shook off the
      yoke of Israel; but on the ascension of Jehoram to the
      throne of Israel, that king sought the help of Jehoshaphat
      in an attempt to reduce the Moabites again to their former
      condition. The united armies of the two kings came
      unexpectedly on the army of the Moabites, and gained over
      them an easy victory. The whole land was devastated by the
      conquering armies, and Mesha sought refuge in his last
      stronghold, Kir-harasheth (q.v.). Reduced to despair, he
      ascended the wall of the city, and there, in the sight of
      the allied armies, offered his first-born son a sacrifice
      to Chemosh, the fire-god of the Moabites. This fearful
      spectacle filled the beholders with horror, and they
      retired from before the besieged city, and recrossed the
      Jordan laden with spoil (2 Kings 3:25-27).
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploits of Mesha are recorded in the Phoenician
      inscription on a block of black basalt found at Dibon, in
      Moab, usually called the &quot;Moabite stone&quot; (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002506"><b>Meshach -</b> the title given to
      Mishael, one of the three Hebrew youths who were under
      training at the Babylonian court for the rank of Magi (Dan.
      1:7; 2:49; 3:12-30). This was probably the name of some
      Chaldean god.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002507"><b>Meshech -</b> drawing out, the sixth
      son of Japheth (Gen. 10:2), the founder of a tribe (1 Chr.
      1:5; Ezek. 27:13; 38:2,3). They were in all probability the
      Moschi, a people inhabiting the Moschian Mountains, between
      the Black and the Caspian Seas. In Ps. 120:5 the name
      occurs as simply a synonym for foreigners or barbarians.
      &quot;During the ascendency of the Babylonians and Persians
      in Western Asia, the Moschi were subdued; but it seems
      probable that a large number of them crossed the Caucasus
      range and spread over the northern steppes, mingling with
      the Scythians. There they became known as Muscovs, and gave
      that name to the Russian nation and its ancient capital by
      which they are still generally known throughout the
      East&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002508"><b>Meshelemiah -</b> friendship of
      Jehovah, a Levite of the family of the Korhites, called
      also Shelemiah (1 Chr. 9:21; 26:1, 2, 9, 14). He was a
      temple gate-keeper in the time of David.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002509"><b>Meshillemoth -</b> requitals. (1.)
      The father of Berechiah (2 Chr. 28:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A priest, the son of Immer (Neh. 11:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002510"><b>Meshullam -</b> befriended. (1.) One
      of the chief Gadites in Bashan in the time of Jotham (1
      Chr. 5:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Grandfather of Shaphan, &quot;the scribe,&quot; in the
      reign of Josiah (2 Kings 22:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A priest, father of Hilkiah (1 Chr. 9:11; Neh. 11:11),
      in the reign of Ammon; called Shallum in 1 Chr. 6:12.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A Levite of the family of Kohath (2 Chr. 34:12), in
      the reign of Josiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) 1 Chr. 8:17.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) 1 Chr. 3:19.
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) Neh. 12:13.

    <p>
      (8.) A chief priest (Neh. 12:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (9.) One of the leading Levites in the time of Ezra (8:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (10.) A priest (1 Chr. 9:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      (11.) One of the principal Israelites who supported Ezra
      when expounding the law to the people (Neh. 8:4).

    <p>
      <a name="T0002511"><b>Meshullemeth -</b> friend, the wife
      of Manasseh, and the mother of Amon (2 Kings 21:19), Kings
      of Judah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002512"><b>Mesopotamia -</b> the country between
      the two rivers (Heb. Aram-naharaim; i.e., &quot;Syria of
      the two rivers&quot;), the name given by the Greeks and
      Romans to the region between the Euphrates and the Tigris
      (Gen. 24:10; Deut. 23:4; Judg. 3:8, 10). In the Old
      Testament it is mentioned also under the name
      &quot;Padan-aram;&quot; i.e., the plain of Aram, or Syria
      (Gen. 25:20). The northern portion of this fertile plateau
      was the original home of the ancestors of the Hebrews (Gen.
      11; Acts 7:2). From this region Isaac obtained his wife
      Rebecca (Gen. 24:10, 15), and here also Jacob sojourned
      (28:2-7) and obtained his wives, and here most of his sons
      were born (35:26; 46:15). The petty, independent tribes of
      this region, each under its own prince, were warlike, and
      used chariots in battle. They maintained their independence
      till after the time of David, when they fell under the
      dominion of Assyria, and were absorbed into the empire (2
      Kings 19:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002513"><b>Mess -</b> a portion of food given to
      a guest (Gen. 43:34; 2 Sam. 11:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002514"><b>Messenger -</b> (Heb. mal&#39;ak, Gr.
      angelos), an angel, a messenger who runs on foot, the
      bearer of despatches (Job 1:14; 1 Sam. 11:7; 2 Chr. 36:22);
      swift of foot (2 Kings 9:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002515"><b>Messiah -</b> (Heb. mashiah), in all
      the thirty-nine instances of its occurring in the Old
      Testament, is rendered by the LXX. &quot;Christos.&quot; It
      means anointed. Thus priests (Ex. 28:41; 40:15; Num. 3:3),
      prophets (1 Kings 19:16), and kings (1 Sam. 9:16; 16:3; 2
      Sam. 12:7) were anointed with oil, and so consecrated to
      their respective offices. The great Messiah is anointed
      &quot;above his fellows&quot; (Ps. 45:7); i.e., he embraces
      in himself all the three offices. The Greek form
      &quot;Messias&quot; is only twice used in the New
      Testament, in John 1:41 and 4:25 (R.V.,
      &quot;Messiah&quot;), and in the Old Testament the word
      Messiah, as the rendering of the Hebrew, occurs only twice
      (Dan 9:25, 26; R.V., &quot;the anointed one&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first great promise (Gen. 3:15) contains in it the germ
      of all the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament
      regarding the coming of the Messiah and the great work he
      was to accomplish on earth. The prophecies became more
      definite and fuller as the ages rolled on; the light shone
      more and more unto the perfect day. Different periods of
      prophetic revelation have been pointed out, (1) the
      patriarchal; (2) the Mosaic; (3) the period of David; (4)
      the period of prophetism, i.e., of those prophets whose
      works form a part of the Old Testament canon. The
      expectations of the Jews were thus kept alive from
      generation to generation, till the &quot;fulness of the
      times,&quot; when Messiah came, &quot;made of a woman, made
      under the law, to redeem them that were under the
      law.&quot; In him all these ancient prophecies have their
      fulfilment. Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the great
      Deliverer who was to come. (Comp. Matt. 26:54; Mark 9:12;
      Luke 18:31; 22:37; John 5:39; Acts 2; 16:31; 26:22, 23.)

      whose history so far is introduced in Judg. 17, apparently
      for the purpose of leading to an account of the settlement
      of the tribe of Dan in Northern Palestine, and for the
      purpose also of illustrating the lawlessness of the times
      in which he lived (Judg. 18; 19:1-29; 21:25).</a>

      (5.) &quot;The Morasthite,&quot; so called to distinguish
      him from Micaiah, the son of Imlah (1 Kings 22:8). He was a
      prophet of Judah, a contemporary of Isaiah (Micah 1:1), a
      native of Moresheth of Gath (1:14, 15). Very little is
      known of the circumstances of his life (comp. Jer. 26:18,

      <a name="T0002525"><b>Micah, Book of -</b> the sixth in
      order of the so-called minor prophets. The superscription
      to this book states that the prophet exercised his office
      in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. If we reckon
      from the beginning of Jotham&#39;s reign to the end of
      Hezekiah&#39;s (B.C. 759-698), then he ministered for about
      fifty-nine years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham
      to the accession of Hezekiah (B.C. 743-726), his ministry
      lasted only sixteen years. It has been noticed as
      remarkable that this book commences with the last words of
      another prophet, &quot;Micaiah the son of Imlah&quot; (1
      Kings 22:28): &quot;Hearken, O people, every one of
      you.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a
      rebuke, &quot;Hear ye,&quot; etc., and closing with a
      promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to
      the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which
      Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his
      people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the
      great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his
      people. The closing verse is quoted in the song of
      Zacharias (Luke 1:72, 73). The prediction regarding the
      place &quot;where Christ should be born,&quot; one of the
      most remarkable Messianic prophecies (Micah 5:2), is quoted
      in Matt. 2:6.

      the son of Imlah, a faithful prophet of Samaria (1 Kings
      22:8-28). Three years after the great battle with Ben-hadad
      (20:29-34), Ahab proposed to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah,
      that they should go up against Ramoth-Gilead to do battle
      again with Ben-hadad. Jehoshaphat agreed, but suggested
      that inquiry should be first made &quot;at the word of
      Jehovah.&quot; Ahab&#39;s prophets approved of the
      expedition; but Jehoshaphat, still dissatisfied, asked if
      there was no other prophet besides the four hundred that
      had appeared, and was informed of this Micaiah. He was sent
      for from prison, where he had been confined, probably on
      account of some prediction disagreeable to Ahab; and he
      condemned the expedition, and prophesied that it would end,
      as it did, in disaster. We hear nothing further of this
      prophet. Some have supposed that he was the unnamed prophet
      referred to in 1 Kings 20:35-42.</a>

      the younger of Saul&#39;s two daughters by his wife Ahinoam
      (1 Sam. 14:49, 50). &quot;Attracted by the graces of his
      person and the gallantry of his conduct, she fell in love
      with David and became his wife&quot; (18:20-28). She showed
      her affection for him by promoting his escape to Naioth
      when Saul sought his life (1 Sam. 19:12-17. Comp. Ps. 59.
      See TERAPHIM &macr;T0003618). After this she did not see
      David for many years. Meanwhile she was given in marriage
      to another man, Phalti or Phaltiel of Gallim (1 Sam.
      25:44), but David afterwards formally reclaimed her as his
      lawful wife (2 Sam. 3:13-16). The relation between her and
      David soon after this was altered. They became alienated
      from each other. This happened on that memorable day when
      the ark was brought up in great triumph from its temporary
      resting-place to the Holy City. In David&#39;s conduct on
      that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of
      the royal dignity (1 Chr. 15:29). She remained childless,
      and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed. In 2
      Sam. 21:8 her name again occurs, but the name Merab should
      probably be here substituted for Michal (comp. 1 Sam.

      the north side of the steep and precipitous Wady
      es-Suweinit (&quot;valley of the little thorn-tree&quot; or
      &quot;the acacia&quot;), and now bears the name of Mukhmas.
      This wady is called &quot;the passage of Michmash&quot; (1

    <p>
      <a name="T0002537"><b>Midianite -</b> an Arabian tribe
      descended from Midian. They inhabited principally the
      desert north of the peninsula of Arabia. The peninsula of
      Sinai was the pasture-ground for their flocks. They were
      virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe.
      Like all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early
      engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their
      caravans that Joseph was sold (Gen. 37:28, 36). The next
      notice of them is in connection with Moses&#39; flight from
      Egypt (Ex. 2:15-21). Here in Midian Moses became the
      servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro,
      the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly
      to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their
      outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but
      when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered
      into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the
      king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them (Num. 22:4-7).
      Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having
      utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab;
      nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and
      induced them to enter into correspondence with the
      Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them
      in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of
      Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites
      took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon
      themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them
      a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and
      more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished (Num.
      25:9). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A
      terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand
      warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas,
      went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly
      routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their
      kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed
      (Josh. 13:21, 22). Balaam also perished by the sword,
      receiving the &quot;wages of his unrighteousness&quot;
      (Num. 31:8; 2 Pet. 2:15). The whole of the country on the
      east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (see SIHON
      &macr;T0003427; OG &macr;T0002771), was divided between the
      two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of
      Manasseh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites
      had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with
      the Amalekites and the &quot;children of the east&quot;
      they made war against their old enemies the Israelites,
      whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection.
      They were at length assailed by Gideon in that
      ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and
      utterly destroyed (Judg. 6:1-ch. 7). Frequent allusions are
      afterwards made to this great victory (Ps. 83:10, 12; Isa.
      9:4; 10:6). They now wholly pass away from the page of
      history both sacred and profane.

      It is frequently mentioned in connection with honey (Ex.
      3:8; 13:5; Josh. 5:6; Isa. 7:15, 22; Jer. 11:5). Sheep
      (Deut. 32:14) and goats (Prov. 27:27) and camels (Gen.
      32:15), as well as cows, are made to give their milk for
      the use of man. Milk is used figuratively as a sign of
      abundance (Gen. 49:12; Ezek. 25:4; Joel 3:18). It is also a
      symbol of the rudiments of doctrine (1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:12,

      also more frequently &quot;cream,&quot; or perhaps, as some
      think, &quot;curdled milk,&quot; such as that which Abraham
      set before the angels (Gen. 18:8), and which Jael gave to
      Sisera (Judg. 5:25). In this state milk was used by
      travellers (2 Sam. 17:29). If kept long enough, it acquired
      a slightly intoxicating or soporific power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Hebrew word is also sometimes used for milk in general
      (Deut. 32:14; Job 20:17).

      <a name="T0002550"><b>Mill -</b> for grinding corn,
      mentioned as used in the time of Abraham (Gen. 18:6). That
      used by the Hebrews consisted of two circular stones, each
      2 feet in diameter and half a foot thick, the lower of
      which was called the &quot;nether millstone&quot; (Job
      41:24) and the upper the &quot;rider.&quot; The upper stone
      was turned round by a stick fixed in it as a handle. There
      were then no public mills, and thus each family required to
      be provided with a hand-mill. The corn was ground daily,
      generally by the women of the house (Isa. 47:1, 2; Matt.
      24:41). It was with the upper stone of a hand-mill that
      &quot;a certain woman&quot; at Thebez broke Abimelech&#39;s
      skull (Judg. 9:53, &quot;a piece of a millstone;&quot;
      literally, &quot;a millstone rider&quot;, i.e., the
      &quot;runner,&quot; the stone which revolves. Comp. 2 Sam.
      11:21). Millstones could not be pledged (Deut. 24:6), as
      they were necessary in every family.</a>

      <a name="T0002551"><b>Millennium -</b> a thousand years;
      the name given to the era mentioned in Rev. 20:1-7. Some
      maintain that Christ will personally appear on earth for
      the purpose of establishing his kingdom at the beginning of
      this millennium. Those holding this view are usually called
      &quot;millenarians.&quot; On the other hand, it is
      maintained, more in accordance with the teaching of
      Scripture, we think, that Christ&#39;s second advent will
      not be premillennial, and that the right conception of the
      prospects and destiny of his kingdom is that which is
      taught, e.g., in the parables of the leaven and the
      mustard-seed. The triumph of the gospel, it is held, must
      be looked for by the wider and more efficient operation of
      the very forces that are now at work in extending the
      gospel; and that Christ will only come again at the close
      of this dispensation to judge the world at the &quot;last

      East as one of the smaller corn-grasses. This seed is the
      cenchros of the Greeks. It is called in India warree, and
      by the Arabs dukhan, and is extensively used for food,
      being often mixed with other grain. In this country it is

      filled in with earth and stones, which protected Jerusalem
      on the north as its outermost defence. It is always
      rendered Akra i.e., &quot;the citadel&quot;, in the LXX. It
      was already existing when David conquered Jerusalem (2 Sam.
      5:9). He extended it to the right and left, thus completing
      the defence of the city. It was rebuilt by Solomon (1 Kings

      <a name="T0002554"><b>Mincing -</b> (Heb. taphoph, Isa.
      3:16), taking affectedly short and quick steps. Luther
      renders the word by &quot;wag&quot; or &quot;waggle,&quot;
      thus representing &quot;the affected gait of coquettish
      females.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002555"><b>Mine -</b> The process of mining is
      described in Job 28:1-11. Moses speaks of the mineral
      wealth of Palestine (Deut. 8:9). Job 28:4 is rightly thus
      rendered in the Revised Version, &quot;He breaketh open a
      shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of
      the foot [that passeth by]; they hang afar from men, they
      swing to and fro.&quot; These words illustrate ancient
      mining operations.</a>

      <a name="T0002556"><b>Minister -</b> one who serves, as
      distinguished from the master. (1.) Heb. meshereth, applied
      to an attendant on one of superior rank, as to Joshua, the
      servant of Moses (Ex. 33:11), and to the servant of Elisha
      (2 Kings 4:43). This name is also given to attendants at
      court (2 Chr. 22:8), and to the priests and Levites (Jer.
      33:21; Ezek. 44:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. pelah (Ezra 7:24), a &quot;minister&quot; of
      religion. Here used of that class of sanctuary servants
      called &quot;Solomon&#39;s servants&quot; in Ezra 2:55-58
      and Neh. 7:57-60.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Greek leitourgos, a subordinate public administrator,
      and in this sense applied to magistrates (Rom. 13:6). It is
      applied also to our Lord (Heb. 8:2), and to Paul in
      relation to Christ (Rom. 15:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Greek hyperetes (literally, &quot;under-rower&quot;),
      a personal attendant on a superior, thus of the person who
      waited on the officiating priest in the synagogue (Luke
      4:20). It is applied also to John Mark, the attendant on
      Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Greek diaconos, usually a subordinate officer or
      assistant employed in relation to the ministry of the
      gospel, as to Paul and Apollos (1 Cor. 3:5), Tychicus (Eph.
      6:21), Epaphras (Col. 1:7), Timothy (1 Thess. 3:2), and
      also to Christ (Rom. 15:8).

      Ammonitish town (Judg. 11:33) from which wheat was exported
      to Tyre (Ezek. 27:17). It was probably somewhere in the
      Mishor or table-land on the east of Jordan. There is a
      gentle valley running for about 4 miles east of Dhiban
      called Kurm Dhiban, &quot;the vineyards of Dibon.&quot;
      Tristram supposes that this may be the
      &quot;vineyards&quot; mentioned in Judg. (l.c.).</a>

      flute-player. Such music was a usual accompaniment of
      funerals. In 2 Kings 3:15 it denotes a player on a stringed
      instrument.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002560"><b>Mint -</b> (Gr. heduosmon, i.e.,
      &quot;having a sweet smell&quot;), one of the garden herbs
      of which the Pharisees paid tithes (Matt. 23:23; Luke
      11:42). It belongs to the labiate family of plants. The
      species most common in Syria is the Mentha sylvestris, the
      wild mint, which grows much larger than the garden mint (M.
      sativa). It was much used in domestic economy as a
      condiment, and also as a medicine. The paying of tithes of
      mint was in accordance with the Mosiac law (Deut. 14:22),
      but the error of the Pharisees lay in their being more
      careful about this little matter of the mint than about
      weightier matters.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002561"><b>Miracle -</b> an event in the
      external world brought about by the immediate agency or the
      simple volition of God, operating without the use of means
      capable of being discerned by the senses, and designed to
      authenticate the divine commission of a religious teacher
      and the truth of his message (John 2:18; Matt. 12:38). It
      is an occurrence at once above nature and above man. It
      shows the intervention of a power that is not limited by
      the laws either of matter or of mind, a power interrupting
      the fixed laws which govern their movements, a supernatural
      power.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The suspension or violation of the laws of nature
      involved in miracles is nothing more than is constantly
      taking place around us. One force counteracts another:
      vital force keeps the chemical laws of matter in abeyance;
      and muscular force can control the action of physical
      force. When a man raises a weight from the ground, the law
      of gravity is neither suspended nor violated, but
      counteracted by a stronger force. The same is true as to
      the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming of iron
      at the command of the prophet. The simple and grand truth
      that the universe is not under the exclusive control of
      physical forces, but that everywhere and always there is
      above, separate from and superior to all else, an infinite
      personal will, not superseding, but directing and
      controlling all physical causes, acting with or without
      them.&quot; God ordinarily effects his purpose through the
      agency of second causes; but he has the power also of
      effecting his purpose immediately and without the
      intervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixed
      order, and thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm the
      possibility of miracles, the possibility of a higher hand
      intervening to control or reverse nature&#39;s ordinary
      movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament these four Greek words are principally
      used to designate miracles: (1.) Semeion, a
      &quot;sign&quot;, i.e., an evidence of a divine commission;
      an attestation of a divine message (Matt. 12:38, 39; 16:1,
      4; Mark 8:11; Luke 11:16; 23:8; John 2:11, 18, 23; Acts
      6:8, etc.); a token of the presence and working of God; the
      seal of a higher power.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Terata, &quot;wonders;&quot; wonder-causing events;
      portents; producing astonishment in the beholder (Acts
      2:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Dunameis, &quot;might works;&quot; works of superhuman
      power (Acts 2:22; Rom. 15:19; 2 Thess. 2:9); of a new and
      higher power.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Erga, &quot;works;&quot; the works of Him who is
      &quot;wonderful in working&quot; (John 5:20, 36).
    </p>
    <p>
      Miracles are seals of a divine mission. The sacred writers
      appealed to them as proofs that they were messengers of
      God. Our Lord also appealed to miracles as a conclusive
      proof of his divine mission (John 5:20, 36; 10:25, 38).
      Thus, being out of the common course of nature and beyond
      the power of man, they are fitted to convey the impression
      of the presence and power of God. Where miracles are there
      certainly God is. The man, therefore, who works a miracle
      affords thereby clear proof that he comes with the
      authority of God; they are his credentials that he is
      God&#39;s messenger. The teacher points to these
      credentials, and they are a proof that he speaks with the
      authority of God. He boldly says, &quot;God bears me
      witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers
      miracles.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The credibility of miracles is established by the evidence
      of the senses on the part of those who are witnesses of
      them, and to all others by the testimony of such witnesses.
      The witnesses were competent, and their testimony is
      trustworthy. Unbelievers, following Hume, deny that any
      testimony can prove a miracle, because they say miracles
      are impossible. We have shown that miracles are possible,
      and surely they can be borne witness to. Surely they are
      credible when we have abundant and trustworthy evidence of
      their occurrence. They are credible just as any facts of
      history well authenticated are credible. Miracles, it is
      said, are contrary to experience. Of course they are
      contrary to our experience, but that does not prove that
      they were contrary to the experience of those who witnessed
      them. We believe a thousand facts, both of history and of
      science, that are contrary to our experience, but we
      believe them on the ground of competent testimony. An
      atheist or a pantheist must, as a matter of course, deny
      the possibility of miracles; but to one who believes in a
      personal God, who in his wisdom may see fit to interfere
      with the ordinary processes of nature, miracles are not
      impossible, nor are they incredible. (See LIST OF MIRACLES,
      Appendix.)

      While David resided here he was visited by the prophet Gad,

      Samuel inaugurated the reformation that characterized his
      time by convening a great assembly of all Israel at Mizpeh,
      now the politico-religious centre of the nation. There, in
      deep humiliation on account of their sins, they renewed
      their vows and entered again into covenant with the God of
      their fathers. It was a period of great religious awakening
      and of revived national life. The Philistines heard of this
      assembly, and came up against Israel. The Hebrews charged
      the Philistine host with great fury, and they were totally
      routed. Samuel commemorated this signal victory by erecting
      a memorial-stone, which he called &quot;Ebenezer&quot;
      (q.v.), saying, &quot;Hitherto hath the Lord helped
      us&quot; (1 Sam. 7:7-12).

      Christians of Caesarea (4:36). He was an &quot;old

      3:30; 2 Sam. 8:2; Jer. 48:11, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The land of Moab (Jer. 48:24), called also the
      &quot;country of Moab&quot; (Ruth 1:2, 6; 2:6), on the east
      of Jordan and the Dead Sea, and south of the Arnon (Num.
      21:13, 26). In a wider sense it included the whole region
      that had been occupied by the Amorites. It bears the modern
      name of Kerak.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Plains of Moab, opposite Jericho (Num. 22:1; 26:63;
      Josh. 13:32), the children of Israel had their last
      encampment before they entered the land of Canaan. It was
      at that time in the possession of the Amorites (Num.
      21:22). &quot;Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto
      the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,&quot; and
      &quot;died there in the land of Moab, according to the word
      of the Lord&quot; (Deut. 34:5, 6). &quot;Surely if we had
      nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the fact
      that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height,
      this mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed
      upon the Promised Land; that it was here on Nebo, its
      loftiest mountain, that he died his solitary death; that it
      was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor, he found
      his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the
      memory in our hearts.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0002585"><b>Moabite -</b> the designation of a
      tribe descended from Moab, the son of Lot (Gen. 19:37).
      From Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern
      border of the Dead Sea, they gradually spread over the
      region on the east of Jordan. Rameses II., the Pharaoh of
      the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among his conquests.
      Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed the
      Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites (Num.
      21:26-30) out of the region between the Arnon and the
      Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital. They
      were then confined to the territory to the south of the
      Arnon.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On their journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab,
      but through the &quot;wilderness&quot; to the east (Deut.
      2:8; Judg. 11:18), at length reaching the country to the
      north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till
      they had conquered Bashan (see SIHON &macr;T0003427; OG
      &macr;T0002771). The Moabites were alarmed, and their king,
      Balak, sought aid from the Midianites (Num. 22:2-4). It was
      while they were here that the visit of Balaam (q.v.) to
      Balak took place. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002600.html&amp;from=T0002602&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      MOSES</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile
      relations with the Israelites, and frequently harassed them
      in war (Judg. 3:12-30; 1 Sam. 14). The story of Ruth,
      however, shows the existence of friendly relations between
      Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be
      said to have had Moabite blood in his veins. Yet there was
      war between David and the Moabites (2 Sam. 8:2; 23:20; 1
      Chr. 18:2), from whom he took great spoil (2 Sam. 8:2, 11,
      12; 1 Chr. 11:22; 18:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      During the one hundred and fifty years which followed the
      defeat of the Moabites, after the death of Ahab (see MESHA
      &macr;T0002505), they regained, apparently, much of their
      former prosperty. At this time Isaiah (15:1) delivered his
      &quot;burden of Moab,&quot; predicting the coming of
      judgment on that land (comp. 2 Kings 17:3; 18:9; 1 Chr.
      5:25, 26). Between the time of Isaiah and the commencement
      of the Babylonian captivity we have very seldom any
      reference to Moab (Jer. 25:21; 27:3; 40:11; Zeph. 2:8-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Return, it was Sanballat, a Moabite, who took
      chief part in seeking to prevent the rebuilding of
      Jerusalem (Neh. 2:19; 4:1; 6:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002586"><b>Moabite Stone -</b> a basalt stone,
      bearing an inscription by King Mesha, which was discovered
      at Dibon by Klein, a German missionary at Jerusalem, in
      1868. It was 3 1/2 feet high and 2 in breadth and in
      thickness, rounded at the top. It consisted of thirty-four
      lines, written in Hebrew-Phoenician characters. It was set
      up by Mesha as a record and memorial of his victories. It
      records (1) Mesha&#39;s wars with Omri, (2) his public
      buildings, and (3) his wars against Horonaim. This
      inscription in a remarkable degree supplements and
      corroborates the history of King Mesha recorded in 2 Kings
      3:4-27.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of a very few variations, the Moabite
      language in which the inscription is written is identical
      with the Hebrew. The form of the letters here used supplies
      very important and interesting information regarding the
      history of the formation of the alphabet, as well as,
      incidentally, regarding the arts of civilized life of those
      times in the land of Moab.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ancient monument, recording the heroic struggles of
      King Mesha with Omri and Ahab, was erected about B.C. 900.
      Here &quot;we have the identical slab on which the workmen
      of the old world carved the history of their own times, and
      from which the eye of their contemporaries read thousands
      of years ago the record of events of which they themselves
      had been the witnesses.&quot; It is the oldest inscription
      written in alphabetic characters, and hence is, apart from
      its value in the domain of Hebrew antiquities, of great
      linguistic importance.

      south of Judah which fell to Simeon (Josh. 15:21-26; 19:2).

      east of Beersheba.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002588"><b>Mole -</b> Heb. tinshameth (Lev.
      11:30), probably signifies some species of lizard (rendered
      in R.V., &quot;chameleon&quot;). In Lev. 11:18, Deut.
      14:16, it is rendered, in Authorized Version,
      &quot;swan&quot; (R.V., &quot;horned owl&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Heb. holed (Lev. 11:29), rendered &quot;weasel,&quot;
      was probably the mole-rat. The true mole (Talpa Europoea)
      is not found in Palestine. The mole-rat (Spalax typhlus)
      &quot;is twice the size of our mole, with no external eyes,
      and with only faint traces within of the rudimentary organ;
      no apparent ears, but, like the mole, with great internal
      organs of hearing; a strong, bare snout, and with large
      gnawing teeth; its colour a pale slate; its feet short, and
      provided with strong nails; its tail only
      rudimentary.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In Isa. 2:20, this word is the rendering of two words
      _haphar peroth_, which are rendered by Gesenius &quot;into
      the digging of rats&quot;, i.e., rats&#39; holes. But these
      two Hebrew words ought probably to be combined into one
      (lahporperoth) and translated &quot;to the moles&quot;,
      i.e., the rat-moles. This animal &quot;lives in underground
      communities, making large subterranean chambers for its
      young and for storehouses, with many runs connected with
      them, and is decidedly partial to the loose debris among
      ruins and stone-heaps, where it can form its chambers with
      least trouble.&quot;

      <a name="T0002589"><b>Moloch -</b> king, the name of the
      national god of the Ammonites, to whom children were
      sacrificed by fire. He was the consuming and destroying and
      also at the same time the purifying fire. In Amos 5:26,
      &quot;your Moloch&quot; of the Authorized Version is
      &quot;your king&quot; in the Revised Version (comp. Acts
      7:43). Solomon (1 Kings 11:7) erected a high place for this
      idol on the Mount of Olives, and from that time till the
      days of Josiah his worship continued (2 Kings 23:10, 13).
      In the days of Jehoahaz it was partially restored, but
      after the Captivity wholly disappeared. He is also called
      Molech (Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5, etc.), Milcom (1 Kings 11:5,
      33, etc.), and Malcham (Zeph. 1:5). This god became Chemosh
      among the Moabites.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0002590"><b>Money -</b> Of uncoined money the
      first notice we have is in the history of Abraham (Gen.
      13:2; 20:16; 24:35). Next, this word is used in connection
      with the purchase of the cave of Machpelah (23:16), and
      again in connection with Jacob&#39;s purchase of a field at
      Shalem (Gen. 33:18, 19) for &quot;an hundred pieces of
      money&quot;=an hundred Hebrew kesitahs (q.v.), i.e.,
      probably pieces of money, as is supposed, bearing the
      figure of a lamb.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Joseph affords evidence of the constant use
      of money, silver of a fixed weight. This appears also in
      all the subsequent history of the Jewish people, in all
      their internal as well as foreign transactions. There were
      in common use in trade silver pieces of a definite weight,
      shekels, half-shekels, and quarter-shekels. But these were
      not properly coins, which are pieces of metal
      authoritatively issued, and bearing a stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the use of coined money we have no early notice among
      the Hebrews. The first mentioned is of Persian coinage, the
      daric (Ezra 2:69; Neh. 7:70) and the &#39;adarkon (Ezra
      8:27). The daric (q.v.) was a gold piece current in
      Palestine in the time of Cyrus. As long as the Jews, after
      the Exile, lived under Persian rule, they used Persian
      coins. These gave place to Greek coins when Palestine came
      under the dominion of the Greeks (B.C. 331), the coins
      consisting of gold, silver, and copper pieces. The usual
      gold pieces were staters (q.v.), and the silver coins
      tetradrachms and drachms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year B.C. 140, Antiochus VII. gave permission to
      Simon the Maccabee to coin Jewish money. Shekels (q.v.)
      were then coined bearing the figure of the almond rod and
      the pot of manna.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002591"><b>Money-changer -</b> (Matt. 21:12;
      Mark 11:15; John 2:15). Every Israelite from twenty years
      and upwards had to pay (Ex. 30:13-15) into the sacred
      treasury half a shekel every year as an offering to
      Jehovah, and that in the exact Hebrew half-shekel piece.
      There was a class of men, who frequented the temple courts,
      who exchanged at a certain premium foreign moneys for these
      half-shekels to the Jews who came up to Jerusalem from all
      parts of the world. (See <a href=

      the temple, these money-changers fared worst. Their tables
      were overturned and they themselves were expelled.</a>

      <a name="T0002592"><b>Month -</b> Among the Egyptians the
      month of thirty days each was in use long before the time
      of the Exodus, and formed the basis of their calculations.
      From the time of the institution of the Mosaic law the
      month among the Jews was lunar. The cycle of religious
      feasts depended on the moon. The commencement of a month
      was determined by the observation of the new moon. The
      number of months in the year was usually twelve (1 Kings
      4:7; 1 Chr. 27:1-15); but every third year an additional
      month (ve-Adar) was inserted, so as to make the months
      coincide with the seasons.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The Hebrews and Phoenicians had no word for month
      save &#39;moon,&#39; and only saved their calendar from
      becoming vague like that of the Moslems by the
      interpolation of an additional month. There is no evidence
      at all that they ever used a true solar year such as the
      Egyptians possessed. The latter had twelve months of thirty
      days and five epagomenac or odd days.&quot;, Palestine
      Quarterly, January 1889.

      <a name="T0002593"><b>Moon -</b> heb. yareah, from its
      paleness (Ezra 6:15), and lebanah, the &quot;white&quot;
      (Cant. 6:10; Isa. 24:23), was appointed by the Creator to
      be with the sun &quot;for signs, and for seasons, and for
      days, and years&quot; (Gen. 1:14-16). A lunation was among
      the Jews the period of a month, and several of their
      festivals were held on the day of the new moon. It is
      frequently referred to along with the sun (Josh. 10:12; Ps.
      72:5, 7, 17; 89:36, 37; Eccl. 12:2; Isa. 24:23, etc.), and
      also by itself (Ps. 8:3; 121:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The great brilliance of the moon in Eastern countries led
      to its being early an object of idolatrous worship (Deut.
      4:19; 17:3; Job 31:26), a form of idolatry against which
      the Jews were warned (Deut. 4:19; 17:3). They, however,
      fell into this idolatry, and offered incense (2 Kings 23:5;
      Jer. 8:2), and also cakes of honey, to the moon (Jer. 7:18;
      44:17-19, 25).

      <a name="T0002594"><b>Mordecai -</b> the son of Jair, of
      the tribe of Benjamin. It has been alleged that he was
      carried into captivity with Jeconiah, and hence that he
      must have been at least one hundred and twenty-nine years
      old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the
      words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion.
      It was probably Kish of whom it is said (ver. 6) that he
      &quot;had been carried away with the captivity.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He resided at Susa, the metropolis of Persia. He adopted
      his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan child, whom he
      tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was
      brought into the king&#39;s harem and made queen in the
      room of the deposed queen Vashti, he was promoted to some
      office in the court of Ahasuerus, and was one of those who
      &quot;sat in the king&#39;s gate&quot; (Esther 2:21). While
      holding this office, he discovered a plot of the eunuchs to
      put the king to death, which, by his vigilance, was
      defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly
      recorded in the royal chronicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the highest
      position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him;
      and Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of
      Mordecai, resolved to accomplish his death in a wholesale
      destruction of the Jewish exiles throughout the Persian
      empire (Esther 3:8-15). Tidings of this cruel scheme soon
      reached the ears of Mordecai, who communicated with Queen
      Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold intervention
      the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from
      destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman
      was executed on the gallows he had by anticipation erected
      for Mordecai (6:2-7:10). In memory of the signal
      deliverance thus wrought for them, the Jews to this day
      celebrate the feast (9:26-32) of Purim (q.v.).

      Mortar for pulverizing (Prov. 27:22) grain or other
      substances by means of a pestle instead of a mill. Mortars
      were used in the wilderness for pounding the manna (Num.
      11:8). It is commonly used in Palestine at the present day
      to pound wheat, from which the Arabs make a favourite dish
      called kibby.
