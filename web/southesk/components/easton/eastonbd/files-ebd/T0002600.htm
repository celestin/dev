      <a name="T0002600"><b>Mosera -</b> a bond, one of the
      stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (Deut. 10:6),
      at the foot of Mount Hor. (Comp. Num. 33:37, 38). It has
      been identified with el-Tayibeh, a small fountain at the
      bottom of the pass leading to the ascent of Mount Hor.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002601"><b>Moseroth -</b> bonds, one of the
      stations in the wilderness (Num. 33:30, 31), probably the
      same as Mosera.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002602"><b>Moses -</b> drawn (or Egypt. mesu,
      &quot;son;&quot; hence Rameses, royal son). On the
      invitation of Pharaoh (Gen. 45:17-25), Jacob and his sons
      went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably
      about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries
      before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral
      Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel
      subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race.
      Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd&#39;s
      life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with
      favour by the king, who assigned them the &quot;best of the
      land&quot;, the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or
      &quot;shepherd&quot; king who thus showed favour to Joseph
      and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or
      Apopis).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus favoured, the Israelites began to &quot;multiply
      exceedingly&quot; (Gen. 47:27), and extended to the west
      and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an
      end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their
      possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of
      Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians
      began to despise them, and the period of their
      &quot;affliction&quot; (Gen. 15:13) commenced. They were
      sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in
      numbers, and &quot;the land was filled with them&quot; (Ex.
      1:7). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so
      that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In process of time &quot;a king [probably Seti I.] arose
      who knew not Joseph&quot; (Ex. 1:8). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002900.html&amp;from=T0002923&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      PHARAOH</a>.) The circumstances of the country were such
      that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite
      subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their
      number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were
      employed in connection with his numerous buildings,
      especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and
      palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with
      rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and
      &quot;all their service, wherein they made them serve, was
      with rigour&quot; (Ex. 1:13, 14). But this cruel oppression
      had not the result expected of reducing their number. On
      the contrary, &quot;the more the Egyptians afflicted them,
      the more they multiplied and grew&quot; (Ex. 1:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with
      the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of
      all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the
      king&#39;s wish was not rigorously enforced; the male
      children were spared by the midwives, so that &quot;the
      people multiplied&quot; more than ever. Thus baffled, the
      king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to
      put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them
      into the river (Ex. 1:22). But neither by this edict was
      the king&#39;s purpose effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of
      the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the
      family of the Kohathites (Ex. 6:16-20), who with his wife
      Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps
      fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years,
      resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time.
      In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His
      mother concealed him in the house for three months from the
      knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of
      concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring
      her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by
      constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid
      among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the
      spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe.
      Her plan was successful. The king&#39;s daughter &quot;saw
      the child; and behold the child wept.&quot; The princess
      (see PHARAOH&#39;S DAUGHTER &macr;T0002924 [1]) sent
      Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and
      brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said,
      &quot;Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will
      give thee thy wages.&quot; Thus Jochebed&#39;s child, whom
      the princess called &quot;Moses&quot;, i.e., &quot;Saved
      from the water&quot; (Ex. 2:10), was ultimately restored to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come,
      he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to
      the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted
      son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him
      and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur
      and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however,
      probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was
      of the highest importance as to his religious belief and
      his interest in his &quot;brethren.&quot; His education
      would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would
      enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body
      and his mind. He at length became &quot;learned in all the
      wisdom of the Egyptians&quot; (Acts 7:22). Egypt had then
      two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of
      which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was
      completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age,
      spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in
      Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in
      military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus
      that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between
      Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful
      general, and became &quot;mighty in deeds&quot; (Acts
      7:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses
      returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably
      have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with
      wealth. But &quot;beneath the smooth current of his life
      hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and
      comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of
      his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to
      youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent,
      perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian
      surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to
      forget, that he was a Hebrew.&quot; He now resolved to make
      himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen,
      and &quot;went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their
      burdens&quot; (Ex. 2:11). This tour of inspection revealed
      to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they
      everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the
      serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time
      had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he
      might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made
      his choice accordingly (Heb. 11:25-27), assured that God
      would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people.
      He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode,
      probably in his father&#39;s house, as one of the Hebrew
      people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong
      at the hands of the Egyptians.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not remain indifferent to the state of things
      around him, and going out one day among the people, his
      indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was
      maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew
      the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he
      went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He
      speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known.
      It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the &quot;great
      Rameses,&quot; Rameses II.), who &quot;sought to slay
      Moses&quot; (Ex. 2:15). Moved by fear, Moses fled from
      Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the
      southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much
      the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he
      led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to
      find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained
      for forty years (Acts 7:30), under training unconsciously
      for his great life&#39;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the
      burning bush (Ex. 3), and commissioned him to go down to
      Egypt and &quot;bring forth the children of Israel&quot;
      out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at
      length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the
      land of Midian (4:18-26). On the way he was met by Aaron
      (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a
      hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch.
      7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See <a
      href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001200.html&amp;from=T0001283&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      EXODUS</a>.) After an eventful journey to and fro in the
      wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of
      Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised
      Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders (Deut.
      1:1-4; 5:1-26:19; 27:11-30:20), and gives the people his
      last counsels, and then rehearses the great song (Deut.
      32), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his
      heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous
      history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a
      part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to
      &quot;the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah,
      that is over against Jericho&quot; (34:1), and from thence
      he surveys the land. &quot;Jehovah shewed him all the land
      of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of
      Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the
      utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of
      Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar&quot; (Deut.
      34:2-3), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom
      he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being
      one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of
      the Lord, and was buried by the Lord &quot;in a valley in
      the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor&quot; (34:6). The
      people mourned for him during thirty days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus died &quot;Moses the man of God&quot; (Deut. 33:1;
      Josh. 14:6). He was distinguished for his meekness and
      patience and firmness, and &quot;he endured as seeing him
      who is invisible.&quot; &quot;There arose not a prophet
      since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to
      face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent
      him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his
      servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand,
      and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight
      of all Israel&quot; (Deut. 34:10-12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and
      Prophets as the chief of the prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament he is referred to as the
      representative of the law and as a type of Christ (John
      1:17; 2 Cor. 3:13-18; Heb. 3:5, 6). Moses is the only
      character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens
      himself (John 5:46; comp. Deut. 18:15, 18, 19; Acts 7:37).
      In Heb. 3:1-19 this likeness to Moses is set forth in
      various particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Jude 1:9 mention is made of a contention between Michael
      and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is
      supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the
      body of Moses so as to prevent idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002603"><b>Mote -</b> (Gr. karphos, something
      dry, hence a particle of wood or chaff, etc.). A slight
      moral defect is likened to a mote (Matt. 7:3-5; Luke 6:41,
      42).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002604"><b>Moth -</b> Heb. &#39;ash, from a root
      meaning &quot;to fall away,&quot; as moth-eaten garments
      fall to pieces (Job 4:19; 13:28; Isa. 50:9; 51:8; Hos.
      5:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gr. ses, thus rendered in Matt. 6:19, 20; Luke 12:33.
      Allusion is thus made to the destruction of clothing by the
      larvae of the clothes-moth. This is the only lepidopterous
      insect referred to in Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002605"><b>Mouldy -</b> Of the Gibeonites it is
      said that &quot;all the bread of their provision was dry
      and mouldy&quot; (Josh. 9:5, 12). The Hebrew word here
      rendered &quot;mouldy&quot; (nikuddim) is rendered
      &quot;cracknels&quot; in 1 Kings 14:3, and denotes a kind
      of crisp cake. The meaning is that the bread of the
      Gibeonites had become dry and hard, hard as biscuits, and
      thus was an evidence of the length of the journey they had
      travelled.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002606"><b>Mount -</b> Palestine is a hilly
      country (Deut. 3:25; 11:11; Ezek. 34:13). West of Jordan
      the mountains stretch from Lebanon far down into Galilee,
      terminating in Carmel. The isolated peak of Tabor rises
      from the elevated plain of Esdraelon, which, in the south,
      is shut in by hills spreading over the greater part of
      Samaria. The mountains of Western and Middle Palestine do
      not extend to the sea, but gently slope into plains, and
      toward the Jordan fall down into the Ghor.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      East of the Jordan the Anti-Lebanon, stretching south,
      terminates in the hilly district called Jebel Heish, which
      reaches down to the Sea of Gennesareth. South of the river
      Hieromax there is again a succession of hills, which are
      traversed by wadies running toward the Jordan. These
      gradually descend to a level at the river Arnon, which was
      the boundary of the ancient trans-Jordanic territory toward
      the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      The composition of the Palestinian hills is limestone, with
      occasional strata of chalk, and hence the numerous caves,
      some of large extent, found there.

      in the far north, and in Babylonian inscriptions is
      described as a mountain called Im-Kharasak, &quot;the
      mighty mountain of Bel, whose head reaches heaven, whose

      11); in many of the psalms (51, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mourning was expressed, (1) by weeping (Gen. 35:8, marg.;
      Luke 7:38, etc.); (2) by loud lamentation (Ruth 1:9; 1 Sam.
      6:19; 2 Sam. 3:31); (3) by the disfigurement of the person,
      as rending the clothes (Gen. 37:29, 34; Matt. 26:65),
      wearing sackcloth (Gen. 37:34; Ps. 35:13), sprinkling dust
      or ashes on the person (2 Sam. 13:19; Jer. 6:26; Job 2:12),
      shaving the head and plucking out the hair of the head or
      beard (Lev. 10:6; Job 1:20), neglect of the person or the
      removal of ornaments (Ex. 33:4; Deut. 21:12, 13; 2 Sam.
      14:2; 19:24; Matt. 6:16, 17), fasting (2 Sam. 1:12),
      covering the upper lip (Lev. 13:45; Micah 3:7), cutting the
      flesh (Jer. 16:6, 7), and sitting in silence (Judg. 20:26;
      2 Sam. 12:16; 13:31; Job 1:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the later times we find a class of mourners who could be
      hired to give by their loud lamentation the external tokens
      of sorrow (2 Chr. 35:25; Jer. 9:17; Matt. 9:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of mourning for the dead varied. For Jacob it
      was seventy days (Gen. 50:3); for Aaron (Num. 20:29) and
      Moses (Deut. 34:8) thirty days; and for Saul only seven
      days (1 Sam. 31:13). In 2 Sam. 3:31-35, we have a
      description of the great mourning for the death of Abner.

      field-mouse (1 Sam. 6:4). In Lev. 11:29, Isa. 66:17 this
      word is used generically, and includes the jerboa (Mus
      jaculus), rat, hamster (Cricetus), which, though declared
      to be unclean animals, were eaten by the Arabs, and are
      still eaten by the Bedouins. It is said that no fewer than
      twenty-three species of this group (&#39;akhbar=Arab.
      ferah) of animals inhabit Palestine. God &quot;laid
      waste&quot; the people of Ashdod by the terrible visitation
      of field-mice, which are like locusts in their destructive
      effects (1 Sam. 6:4, 11, 18). Herodotus, the Greek
      historian, accounts for the destruction of the army of
      Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:35) by saying that in the night
      thousands of mice invaded the camp and gnawed through the
      bow-strings, quivers, and shields, and thus left the
      Assyrians helpless. (See <a href=

      &quot;weeping&quot;) in Ps. 84:6. The plural form of the
      Hebrew bekaim is rendered &quot;mulberry trees&quot; in 2
      Sam. 5:23, 24 and 1 Chr. 14:14, 15. The tree here alluded
      to was probably the aspen or trembling poplar. &quot;We
      know with certainty that the black poplar, the aspen, and
      the Lombardy poplar grew in Palestine. The aspen, whose
      long leaf-stalks cause the leaves to tremble with every
      breath of wind, unites with the willow and the oak to
      overshadow the watercourses of the Lebanon, and with the
      oleander and the acacia to adorn the ravines of Southern
      Palestine&quot; (Kitto). By &quot;the sound of a going in
      the tops of the mulberry trees&quot; we are to understand a
      rustling among the trees like the marching of an army. This
      was the signal that the Lord himself would lead forth

      <a name="T0002620"><b>Mule -</b> (Heb. pered), so called
      from the quick step of the animal or its power of carrying
      loads. It is not probable that the Hebrews bred mules, as
      this was strictly forbidden in the law (Lev. 19:19),
      although their use was not forbidden. We find them in
      common use even by kings and nobles (2 Sam. 18:9; 1 Kings
      1:33; 2 Kings 5:17; Ps. 32:9). They are not mentioned,
      however, till the time of David, for the word rendered
      &quot;mules&quot; (R.V. correctly, &quot;hot springs&quot;)
      in Gen. 36:24 (yemim) properly denotes the warm springs of
      Callirhoe, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In
      David&#39;s reign they became very common (2 Sam. 13:29; 1
      Kings 10:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mules are not mentioned in the New Testament. Perhaps they
      had by that time ceased to be used in Palestine.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002621"><b>Murder -</b> Wilful murder was
      distinguished from accidental homicide, and was invariably
      visited with capital punishment (Num. 35:16, 18, 21, 31;
      Lev. 24:17). This law in its principle is founded on the
      fact of man&#39;s having been made in the likeness of God
      (Gen. 9:5, 6; John 8:44; 1 John 3:12, 15). The Mosiac law
      prohibited any compensation for murder or the reprieve of
      the murderer (Ex. 21:12, 14; Deut. 19:11, 13; 2 Sam. 17:25;
      20:10). Two witnesses were required in any capital case
      (Num. 35:19-30; Deut. 17:6-12). If the murderer could not
      be discovered, the city nearest the scene of the murder was
      required to make expiation for the crime committed (Deut.
      21:1-9). These offences also were to be punished with
      death, (1) striking a parent; (2) cursing a parent; (3)
      kidnapping (Ex. 21:15-17; Deut. 27:16).</a>

      only averted by the earnest prayer of Moses (Num. 11:33,
      34; 12; 14:27, 30, 31; 16:3; 21:4-6; Ps. 106:25). Forbidden

      &quot;destruction,&quot; a &quot;great mortality&quot;, the
      fifth plague that fell upon the Egyptians (Ex. 9:3). It was
      some distemper that resulted in the sudden and widespread
      death of the cattle. It was confined to the cattle of the
      Egyptians that were in the field (9:6).</a>

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002625"><b>Music -</b> Jubal was the inventor of
      musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The Hebrews were much
      given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and
      literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the
      Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of
      Laban&#39;s interview with Jacob (Gen. 31:27). After their
      triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of
      Israel sang their song of deliverance (Ex. 15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden
      age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was
      now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an
      essential part of training in the schools of the prophets
      (1 Sam. 10:5; 19:19-24; 2 Kings 3:15; 1 Chr. 25:6). There
      now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam.
      19:35; Eccl. 2:8). The temple, however, was the great
      school of music. In the conducting of its services large
      bands of trained singers and players on instruments were
      constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15; 16; 23;5;
      25:1-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      In private life also music seems to have held an important
      place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4-6; Isa. 5:11,
      12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).

      menatstseah), the precentor of the Levitical choir or
      orchestra in the temple, mentioned in the titles of
      fifty-five psalms, and in Hab. 3:19, Revised Version. The
      first who held this office was Jeduthun (1 Chr. 16:41), and
      the office appears to have been hereditary. Heman and Asaph
      were his two colleagues (2 Chr. 35:15).</a>

      <a name="T0002627"><b>Music, Instrumental -</b> Among
      instruments of music used by the Hebrews a principal place
      is given to stringed instruments. These were, (1.) The
      kinnor, the &quot;harp.&quot; (2.) The nebel, &quot;a skin
      bottle,&quot; rendered &quot;psaltery.&quot; (3.) The
      sabbeka, or &quot;sackbut,&quot; a lute or lyre. (4.) The
      gittith, occurring in the title of Ps. 8; 8; 84. (5.)
      Minnim (Ps. 150:4), rendered &quot;stringed
      instruments;&quot; in Ps. 45:8, in the form <i>minni</i>,
      probably the apocopated (i.e., shortened) plural, rendered,
      Authorized Version, &quot;whereby,&quot; and in the Revised
      Version &quot;stringed instruments.&quot; (6.) Machalath,
      in the titles of Ps. 53 and 88; supposed to be a kind of
      lute or guitar.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of wind instruments mention is made of, (1.) The &#39;ugab
      (Gen. 4:21; Job 21:12; 30:31), probably the so-called
      Pan&#39;s pipes or syrinx. (2.) The qeren or
      &quot;horn&quot; (Josh. 6:5; 1 Chr. 25:5). (3.) The
      shophar, rendered &quot;trumpet&quot; (Josh. 6:4, 6, 8).
      The word means &quot;bright,&quot; and may have been so
      called from the clear, shrill sound it emitted. It was
      often used (Ex. 19:13; Num. 10:10; Judg. 7:16, 18; 1 Sam.
      13:3). (4.) The hatsotserah, or straight trumpet (Ps. 98:6;
      Num. 10:1-10). This name is supposed by some to be an
      onomatopoetic word, intended to imitate the pulse-like
      sound of the trumpet, like the Latin taratantara. Some have
      identified it with the modern trombone. (5.) The halil,
      i.e, &quot;bored through,&quot; a flute or pipe (1 Sam.
      10:5; 1 Kings 1:40; Isa. 5:12; Jer. 48:36) which is still
      used in Palestine. (6.) The sumponyah, rendered
      &quot;dulcimer&quot; (Dan. 3:5), probably a sort of
      bagpipe. (7.) The maskrokith&#39;a (Dan. 3:5), rendered
      &quot;flute,&quot; but its precise nature is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of instruments of percussion mention is made of, (1.) The
      toph, an instrument of the drum kind, rendered
      &quot;timbrel&quot; (Ex. 15:20; Job 21:12; Ps. 68:25); also
      &quot;tabret&quot; (Gen. 31:27; Isa. 24:8; 1 Sam. 10:5).
      (2.) The paamon, the &quot;bells&quot; on the robe of the
      high priest (Ex. 28:33; 39:25). (3.) The tseltselim,
      &quot;cymbals&quot; (2 Sam. 6:5; Ps. 150:5), which are
      struck together and produce a loud, clanging sound.
      Metsilloth, &quot;bells&quot; on horses and camels for
      ornament, and metsiltayim, &quot;cymbals&quot; (1 Chr.
      13:8; Ezra 3:10, etc.). These words are all derived from
      the same root, tsalal, meaning &quot;to tinkle.&quot; (4.)
      The menaan&#39;im, used only in 2 Sam. 6:5, rendered
      &quot;cornets&quot; (R.V., &quot;castanets&quot;); in the
      Vulgate, &quot;sistra,&quot; an instrument of agitation.
      (5.) The shalishim, mentioned only in 1 Sam. 18:6, rendered
      &quot;instruments of music&quot; (marg. of R.V.,
      &quot;triangles or three-stringed instruments&quot;).

      The words in Eccl. 2:8, &quot;musical instruments, and that

      It has been thought to be the chestnut, mastich, stacte,

      the commander of the armies of Benhadad II. in the time of
      Joram, king of Israel. He was afflicted with leprosy; and
      when the little Hebrew slave-girl that waited on his wife
      told her of a prophet in Samaria who could cure her master,
      he obtained a letter from Benhadad and proceeded with it to
      Joram. The king of Israel suspected in this some evil
      design against him, and rent his clothes. Elisha the
      prophet hearing of this, sent for Naaman, and the strange
      interview which took place is recorded in 2 Kings 5. The

      Caleb who dwelt at Maon (1 Sam. 25), the modern Main, 7
      miles south-east of Hebron. He was &quot;very great, and he
      had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats...but the man was churlish
      and evil in his doings.&quot; During his wanderings David
      came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about
      to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask
      &quot;whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy
      servants.&quot; Nabal insultingly resented the demand,
      saying, &quot;Who is David, and who is the son of
      Jesse?&quot; (1 Sam. 25:10, 11). One of the shepherds that
      stood by and saw the reception David&#39;s messengers had
      met with, informed Abigail, Nabal&#39;s wife, who at once
      realized the danger that threatened her household. She
      forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her
      ample stores of provisions (25:18). She so courteously and
      persuasively pled her cause that David&#39;s anger was
      appeased, and he said to her, &quot;Blessed be the Lord God
      of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On her return she found her husband incapable from
      drunkenness of understanding the state of matters, and not
      till the following day did she explain to him what had
      happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which
      his conduct had exposed him. &quot;His heart died within
      him, and he became as a stone.&quot; and about ten days
      after &quot;the Lord smote Nabal that he died&quot; (1 Sam.
      25:37, 38). Not long after David married Abigail (q.v.).

      <a name="T0002645"><b>Naboth -</b> fruits, &quot;the
      Jezreelite,&quot; was the owner of a portion of ground on
      the eastern slope of the hill of Jezreel (2 Kings 9:25,
      26). This small &quot;plat of ground&quot; seems to have
      been all he possessed. It was a vineyard, and lay
      &quot;hard by the palace of Ahab&quot; (1 Kings 21:1, 2),
      who greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any
      terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from
      his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his
      property (Lev. 25:23). Jezebel, Ahab&#39;s wife, was
      grievously offended at Naboth&#39;s refusal to part with
      his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his
      death. His sons also shared his fate (2 Kings 9:26; 1 Kings
      21:19). She then came to Ahab and said, &quot;Arise, take
      possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but
      dead.&quot; Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which
      had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly
      enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly
      appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful
      doom (1 Kings 21:17-24). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at
      this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted
      on Jehu&#39;s memory that many years afterwards he refers
      to them (2 Kings 9:26), and he was the chief instrument in
      inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their
      house (9:30-37). The house of Ahab was extinguished by him.
      Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and his
      priests did Jehu spare (10:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahab humbled himself at Elijah&#39;s words (1 Kings 21:28,
      29), and therefore the prophecy was fulfilled not in his
      fate but in that of his son Joram (2 Kings 9:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Naboth, compared with that of Ahab and
      Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of
      a retributive providence, a law which runs through all
      history (comp. Ps. 109:17, 18).

      siege to Gibbethon, a town of southern Dan (Josh. 19:44), a
      conspiracy broke out in his army, and he was slain by
      Baasha (1 Kings 15:25-28), after a reign of two years (B.C.
      955-953). The assassination of Nadab was followed by that
      of his whole house, and thus this great Ephraimite family

      Jabesh-Gilead having been exposed to great danger from
      Nahash, sent messengers to Gibeah to inform Saul of their
      extremity. He promptly responded to the call, and gathering
      together an army he marched against Nahash. &quot;And it
      came to pass that they which remained were scattered, so
      that two of them [the Ammonites] were not left
      together&quot; (1 Sam. 11:1-11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another king of the Ammonites of the same name is
      mentioned, who showed kindness to David during his
      wanderings (2 Sam. 10:2). On his death David sent an
      embassy of sympathy to Hanun, his son and successor, at
      Rabbah Ammon, his capital. The grievous insult which was
      put upon these ambassadors led to a war against the
      Ammonites, who, with their allies the Syrians, were
      completely routed in a battle fought at &quot;the entering
      in of the gate,&quot; probably of Medeba (2 Sam. 10:6-14).
      Again Hadarezer rallied the Syrian host, which was totally
      destroyed by the Israelite army under Joab in a decisive
      battle fought at Helam (2 Sam. 10:17), near to Hamath (1
      Chr. 18:3). &quot;So the Syrians feared to help the
      children of Ammon any more&quot; (2 Sam. 10:19).

      (3.) The father of Amasa, who was commander-in-chief of
      Abasolom&#39;s army (2 Sam. 17:25). Jesse&#39;s wife had
      apparently been first married to this man, to whom she bore
      Abigail and Zeruiah, who were thus David&#39;s sisters, but
      only on the mother&#39;s side (1 Chr. 2:16).

      daughter of his brother Haran, and remained in the land of
      his nativity on the east of the river Euphrates at Haran
      (Gen. 11:27-32). A correspondence was maintained between
      the family of Abraham in Canaan and the relatives in the
      old ancestral home at Haran till the time of Jacob. When
      Jacob fled from Haran all intercourse between the two
      branches of the family came to an end (Gen. 31:55). His
      grand-daughter Rebekah became Isaac&#39;s wife (24:67).

      of him is recorded in the book of his prophecies. He was
      probably a native of Galilee, and after the deportation of
      the ten tribes took up his residence in Jerusalem. Others
      think that Elkosh was the name of a place on the east bank
      of the Tigris, and that Nahum dwelt there.</a>

      prophesied, according to some, in the beginning of the

      prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the
      reign of Hezekiah (about B.C. 709). This is the more
      probable opinion, internal evidences leading to that
      conclusion. Probably the book was written in Jerusalem
      (soon after B.C. 709), where he witnessed the invasion of
      Sennacherib and the destruction of his host (2 Kings
      19:35).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of this prophecy is the approaching complete
      and final destruction of Nineveh, the capital of the great
      and at that time flourishing Assyrian empire.
      Assur-bani-pal was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was
      a city of vast extent, and was then the centre of the
      civilzation and commerce of the world, a &quot;bloody city
      all full of lies and robbery&quot; (Nah. 3:1), for it had
      robbed and plundered all the neighbouring nations. It was
      strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every
      enemy; yet it was to be utterly destroyed as a punishment
      for the great wickedness of its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonah had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum
      was followed by Zephaniah, who also predicted (Zeph.
      2:4-15) the destruction of the city, predictions which were
      remarkably fulfilled (B.C. 625) when Nineveh was destroyed
      apparently by fire, and the Assyrian empire came to an end,
      an event which changed the face of Asia. (See <a href=

      (Ezek. 15:3), more especially a tent-peg (Ex. 27:19; 35:18;
      38:20), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced the temples
      of Sisera (Judg. 4:21, 22). This word is also used
      metaphorically (Zech. 10:4) for a prince or counsellor,
      just as &quot;the battle-bow&quot; represents a
      warrior.</a>

      (2.) Masmer, a &quot;point,&quot; the usual word for a
      nail. The words of the wise are compared to &quot;nails
      fastened by the masters of assemblies&quot; (Eccl. 12:11,
      A.V.). The Revised Version reads, &quot;as nails well
      fastened are the words of the masters,&quot; etc. Others
      (as Plumptre) read, &quot;as nails fastened are the masters
      of assemblies&quot; (comp. Isa. 22:23; Ezra 9:8). David
      prepared nails for the temple (1 Chr. 22:3; 2 Chr. 3:9).
      The nails by which our Lord was fixed to the cross are
      mentioned (John 20:25; Col. 2:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nail of the finger (Heb. tsipporen, &quot;scraping&quot;).
      To &quot;pare the nails&quot; is in Deut. 21:12 (marg.,
      &quot;make,&quot; or &quot;dress,&quot; or &quot;suffer to
      grow&quot;) one of the signs of purification, separation
      from former heathenism (comp. Lev. 14:8; Num. 8:7). In Jer.

      of a town near the gate of which Jesus raised to life a
      widow&#39;s son (Luke 7:11-17). It is identified with the
      village called Nein, standing on the north-western slope of
      Jebel ed-Duhy (=the &quot;hill Moreh&quot; = &quot;Little
      hermon&quot;), about 4 miles from Tabor and 25 southwest of
      Capernaum. At the foot of the slope on which it stands is
      the great plain of Esdraelon.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first miracle of raising the dead our Lord had

      given to the prophetical college established by Samuel near
      Ramah. It consisted of a cluster of separate dwellings, and
      hence its name. David took refuge here when he fled from
      Saul (1 Sam. 19:18, 19, 22, 23), and here he passed a few
      weeks in peace (comp. Ps. 11). It was probably the common
      residence of the &quot;sons of the prophets.&quot;</a>

      absolute nakedness (Gen. 2:25; Job 1:21; Eccl. 5:15; Micah
      1:8; Amos 2:16); (2) being poorly clad (Isa. 58:7; James
      2:15). It denotes also (3) the state of one who has laid
      aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus), and appears
      clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the
      skin (1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 47:3; comp. Mark 14:52; John
      21:7). It is used figuratively, meaning &quot;being
      discovered&quot; or &quot;made manifest&quot; (Job 26:6;
      Heb. 4:13). In Ex. 32:25 the expression &quot;the people
      were naked&quot; (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in the
      Revised Version &quot;the people were broken loose&quot;,
      i.e., had fallen into a state of lawlessness and
      insubordination. In 2 Chr. 28:19 the words &quot;he made
      Judah naked&quot; (A.V.), but Revised Version &quot;he had
      dealt wantonly in Judah,&quot; mean &quot;he had permitted

      under poetic imagery the future character and history of
      the tribe.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the Exodus this tribe numbered 53,400 adult
      males (Num. 1:43), but at the close of the wanderings they
      numbered only 45,400 (26:48-50). Along with Dan and Asher
      they formed &quot;the camp of Dan,&quot; under a common
      standard (2:25-31), occupying a place during the march on
      the north side of the tabernacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possession assigned to this tribe is set forth in Josh.
      19:32-39. It lay in the north-eastern corner of the land,
      bounded on the east by the Jordan and the lakes of Merom
      and Galilee, and on the north it extended far into
      Coele-Syria, the valley between the two Lebanon ranges. It
      comprehended a greater variety of rich and beautiful
      scenery and of soil and climate than fell to the lot of any
      other tribe. The territory of Naphtali extended to about
      800 square miles, being the double of that of Issachar. The
      region around Kedesh, one of its towns, was originally
      called Galil, a name afterwards given to the whole northern
      division of Canaan. A large number of foreigners settled
      here among the mountains, and hence it was called
      &quot;Galilee of the Gentiles&quot; (q.v.), Matt. 4:15, 16.
      The southern portion of Naphtali has been called the
      &quot;Garden of Palestine.&quot; It was of unrivalled
      fertility. It was the principal scene of our Lord&#39;s
      public ministry. Here most of his parables were spoken and
      his miracles wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tribe was the first to suffer from the invasion of
      Benhadad, king of Syria, in the reigns of Baasha, king of
      Israel, and Asa, king of Judah (1 Kings 15:20; 2 Chr.
      16:4). In the reign of Pekah, king of Israel, the Assyrians
      under Tiglath-pileser swept over the whole north of Israel,
      and carried the people into captivity (2 Kings 15:29). Thus
      the kingdom of Israel came to an end (B.C. 722).
    </p>
    <p>
      Naphtali is now almost wholly a desert, the towns of
      Tiberias, on the shore of the Lake of Galilee, and Safed
      being the only places in it of any importance.

      occurs only in the Gospel of John, who in his list of the
      disciples never mentions Bartholomew, with whom he has

      Hag. 2:6-9; Dan. 9:24, 25). Joseph and Mary were
      providentially led to go up to Bethlehem at this period,
      and there Christ was born (Matt. 2:1, 6; Luke 2:1, 7). The
      exact year or month or day of his birth cannot, however,
      now be exactly ascertained. We know, however, that it took
      place in the &quot;fulness of the time&quot; (Gal. 4:4),
      i.e., at the fittest time in the world&#39;s history.
      Chronologists are now generally agreed that the year 4
      before the Christian era was the year of Christ&#39;s
      nativity, and consequently that he was about four years old
      in the year 1 A.D.</a>

      all other cases the word is rendered &quot;of
      Nazareth&quot; (Mark 1:24; 10:47; 14:67, etc.). When this
      Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was
      meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In
      course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the
      word &quot;Nazarene&quot; carries with it an allusion to
      those prophecies which speak of Christ as &quot;despised of
      men&quot; (Isa. 53:3). Some, however, think that in this
      name there is an allusion to the Hebrew <i>netser</i>,
      which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the
      Messiah (Isa. 11:1), i.e., he whom the prophets called the
      <i>Netse</i>, the &quot;Branch.&quot;</a>

      supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew <i>netser</i>,
      a &quot;shoot&quot; or &quot;sprout.&quot; Some, however,
      think that the name of the city must be connected with the
      name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest
      prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they
      derive it from the Hebrew <i>notserah</i>, i.e., one
      guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which
      overlooks and thus guards an extensive region.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the
      home of Joseph and Mary (Luke 2:39), and here the angel
      announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah (1:26-28).
      Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood (4:16); and
      here he began his public ministry in the synagogue (Matt.
      13:54), at which the people were so offended that they
      sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their
      city was built (Luke 4:29). Twice they expelled him from
      their borders (4:16-29; Matt. 13:54-58); and he finally
      retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works
      because of their unbelief (Matt. 13:58), and took up his
      residence in Capernaum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon,
      on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea
      of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is
      identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or
      ten thousand inhabitants. It lies &quot;as in a hollow
      cup&quot; lower down upon the hill than the ancient city.
      The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of
      Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence
      northward to Damascus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in John 1:46
      that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute,
      either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a
      rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced
      by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their
      lower type of moral and religious character. But there
      seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions.
      The Jews believed that, according to Micah 5:2, the birth
      of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere
      else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen,
      and believed that the great &quot;good&quot; which they
      were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is
      probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not
      seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee
      were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held
      in contempt, in the time of our Lord. (See Dr.
      Merrill&#39;s Galilee in the Time of Christ.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time
      of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The so-called &#39;Holy House&#39; is a cave under
      the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a
      tank. The &#39;brow of the hill&#39;, site of the attempted
      precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the
      traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at
      some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites
      are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The
      name Nazareth perhaps means &#39;a watch tower&#39; (now
      en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with
      Netzer, &#39;a branch&#39; (Isa. 4:2; Jer. 23:5; Zech. 3:8;
      6:12; Matt. 2:23), Nazarene being quite a different word
      from Nazarite.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002677"><b>Nazarite -</b> (Heb. form Nazirite),
      the name of such Israelites as took on them the vow
      prescribed in Num. 6:2-21. The word denotes generally one
      who is separated from others and consecrated to God.
      Although there is no mention of any Nazarite before Samson,
      yet it is evident that they existed before the time of
      Moses. The vow of a Nazarite involved these three things,
      (1) abstinence from wine and strong drink, (2) refraining
      from cutting the hair off the head during the whole period
      of the continuance of the vow, and (3) the avoidance of
      contact with the dead.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the period of the continuance of the vow came to an
      end, the Nazarite had to present himself at the door of the
      sanctuary with (1) a he lamb of the first year for a
      burnt-offering, (2) a ewe lamb of the first year for a
      sin-offering, and (3) a ram for a peace-offering. After
      these sacrifices were offered by the priest, the Nazarite
      cut off his hair at the door and threw it into the fire
      under the peace-offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason, probably in the midst of his work at
      Corinth, Paul took on himself the Nazarite vow. This could
      only be terminated by his going up to Jerusalem to offer up
      the hair which till then was to be left uncut. But it seems
      to have been allowable for persons at a distance to cut the
      hair, which was to be brought up to Jerusalem, where the
      ceremony was completed. This Paul did at Cenchrea just
      before setting out on his voyage into Syria (Acts 18:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion (Acts 21:23-26), at the feast of
      Pentecost, Paul took on himself again the Nazarite vow.
      &quot;The ceremonies involved took a longer time than Paul
      had at his disposal, but the law permitted a man to share
      the vow if he could find companions who had gone through
      the prescribed ceremonies, and who permitted him to join
      their company. This permission was commonly granted if the
      new comer paid all the fees required from the whole company
      (fee to the Levite for cutting the hair and fees for
      sacrifices), and finished the vow along with the others.
      Four Jewish Christians were performing the vow, and would
      admit Paul to their company, provided he paid their
      expenses. Paul consented, paid the charges, and when the
      last seven days of the vow began he went with them to live
      in the temple, giving the usual notice to the priests that
      he had joined in regular fashion, was a sharer with the
      four men, and that his vow would end with theirs. Nazarites
      retired to the temple during the last period of seven days,
      because they could be secure there against any accidental
      defilement&quot; (Lindsay&#39;s Acts).
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the duration of a Nazarite&#39;s vow, every one was
      left at liberty to fix his own time. There is mention made
      in Scripture of only three who were Nazarites for life,
      Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist (Judg. 13:4, 5; 1 Sam.
      1:11; Luke 1:15). In its ordinary form, however, the
      Nazarite&#39;s vow lasted only thirty, and at most one
      hundred, days. (See <a href=

      where a furious battle was fought, resulting in the
      complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back (Jer.
      46:2-12), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway of
      Babylon (B.C. 606). From that time &quot;the king of Egypt
      came not again any more out of his land&quot; (2 Kings
      24:7). Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine,
      and took Jerusalem, carrying away captive a great multitude
      of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and his companions
      (Dan. 1:1, 2; Jer. 27:19; 40:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in
      Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the
      oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt (2 Kings 24:1). This
      led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest
      of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (B.C. 598). A
      third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom
      he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the
      population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the
      temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his
      stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet,
      entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against
      Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city,
      which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (B.C. 586).
      Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by
      order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for
      the remainder of his life.

      An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it
      an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and
      genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be
      genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the
      portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes),
      called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of
      &quot;Nebuchadrezzar.&quot; The inscription has been thus
      translated:, &quot;In honour of Merodach, his lord,
      Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this
      made.&quot;

      A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the
      following inscription, the only one as yet found which
      refers to his wars: &quot;In the thirty-seventh year of
      Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to
      Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected
      [his army], and marched and spread abroad.&quot; Thus were
      fulfilled the words of the prophet (Jer. 46:13-26; Ezek.
      29:2-20). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia,
      and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set
      himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon (Dan.
      4:30), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his
      kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs
      surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the
      kind mentioned in history (Dan. 2:37). He is represented as
      a &quot;king of kings,&quot; ruling over a vast kingdom of
      many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers
      under him, &quot;princes, governors, captains,&quot; etc.
      (3:2, 3, 27). He may, indeed, be said to have created the
      mighty empire over which he ruled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the
      greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East
      generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an
      enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon
      itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that
      in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed
      of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built
      or restored almost every city and temple in the whole
      country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the
      immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon
      itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, &#39;Is not this
      great Babylon which I have build?&#39;&quot; Rawlinson,

      After the incident of the &quot;burning fiery furnace&quot;
      (Dan. 3) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast,
      Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental
      aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity,
      probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e,
      &quot;the change of a man into a wolf&quot;). A remarkable
      confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the
      recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an
      inscription to the effect that it was presented by
      Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive
      offering on account of his recovery from a terrible
      illness. (See <a href=

      He survived his recovery for some years, and died B.C. 562,
      in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after
      a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son
      Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was
      succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by
      Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less
      than a quarter of a century after the death of
      Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the
      combined armies of Media and Persia.

      son and successor of Psammetichus (B.C. 610-594), the
      contemporary of Josiah, king of Judah. For some reason he
      proclaimed war against the king of Assyria. He led forth a
      powerful army and marched northward, but was met by the
      king of Judah at Megiddo, who refused him a passage through
      his territory. Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah
      was slain (2 Chr. 35:20-24). Possibly, as some suppose,
      Necho may have brought his army by sea to some port to the
      north of Dor (comp. Josh. 11:2; 12:23), a Phoenician town
      at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle Necho
      marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered
      the Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces,
      including Palestine, came under his dominion.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return march he deposed Jehoahaz, who had succeeded
      his father Josiah, and made Eliakim, Josiah&#39;s eldest
      son, whose name he changed into Jehoiakim, king. Jehoahaz
      he carried down into Egypt, where he died (2 Kings 23:31; 2
      Chr. 36:1-4). Four years after this conquest Necho again
      marched to the Euphrates; but here he was met and his army
      routed by the Chaldeans (B.C. 606) under Nebuchadnezzar,
      who drove the Egyptians back, and took from them all the
      territory they had conquered, from the Euphrates unto the
      &quot;river of Egypt&quot; (Jer. 46:2; 2 Kings 24:7, 8).
      Soon after this Necho died, and was succeeded by his son,
      Psammetichus II. (See <a href=

    <p>
      (3.) The son of Hachaliah (Neh. 1:1), and probably of the
      tribe of Judah. His family must have belonged to Jerusalem
      (Neh. 2:3). He was one of the &quot;Jews of the
      dispersion,&quot; and in his youth was appointed to the
      important office of royal cup-bearer at the palace of
      Shushan. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, seems to have
      been on terms of friendly familiarity with his attendant.
      Through his brother Hanani, and perhaps from other sources
      (Neh. 1:2; 2:3), he heard of the mournful and desolate
      condition of the Holy City, and was filled with sadness of
      heart. For many days he fasted and mourned and prayed for
      the place of his fathers&#39; sepulchres. At length the
      king observed his sadness of countenance and asked the
      reason of it. Nehemiah explained it all to the king, and
      obtained his permission to go up to Jerusalem and there to
      act as <i>tirshatha</i>, or governor of Judea. He went up
      in the spring of B.C. 446 (eleven years after Ezra), with a
      strong escort supplied by the king, and with letters to all
      the pashas of the provinces through which he had to pass,
      as also to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, directing
      him to assist Nehemiah. On his arrival he set himself to
      survey the city, and to form a plan for its restoration; a
      plan which he carried out with great skill and energy, so
      that the whole was completed in about six months. He
      remained in Judea for thirteen years as governor, carrying
      out many reforms, notwithstanding much opposition that he
      encountered (Neh. 13:11). He built up the state on the old
      lines, &quot;supplementing and completing the work of
      Ezra,&quot; and making all arrangements for the safety and
      good government of the city. At the close of this important
      period of his public life, he returned to Persia to the
      service of his royal master at Shushan or Ecbatana. Very
      soon after this the old corrupt state of things returned,
      showing the worthlessness to a large extent of the
      professions that had been made at the feast of the
      dedication of the walls of the city (Neh. 12. See EZRA
      &macr;T0001294). Malachi now appeared among the people with
      words of stern reproof and solemn warning; and Nehemiah
      again returned from Persia (after an absence of some two
      years), and was grieved to see the widespread moral
      degeneracy that had taken place during his absence. He set
      himself with vigour to rectify the flagrant abuses that had
      sprung up, and restored the orderly administration of
      public worship and the outward observance of the law of
      Moses. Of his subsequent history we know nothing. Probably
      he remained at his post as governor till his death (about
      B.C. 413) in a good old age. The place of his death and
      burial is, however, unknown. &quot;He resembled Ezra in his
      fiery zeal, in his active spirit of enterprise, and in the
      piety of his life: but he was of a bluffer and a fiercer
      mood; he had less patience with transgressors; he was a man
      of action rather than a man of thought, and more inclined
      to use force than persuasion. His practical sagacity and
      high courage were very markedly shown in the arrangement
      with which he carried through the rebuilding of the wall
      and balked the cunning plans of the &#39;adversaries.&#39;
      The piety of his heart, his deeply religious spirit and
      constant sense of communion with and absolute dependence
      upon God, are strikingly exhibited, first in the long
      prayer recorded in ch. 1:5-11, and secondly and most
      remarkably in what have been called his &#39;interjectional
      prayers&#39;, those short but moving addresses to Almighty
      God which occur so frequently in his writings, the
      instinctive outpouring of a heart deeply moved, but ever
      resting itself upon God, and looking to God alone for aid
      in trouble, for the frustration of evil designs, and for
      final reward and acceptance&quot; (Rawlinson). Nehemiah was
      the last of the governors sent from the Persian court.
      Judea after this was annexed to the satrapy of Coele-Syria,
      and was governed by the high priest under the jurisdiction
      of the governor of Syria, and the internal government of
      the country became more and more a hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002697"><b>Nehemiah, Book of -</b> The author of
      this book was no doubt Nehemiah himself. There are portions
      of the book written in the first person (ch. 1-7; 12:27-47,
      and 13). But there are also portions of it in which
      Nehemiah is spoken of in the third person (ch. 8; 9; 10).
      It is supposed that these portions may have been written by
      Ezra; of this, however, there is no distinct evidence.
      These portions had their place assigned them in the book,
      there can be no doubt, by Nehemiah. He was the responsible
      author of the whole book, with the exception of ch. 12:11,
      22, 23.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The date at which the book was written was probably about
      B.C. 431-430, when Nehemiah had returned the second time to
      Jerusalem after his visit to Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, which may historically be regarded as a
      continuation of the book of Ezra, consists of four parts.
      (1.) An account of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem,
      and of the register Nehemiah had found of those who had
      returned from Babylon (ch. 1-7). (2.) An account of the
      state of religion among the Jews during this time (8-10).
      (3.) Increase of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the census
      of the adult male population, and names of the chiefs,
      together with lists of priests and Levites (11-12:1-26).
      (4.) Dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the arrangement
      of the temple officers, and the reforms carried out by
      Nehemiah (12:27-ch. 13).
    </p>
