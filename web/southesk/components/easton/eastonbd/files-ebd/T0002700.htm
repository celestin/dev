      thing a name of contempt given to the serpent Moses had
      made in the wilderness (Num. 21:8), and which Hezekiah
      destroyed because the children of Israel began to regard it
      as an idol and &quot;burn incense to it.&quot; The lapse of
      nearly one thousand years had invested the &quot;brazen
      serpent&quot; with a mysterious sanctity; and in order to
      deliver the people from their infatuation, and impress them
      with the idea of its worthlessness, Hezekiah called it, in
      contempt, &quot;Nehushtan,&quot; a brazen thing, a mere
      piece of brass (2 Kings 18:4).</a>

      town in the territory of Asher, near its southern border
      (Josh. 19:27). It has been identified with the ruin
      Y&#39;anin, near the outlet of the Wady esh Sha-ghur, less
      than 2 miles north of Kabul, and 16 miles east of
      Caesarea.</a>

      east of Bessum, a ruin half way between Tiberias and Mount
      Tabor.</a>

      <a name="T0002703"><b>Nemuel -</b> day of God. (1.) One of
      Simeon&#39;s five sons (1 Chr. 4:24), called also Jemuel
      (Gen. 46:10). (2.) A Reubenite, a son of Eliab, and brother
      of Dathan and Abiram (Num. 26:9).</a>

      <a name="T0002704"><b>Nephilim -</b> (Gen. 6:4; Num. 13:33,
      R.V.), giants, the Hebrew word left untranslated by the
      Revisers, the name of one of the Canaanitish tribes. The
      Revisers have, however, translated the Hebrew gibborim, in
      Gen. 6:4, &quot;mighty men.&quot;</a>

      a stream issuing from it on the border between Judah and
      Benjamin (Josh. 15:8, 9; 18:15). It has been identified
      with &#39;Ain Lifta, a spring about 2 1/2 miles north-west
      of Jerusalem. Others, however, have identified it with
      &#39;Ain&#39; Atan, on the south-west of Bethlehem, whence
      water is conveyed through &quot;Pilate&#39;s aqueduct&quot;
      to the Haram area at Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002706"><b>Ner -</b> light, the father of Kish
      (1 Chr. 8:33). 1 Sam. 14:51 should be read, &quot;Kish, the
      father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were the sons
      of Abiel.&quot; And hence this Kish and Ner were brothers,
      and Saul and Abner were first cousins (comp. 1 Chr.
      9:36).</a>

      whom Paul sent his salutation (Rom. 16:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002708"><b>Nergal -</b> the great dog; that is,
      lion, one of the chief gods of the Assyrians and
      Babylonians (2 Kings 17:30), the god of war and hunting. He
      is connected with Cutha as its tutelary deity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002709"><b>Nergal-sharezer -</b> Nergal, protect
      the king! (1.) One of the &quot;princes of the king of
      Babylon who accompanied him in his last expedition against
      Jerusalem&quot; (Jer. 39:3, 13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another of the &quot;princes,&quot; who bore the title
      of &quot;Rabmag.&quot; He was one of those who were sent to
      release Jeremiah from prison (Jer. 39:13) by &quot;the
      captain of the guard.&quot; He was a Babylonian grandee of
      high rank. From profane history and the inscriptions, we
      are led to conclude that he was the Neriglissar who
      murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and
      succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (B.C. 559-556). He
      was married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a
      palace, the only one on the right bank of the Euphrates,
      bear inscriptions denoting that it was built by this king.
      He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was murdered
      after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the
      nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant
      throne, and reigned for a period of seventeen years (B.C.
      555-538), at the close of which period Babylon was taken by
      Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in connection with
      the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been
      the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s
      son (Dan. 5:11, 18, 22), because he had married his
      daughter. But it is known from the inscriptions that
      Nabonadius had a son called Belshazzar, who may have been
      his father&#39;s associate on the throne at the time of the
      fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson of
      Nebuchadnezzar. The Jews had only one word, usually
      rendered &quot;father,&quot; to represent also such a
      relationship as that of &quot;grandfather&quot; or
      &quot;great-grandfather.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002710"><b>Nero -</b> occurs only in the
      superscription (which is probably spurious, and is
      altogether omitted in the R.V.) to the Second Epistle to
      Timothy. He became emperor of Rome when he was about
      seventeen years of age (A.D. 54), and soon began to exhibit
      the character of a cruel tyrant and heathen debauchee. In
      May A.D. 64, a terrible conflagration broke out in Rome,
      which raged for six days and seven nights, and totally
      destroyed a great part of the city. The guilt of this fire
      was attached to him at the time, and the general verdict of
      history accuses him of the crime. &quot;Hence, to suppress
      the rumour,&quot; says Tacitus (Annals, xv. 44), &quot;he
      falsely charged with the guilt, and punished with the most
      exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called Christians,
      who are hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder
      of that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius
      Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but
      the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke
      out again, not only throughout Judea, where the mischief
      originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all
      things horrible and disgraceful flow, from all quarters, as
      to a common receptacle, and where they are encouraged.
      Accordingly, first three were seized, who confessed they
      were Christians. Next, on their information, a vast
      multitude were convicted, not so much on the charge of
      burning the city as of hating the human race. And in their
      deaths they were also made the subjects of sport; for they
      were covered with the hides of wild beasts and worried to
      death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and,
      when day declined, burned to serve for nocturnal lights.
      Nero offered his own gardens for that spectacle, and
      exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with
      the common people in the habit of a charioteer, or else
      standing in his chariot; whence a feeling of compassion
      arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to
      be made examples of by capital punishment, because they
      seemed not to be cut off for the public good, but victims
      to the ferocity of one man.&quot; Another Roman historian,
      Suetonius (Nero, xvi.), says of him: &quot;He likewise
      inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people
      who hold a new and impious superstition&quot; (Forbes&#39;s
      Footsteps of St. Paul, p. 60).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nero was the emperor before whom Paul was brought on his
      first imprisonment at Rome, and the apostle is supposed to
      have suffered martyrdom during this persecution. He is
      repeatedly alluded to in Scripture (Acts 25:11; Phil. 1:12,
      13; 4:22). He died A.D. 68.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002711"><b>Net -</b> in use among the Hebrews
      for fishing, hunting, and fowling. The fishing-net was
      probably constructed after the form of that used by the
      Egyptians (Isa. 19:8). There were three kinds of nets. (1.)
      The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr. sagene), of great size,
      and requiring many men to work it. It was usually let down
      from the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or into
      the boat, as circumstances might require (Matt. 13:47, 48).
      (2.) The hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron), which
      was thrown from a rock or a boat at any fish that might be
      seen (Matt. 4:18; Mark 1:16). It was called by the Latins
      funda. It was of circular form, &quot;like the top of a
      tent.&quot; (3.) The bag-net (Gr. diktyon), used for
      enclosing fish in deep water (Luke 5:4-9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fowling-nets were (1) the trap, consisting of a net
      spread over a frame, and supported by a stick in such a way
      that it fell with the slightest touch (Amos 3:5,
      &quot;gin;&quot; Ps. 69:22; Job 18:9; Eccl. 9:12). (2) The
      snare, consisting of a cord to catch birds by the leg (Job
      18:10; Ps. 18:5; 116:3; 140:5). (3.) The decoy, a cage
      filled with birds as decoys (Jer. 5:26, 27). Hunting-nets
      were much in use among the Hebrews.

    <p>
      (2.) One of David&#39;s brothers (1 Chr. 2:14).

      was brought up to Jerusalem (1 Chr. 15:24).

    <p>
      (4.) A Levite (1 Chr. 24:6).

      (5.) A temple porter, of the family of the Korhites (1 Chr.
      26:4).

      (6.) One of the &quot;princes&quot; appointed by
      Jehoshaphat to teach the law through the cities of Judah (2
      Chr. 17:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) A chief Levite in the time of Josiah (2 Chr. 35:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) Ezra 10:22.
    </p>
    <p>
      (9.) Neh. 12:21.
    </p>
    <p>
      (10.) A priest&#39;s son who bore a trumpet at the
      dedication of the walls of Jerusalem (Neh. 12:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002713"><b>Nethaniah -</b> given of Jehovah.
      (1.) One of Asaph&#39;s sons, appointed by David to
      minister in the temple (1 Chr. 25:2, 12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Levite sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the law (2 Chr.
      17:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Jer. 36:14.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) 2 Kings 25:23, 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002714"><b>Nethinim -</b> the name given to the
      hereditary temple servants in all the post-Exilian books of
      Scripture. The word means given, i.e., &quot;those set
      apart&quot;, viz., to the menial work of the sanctuary for
      the Levites. The name occurs seventeen times, and in each
      case in the Authorized Version incorrectly terminates in
      &quot;s&quot;, &quot;Nethinims;&quot; in the Revised
      Version, correctly without the &quot;s&quot; (Ezra 2:70;
      7:7, 24; 8:20, etc.). The tradition is that the Gibeonites
      (Josh. 9:27) were the original caste, afterwards called
      Nethinim. Their numbers were added to afterwards from
      captives taken in battle; and they were formally given by
      David to the Levites (Ezra 8:20), and so were called
      Nethinim, i.e., the given ones, given to the Levites to be
      their servants. Only 612 Nethinim returned from Babylon
      (Ezra 2:58; 8:20). They were under the control of a chief
      from among themselves (2:43; Neh. 7:46). No reference to
      them appears in the New Testament, because it is probable
      that they became merged in the general body of the Jewish
      people.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002715"><b>Netophah -</b> distillation;
      dropping, a town in Judah, in the neighbourhood, probably,
      of Bethlehem (Neh. 7:26; 1 Chr. 2:54). Two of David&#39;s
      guards were Netophathites (1 Chr. 27:13, 15). It has been
      identified with the ruins of Metoba, or Um Toba, to the
      north-east of Bethlehem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002716"><b>Nettle -</b> (1.) Heb. haral,
      &quot;pricking&quot; or &quot;burning,&quot; Prov. 24:30,
      31 (R.V. marg., &quot;wild vetches&quot;); Job 30:7; Zeph.
      2:9. Many have supposed that some thorny or prickly plant
      is intended by this word, such as the bramble, the thistle,
      the wild plum, the cactus or prickly pear, etc. It may
      probably be a species of mustard, the Sinapis arvensis,
      which is a pernicious weed abounding in corn-fields.
      Tristram thinks that this word &quot;designates the prickly
      acanthus (Acanthus spinosus), a very common and troublesome
      weed in the plains of Palestine.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. qimmosh, Isa. 34:13; Hos. 9:6; Prov. 24:31 (in
      both versions, &quot;thorns&quot;). This word has been
      regarded as denoting thorns, thistles, wild camomile; but
      probably it is correctly rendered &quot;nettle,&quot; the
      Urtica pilulifera, &quot;a tall and vigorous plant, often 6
      feet high, the sting of which is much more severe and
      irritating than that of our common nettle.&quot;

      rather &quot;New Covenant,&quot; in contrast to the old
      covenant of works, which is superseded. &quot;The covenant
      of grace is called new; it succeeds to the old broken

      excellent; and under the gospel it is dispensed in a more
      clear, spiritual, extensive, and powerful manner than of
      old&quot; (Brown of Haddington). Hence is derived the name

      then unfolded to him, giving prominence to the necessity of
      being &quot;born again.&quot; He is next met with in the
      Sanhedrin (7:50-52), where he protested against the course
      they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he
      is mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the
      anointing and burial of the body of Christ (John 19:39). We
      hear nothing more of him. There can be little doubt that he

      &quot;doctrines&quot; (15). They were seemingly a class of
      professing Christians, who sought to introduce into the

      and the Blue Nile, which rises in the Abyssinian Mountains.
      These unite at the town of Khartoum, whence it pursues its

      Nineveh.&quot; It is not again noticed till the days of
      Jonah, when it is described (Jonah 3:3; 4:11) as a great
      and populous city, the flourishing capital of the Assyrian
      empire (2 Kings 19:36; Isa. 37:37). The book of the prophet
      Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic
      denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter
      desolation are foretold (Nah.1:14; 3:19, etc.). Zephaniah
      also (2:13-15) predicts its destruction along with the fall
      of the empire of which it was the capital. From this time
      there is no mention of it in Scripture till it is named in
      gospel history (Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:32).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This &quot;exceeding great city&quot; lay on the eastern or
      left bank of the river Tigris, along which it stretched for
      some 30 miles, having an average breadth of 10 miles or
      more from the river back toward the eastern hills. This
      whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins.
      Occupying a central position on the great highway between
      the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the
      East and the West, wealth flowed into it from many sources,
      so that it became the greatest of all ancient cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      About B.C. 633 the Assyrian empire began to show signs of
      weakness, and Nineveh was attacked by the Medes, who
      subsequently, about B.C. 625, being joined by the
      Babylonians and Susianians, again attacked it, when it
      fell, and was razed to the ground. The Assyrian empire then
      came to an end, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its
      provinces between them. &quot;After having ruled for more
      than six hundred years with hideous tyranny and violence,
      from the Caucasus and the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and
      from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor and Egypt, it vanished
      like a dream&quot; (Nah. 2:6-11). Its end was strange,
      sudden, tragic. It was God&#39;s doing, his judgement on
      Assyria&#39;s pride (Isa. 10:5-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty years ago our knowledge of the great Assyrian empire
      and of its magnificent capital was almost wholly a blank.
      Vague memories had indeed survived of its power and
      greatness, but very little was definitely known about it.
      Other cities which had perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis,
      and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of
      their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh,
      not a single vestige seemed to remain, and the very place
      on which it had stood was only matter of conjecture. In
      fulfilment of prophecy, God made &quot;an utter end of the
      place.&quot; It became a &quot;desolation.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of the Greek historian Herodotus, B.C. 400, it
      had become a thing of the past; and when Xenophon the
      historian passed the place in the &quot;Retreat of the Ten
      Thousand,&quot; the very memory of its name had been lost.
      It was buried out of sight, and no one knew its grave. It
      is never again to rise from its ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after being lost for more than two thousand
      years, the city was disentombed. A little more than forty
      years ago the French consul at Mosul began to search the
      vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river.
      The Arabs whom he employed in these excavations, to their
      great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the
      mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned
      out to be the royal palace of Sargon, one of the Assyrian
      kings. They found their way into its extensive courts and
      chambers, and brought forth form its hidded depths many
      wonderful sculptures and other relics of those ancient
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of exploration has been carried on almost
      continuously by M. Botta, Sir Henry Layard, George Smith,
      and others, in the mounds of Nebi-Yunus, Nimrud, Koyunjik,
      and Khorsabad, and a vast treasury of specimens of old
      Assyrian art has been exhumed. Palace after palace has been
      discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured
      slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient
      people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their
      religion, the style of their architecture, and the
      magnificence of their monarchs. The streets of the city
      have been explored, the inscriptions on the bricks and
      tablets and sculptured figures have been read, and now the
      secrets of their history have been brought to light.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most remarkable of recent discoveries is that of
      the library of King Assur-bani-pal, or, as the Greek
      historians call him, Sardanapalos, the grandson of
      Sennacherib (q.v.). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000300.html&amp;from=T0000347&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      ASNAPPER</a>.) This library consists of about ten thousand
      flat bricks or tablets, all written over with Assyrian
      characters. They contain a record of the history, the laws,
      and the religion of Assyria, of the greatest value. These
      strange clay leaves found in the royal library form the
      most valuable of all the treasuries of the literature of
      the old world. The library contains also old Accadian
      documents, which are the oldest extant documents in the
      world, dating as far back as probably about the time of
      Abraham. (See <a href=

      SARGON</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The Assyrian royalty is, perhaps, the most luxurious
      of our century [reign of Assur-bani-pa]...Its victories and
      conquests, uninterrupted for one hundred years, have
      enriched it with the spoil of twenty peoples. Sargon has
      taken what remained to the Hittites; Sennacherib overcame
      Chaldea, and the treasures of Babylon were transferred to
      his coffers; Esarhaddon and Assur-bani-pal himself have
      pillaged Egypt and her great cities, Sais, Memphis, and
      Thebes of the hundred gates...Now foreign merchants flock
      into Nineveh, bringing with them the most valuable
      productions from all countries, gold and perfume from South
      Arabia and the Chaldean Sea, Egyptian linen and glass-work,
      carved enamels, goldsmiths&#39; work, tin, silver,
      Phoenician purple; cedar wood from Lebanon, unassailable by
      worms; furs and iron from Asia Minor and Armenia&quot;
      (Ancient Egypt and Assyria, by G. Maspero, page 271).
    </p>
    <p>
      The bas-reliefs, alabaster slabs, and sculptured monuments
      found in these recovered palaces serve in a remarkable
      manner to confirm the Old Testament history of the kings of
      Israel. The appearance of the ruins shows that the
      destruction of the city was due not only to the assailing
      foe but also to the flood and the fire, thus confirming the
      ancient prophecies concerning it. &quot;The recent
      excavations,&quot; says Rawlinson, &quot;have shown that
      fire was a great instrument in the destruction of the
      Nineveh palaces. Calcined alabaster, charred wood, and
      charcoal, colossal statues split through with heat, are met
      with in parts of the Nineveh mounds, and attest the
      veracity of prophecy.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nineveh in its glory was (Jonah 3:4) an &quot;exceeding
      great city of three days&#39; journey&quot;, i.e., probably
      in circuit. This would give a circumference of about 60
      miles. At the four corners of an irregular quadrangle are
      the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless and Khorsabad.
      These four great masses of ruins, with the whole area
      included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn
      from the one to the other, are generally regarded as
      composing the whole ruins of Nineveh.

      (Jer. 46:25, 26). Cambyses, king of the Persians (B.C.
      525), further laid it waste by fire. Its ruin was completed
      (B.C. 81) by Ptolemy Lathyrus. The ruins of this city are
      still among the most notable in the valley of the Nile.

      Adam&#39;s death. This patriarch is rightly regarded as the
      connecting link between the old and the new world. He is
      the second great progenitor of the human family.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of his father Lamech at his birth (Gen. 5:29)
      have been regarded as in a sense prophetical, designating
      Noah as a type of Him who is the true &quot;rest and
      comfort&quot; of men under the burden of life (Matt.11:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived five hundred years, and then there were born unto
      him three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth (Gen. 5:32). He was
      a &quot;just man and perfect in his generation,&quot; and
      &quot;walked with God&quot; (comp. Ezek. 14:14,20). But now
      the descendants of Cain and of Seth began to intermarry,
      and then there sprang up a race distinguished for their
      ungodliness. Men became more and more corrupt, and God
      determined to sweep the earth of its wicked population
      (Gen. 6:7). But with Noah God entered into a covenant, with
      a promise of deliverance from the threatened deluge (18).
      He was accordingly commanded to build an ark (6:14-16) for
      the saving of himself and his house. An interval of one
      hundred and twenty years elapsed while the ark was being
      built (6:3), during which Noah bore constant testimony
      against the unbelief and wickedness of that generation (1
      Pet. 3:18-20; 2 Pet. 2:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ark of &quot;gopher-wood&quot; (mentioned only
      here) was at length completed according to the command of
      the Lord, the living creatures that were to be preserved
      entered into it; and then Noah and his wife and sons and
      daughters-in-law entered it, and the &quot;Lord shut him
      in&quot; (Gen.7:16). The judgment-threatened now fell on
      the guilty world, &quot;the world that then was, being
      overflowed with water, perished&quot; (2 Pet. 3:6). The ark
      floated on the waters for one hundred and fifty days, and
      then rested on the mountains of Ararat (Gen. 8:3,4); but
      not for a considerable time after this was divine
      permission given him to leave the ark, so that he and his
      family were a whole year shut up within it (Gen. 6-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the ark Noah&#39;s first act was to erect an
      altar, the first of which there is any mention, and offer
      the sacrifices of adoring thanks and praise to God, who
      entered into a covenant with him, the first covenant
      between God and man, granting him possession of the earth
      by a new and special charter, which remains in force to the
      present time (Gen. 8:21-9:17). As a sign and witness of
      this covenant, the rainbow was adopted and set apart by
      God, as a sure pledge that never again would the earth be
      destroyed by a flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas! Noah after this fell into grievous sin (Gen.
      9:21); and the conduct of Ham on this sad occasion led to
      the memorable prediction regarding his three sons and their
      descendants. Noah &quot;lived after the flood three hundred
      and fifty years, and he died&quot; (28:29). (See DELUGE

      After being supplied with the sacred loaves of showbread,
      and girding on the sword of Goliath, which was brought
      forth from behind the ephod, David fled from Nob and sought
      refuge at the court of Achish, the king of Gath, where he
      was cast into prison. (Comp. titles of Ps. 34 and 56.)

      <a name="T0002753"><b>Numbering of the people -</b> Besides
      the numbering of the tribes mentioned in the history of the
      wanderings in the wilderness, we have an account of a
      general census of the whole nation from Dan to Beersheba,
      which David gave directions to Joab to make (1 Chr. 21:1).
      Joab very reluctantly began to carry out the king&#39;s
      command.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This act of David in ordering a numbering of the people
      arose from pride and a self-glorifying spirit. It indicated
      a reliance on his part on an arm of flesh, an estimating of
      his power not by the divine favour but by the material
      resources of his kingdom. He thought of military
      achievement and of conquest, and forgot that he was
      God&#39;s vicegerent. In all this he sinned against God.
      While Joab was engaged in the census, David&#39;s heart
      smote him, and he became deeply conscious of his fault; and
      in profound humiliation he confessed, &quot;I have sinned
      greatly in what I have done.&quot; The prophet Gad was sent
      to him to put before him three dreadful alternatives (2
      Sam. 24:13; for &quot;seven years&quot; in this verse, the
      LXX. and 1 Chr. 21:12 have &quot;three years&quot;), three
      of Jehovah&#39;s four sore judgments (Ezek. 14:21). Two of
      these David had already experienced. He had fled for some
      months before Absalom, and had suffered three years&#39;
      famine on account of the slaughter of the Gibeonites. In
      his &quot;strait&quot; David said, &quot;Let me fall into
      the hands of the Lord.&quot; A pestilence broke out among
      the people, and in three days swept away 70,000. At
      David&#39;s intercession the plague was stayed, and at the
      threshing-floor of Araunah (q.v.), where the destroying
      angel was arrested in his progress, David erected an altar,
      and there offered up sacrifies to God (2 Chr. 3:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The census, so far as completed, showed that there were at
      least 1,300,000 fighting men in the kingdom, indicating at
      that time a population of about six or seven millions in
      all. (See <a href=

      the books of the Pentateuch, called in the Hebrew
      be-midbar, i.e., &quot;in the wilderness.&quot; In the LXX.
      version it is called &quot;Numbers,&quot; and this name is
      now the usual title of the book. It is so called because it
      contains a record of the numbering of the people in the
      wilderness of Sinai (1-4), and of their numbering
      afterwards on the plain of Moab (26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This book is of special historical interest as furnishing
      us with details as to the route of the Israelites in the
      wilderness and their principal encampments. It may be
      divided into three parts:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations
      for their resuming their march (1-10:10). The sixth chapter
      gives an account of the vow of a Nazarite.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the
      sending out of the spies and the report they brought back,
      and the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the
      hardships by the way (10:11-21:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing
      the Jordan (21:21-ch. 36).
    </p>
    <p>
      The period comprehended in the history extends from the
      second month of the second year after the Exodus to the
      beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in
      all about thirty-eight years and ten months; a dreary
      period of wanderings, during which that disobedient
      generation all died in the wilderness. They were fewer in
      number at the end of their wanderings than when they left
      the land of Egypt. We see in this history, on the one hand,
      the unceasing care of the Almighty over his chosen people
      during their wanderings; and, on the other hand, the
      murmurings and rebellions by which they offended their
      heavenly Protector, drew down repeated marks of his
      displeasure, and provoked him to say that they should
      &quot;not enter into his rest&quot; because of their
      unbelief (Heb. 3:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      This, like the other books of the Pentateuch, bears
      evidence of having been written by Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression &quot;the book of the wars of the
      Lord,&quot; occurring in 21:14, has given rise to much
      discussion. But, after all, &quot;what this book was is
      uncertain, whether some writing of Israel not now extant,
      or some writing of the Amorites which contained songs and
      triumphs of their king Sihon&#39;s victories, out of which
      Moses may cite this testimony, as Paul sometimes does out
      of heathen poets (Acts 17:28; Titus 1:12).&quot;

      Jacob sent into Egypt for the purpose of conciliating
      Joseph (Gen. 43:11). This was the fruit of the pistachio
      tree, which resembles the sumac. It is of the size of an

      rendered &quot;oak.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) &#39;El occurs only in the word El-paran (Gen. 14:6).
      The LXX. renders by &quot;terebinth.&quot; In the plural
      form this word occurs in Isa. 1:29; 57:5 (A.V. marg. and
      R.V., &quot;among the oaks&quot;); 61:3
      (&quot;trees&quot;). The word properly means strongly,
      mighty, and hence a strong tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) &#39;Elah, Gen. 35:4, &quot;under the oak which was by
      Shechem&quot; (R.V. marg., &quot;terebinth&quot;). Isa.
      6:13, A.V., &quot;teil-tree;&quot; R.V.,
      &quot;terebinth.&quot; Isa. 1:30, R.V. marg.,
      &quot;terebinth.&quot; Absalom in his flight was caught in
      the branches of a &quot;great oak&quot; (2 Sam. 18:9; R.V.
      marg., &quot;terebinth&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) &#39;Elon, Judg. 4:11; 9:6 (R.V., &quot;oak;&quot;
      A.V., following the Targum, &quot;plain&quot;) properly the
      deciduous species of oak shedding its foliage in autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) &#39;Elan, only in Dan. 4:11,14,20, rendered
      &quot;tree&quot; in Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s dream. Probably
      some species of the oak is intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) &#39;Allah, Josh. 24:26. The place here referred to is
      called Allon-moreh (&quot;the oak of Moreh,&quot; as in
      R.V.) in Gen. 12:6 and 35:4.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) &#39;Allon, always rendered &quot;oak.&quot; Probably
      the evergreen oak (called also ilex and holm oak) is
      intended. The oak woods of Bashan are frequently alluded to
      (Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6). Three species of oaks are found in
      Palestine, of which the &quot;prickly evergreen oak&quot;
      (Quercus coccifera) is the most abundant. &quot;It covers
      the rocky hills of Palestine with a dense brushwood of
      trees from 8 to 12 feet high, branching from the base,
      thickly covered with small evergreen rigid leaves, and
      bearing acorns copiously.&quot; The so-called Abraham&#39;s
      oak at Hebron is of this species. Tristram says that this
      oak near Hebron &quot;has for several centuries taken the
      place of the once renowned terebinth which marked the site
      of Mamre on the other side of the city. The terebinth
      existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and under it the
      captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared about A.D.
      330, and no tree now marks the grove of Mamre. The present
      oak is the noblest tree in Southern Palestine, being 23
      feet in girth, and the diameter of the foliage, which is
      unsymmetrical, being about 90 feet.&quot; (See HEBRON
      &macr;T0001712; TEIL-TREE &macr;T0003597.)

    <p>
      <a name="T0002759"><b>Oath -</b> a solemn appeal to God,
      permitted on fitting occasions (Deut. 6:13; Jer. 4:2), in
      various forms (Gen. 16:5; 2 Sam. 12:5; Ruth 1:17; Hos.
      4:15; Rom. 1:9), and taken in different ways (Gen. 14:22;
      24:2; 2 Chr. 6:22). God is represented as taking an oath
      (Heb. 6:16-18), so also Christ (Matt. 26:64), and Paul
      (Rom. 9:1; Gal. 1:20; Phil. 1:8). The precept, &quot;Swear
      not at all,&quot; refers probably to ordinary conversation
      between man and man (Matt. 5:34,37). But if the words are
      taken as referring to oaths, then their intention may have
      been to show &quot;that the proper state of Christians is
      to require no oaths; that when evil is expelled from among
      them every yea and nay will be as decisive as an oath,
      every promise as binding as a vow.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002760"><b>Obadiah -</b> servant of the Lord.
      (1.) An Israelite who was chief in the household of King
      Ahab (1 Kings 18:3). Amid great spiritual degeneracy he
      maintained his fidelity to God, and interposed to protect
      The Lord&#39;s prophets, an hundred of whom he hid at great
      personal risk in a cave (4, 13). Ahab seems to have held
      Obadiah in great honour, although he had no sympathy with
      his piety (5, 6, 7). The last notice of him is his bringing
      back tidings to Ahab that Elijah, whom he had so long
      sought for, was at hand (9-16). &quot;Go,&quot; said Elijah
      to him, when he met him in the way, &quot;go tell thy lord,
      Behold, Elijah is here.&quot;</a>

      (Ezra 8:9).

      (10.) A prophet, fourth of the minor prophets in the Hebrew
      canon, and fifth in the LXX. He was probably contemporary
      with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Of his personal history nothing
      is known.

      <a name="T0002761"><b>Obadiah, Book of -</b> consists of
      one chapter, &quot;concerning Edom,&quot; its impending
      doom (1:1-16), and the restoration of Israel (1:17-21).
      This is the shortest book of the Old Testament.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are on record the account of four captures of
      Jerusalem, (1) by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam (1 Kings
      14:25); (2) by the Philistines and Arabians in the reign of
      Jehoram (2 Chr. 21:16); (3) by Joash, the king of Israel,
      in the reign of Amaziah (2 Kings 14:13); and (4) by the
      Babylonians, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by
      Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586). Obadiah (1:11-14) speaks of this
      capture as a thing past. He sees the calamity as having
      already come on Jerusalem, and the Edomites as joining
      their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing about
      the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read
      that the Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans,
      but the probabilities are that they did so, and this
      explains the words of Obadiah in denouncing against Edom
      the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies was thus
      in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edom is the type of Israel&#39;s and of God&#39;s last foe
      (Isa. 63:1-4). These will finally all be vanquished, and
      the kingdom will be the Lord&#39;s (comp. Ps. 22:28).

      have been used among the Hebrews. It was used for many
      purposes: for anointing the body or the hair (Ex. 29:7; 2
      Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 92:10; 104:15; Luke 7:46); in some of
      the offerings (Ex. 29:40; Lev. 7:12; Num. 6:15; 15:4), but
      was excluded from the sin-offering (Lev. 5:11) and the
      jealousy-offering (Num. 5:15); for burning in lamps (Ex.
      25:6; 27:20; Matt. 25:3); for medicinal purposes (Isa. 1:6;

    <p>
      It was one of the most valuable products of the country

      extensive commerce with Tyre (27:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of it was a sign of gladness (Ps. 92:10; Isa.
      61:3), and its omission a token of sorrow (2 Sam. 14:2;
      Matt. 6:17). It was very abundant in Galilee. (See <a href=

      (R.V., &quot;olive wood&quot;) and &quot;pine
      branches&quot; in Neh. 8:15 (R.V., &quot;branches of wild
      olive&quot;), was some tree distinct from the olive. It was
      probably the oleaster (Eleagnus angustifolius), which grows
      abundantly in almost all parts of Palestine, especially
      about Hebron and Samaria. &quot;It has a fine hard
      wood,&quot; says Tristram, &quot;and yields an inferior
      oil, but it has no relationship to the olive, which,

      <a name="T0002778"><b>Olive -</b> the fruit of the
      olive-tree. This tree yielded oil which was highly valued.
      The best oil was from olives that were plucked before being
      fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed (Deut. 24:20; Isa.
      17:6; 24:13). It was called &quot;beaten,&quot; or
      &quot;fresh oil&quot; (Ex. 27:20). There were also
      oil-presses, in which the oil was trodden out by the feet
      (Micah 6:15). James (3:12) calls the fruit &quot;olive
      berries.&quot; The phrase &quot;vineyards and olives&quot;
      (Judg. 15:5, A.V.) should be simply &quot;olive-yard,&quot;
      or &quot;olive-garden,&quot; as in the Revised Version.

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002779"><b>Olive-tree -</b> is frequently
      mentioned in Scripture. The dove from the ark brought an
      olive-branch to Noah (Gen. 8:11). It is mentioned among the
      most notable trees of Palestine, where it was cultivated
      long before the time of the Hebrews (Deut. 6:11; 8:8). It
      is mentioned in the first Old Testament parable, that of
      Jotham (Judg. 9:9), and is named among the blessings of the
      &quot;good land,&quot; and is at the present day the one
      characteristic tree of Palestine. The oldest olive-trees in
      the country are those which are enclosed in the Garden of
      Gethsemane. It is referred to as an emblem of prosperity
      and beauty and religious privilege (Ps. 52:8; Jer. 11:16;
      Hos. 14:6). The two &quot;witnesses&quot; mentioned in Rev.
      11:4 are spoken of as &quot;two olive trees standing before
      the God of the earth.&quot; (Comp. Zech. 4:3, 11-14.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;olive-tree, wild by nature&quot; (Rom. 11:24), is
      the shoot or cutting of the good olive-tree which, left
      ungrafted, grows up to be a &quot;wild olive.&quot; In Rom.
      11:17 Paul refers to the practice of grafting shoots of the
      wild olive into a &quot;good&quot; olive which has become
      unfruitful. By such a process the sap of the good olive, by
      pervading the branch which is &quot;graffed in,&quot; makes
      it a good branch, bearing good olives. Thus the Gentiles,
      being a &quot;wild olive,&quot; but now &quot;graffed
      in,&quot; yield fruit, but only through the sap of the tree
      into which they have been graffed. This is a process
      &quot;contrary to nature&quot; (11:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002780"><b>Olves, Mount of -</b> so called from
      the olive trees with which its sides are clothed, is a
      mountain ridge on the east of Jerusalem (1 Kings 11:7;
      Ezek. 11:23; Zech. 14:4), from which it is separated by the
      valley of Kidron. It is first mentioned in connection with
      David&#39;s flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of
      Absalom (2 Sam. 15:30), and is only once again mentioned in
      the Old Testament, in Zech. 14:4. It is, however,
      frequently alluded to (1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:13; Neh.
      8:15; Ezek. 11:23).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (Matt.
      21:1; 26:30, etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur,
      i.e., &quot;Mount of the Summit;&quot; also sometimes
      called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., &quot;Mount of Olives.&quot;
      It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road
      from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount.
      It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over
      Jerusalem. &quot;No name in Scripture,&quot; says Dr.
      Porter, &quot;calls up associations at once so sacred and
      so pleasing as that of Olivet. The &#39;mount&#39; is so
      intimately connected with the private, the devotional life
      of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with
      feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often
      sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet
      to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the
      sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his
      followers (Matt. 24). Here he gave them the beautiful
      parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here
      he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and
      prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the
      labours and trials of the day (Luke 21:37); and here he
      came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful
      prayer, &#39;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
      pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou
      wilt&#39; (Matt. 26:39). And when the cup of God&#39;s
      wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he
      led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to
      Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven
      (Luke 24:50, 51; Acts 1:12).&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or
      peaks: (1) the &quot;Galilee&quot; peak, so called from a
      tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the
      disciples (Acts 1:11); (2) the &quot;Mount of
      Ascension,&quot; the supposed site of that event, which
      was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany (Luke
      24:51, 52); (3) the &quot;Prophets,&quot; from the
      catacombs on its side, called &quot;the prophets&#39;
      tombs;&quot; and (4) the &quot;Mount of Corruption,&quot;
      so called because of the &quot;high places&quot; erected
      there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign
      wives (1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:13; Vulg., &quot;Mount of
      Offence&quot;).

      Omri, his captain, was made king (B.C. 931). For four years
      there was continued opposition to his reign, Tibni, another
      claimant to the throne, leading the opposing party; but at
      the close of that period all his rivals were defeated, and
      he became king of Israel, &quot;Tibni died and Omri
      reigned&quot; (B.C. 927). By his vigour and power he gained
      great eminence and consolidated the kingdom. He fixed his
      dynasty on the throne so firmly that it continued during
      four succeeding reigns. Tirza was for six years the seat of
      his government. He then removed the capital to Samaria
      (q.v.), where he died, and was succeeded by his son Ahab.
      &quot;He wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did
      worse than all that were before him.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      Beth-omri, &quot;the house&quot; or &quot;city of

      &quot;Moabite stone&quot;), which was erected in Moab about
      twenty or thirty years after Omri&#39;s death, it is
      recorded that Omri oppressed Moab till Mesha delivered the
      land: &quot;Omri, king of Israel, oppressed Moab many days,
      for Chemosh was angry with his land. His son succeeded him,
      and he also said, I will oppress Moab&quot; (comp. 2 Kings
      1:1; 3:4, 5). The &quot;Moabite stone&quot; also records
      that &quot;Omri took the land of Medeba, and occupied it in
      his day and in the days of his son forty years.&quot;

      (Jer. 43:13) and Aven (Ezek. 30:17), stood on the east bank
      of the Nile, a few miles north of Memphis, and near Cairo,
      in the north-east. The Vulgate and the LXX. Versions have
      &quot;Heliopolis&quot; (&quot;city of the sun&quot;)
      instead of On in Genesis and of Aven in Ezekiel. The
      &quot;city of destruction&quot; Isaiah speaks of (19:18,
      marg. &quot;of Heres;&quot; Heb. &#39;Ir-ha-heres, which
      some MSS. read Ir-ha-heres, i.e., &quot;city of the
      sun&quot;) may be the name given to On, the prophecy being
      that the time will come when that city which was known as
      the &quot;city of the sun-god&quot; shall become the
      &quot;city of destruction&quot; of the sun-god, i.e., when
      idolatry shall cease, and the worship of the true God be
      established.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated
      to the sun. Of these only one now remains standing.
      &quot;Cleopatra&#39;s Needle&quot; was one of those which
      stood in this city in front of the Temple of Tum, i.e.,

      his name. In it he beseeches Philemon to receive his slave
      as a &quot;faithful and beloved brother.&quot; Paul offers
      to pay to Philemon anything his slave had taken, and to
      bear the wrong he had done him. He was accompanied on his

      The story of this fugitive Colossian slave is a remarkable
      evidence of the freedom of access to the prisoner which was

      of the Palestine Exploration Fund at the south-eastern
      angle of the temple area. It is 4 feet below the present
      surface. In 2 Kings 5:24 this word is translated
      &quot;tower&quot; (R.V., &quot;hill&quot;), denoting
      probably some eminence near Elisha&#39;s house.</a>

      <a name="T0002796"><b>Ophir -</b> (1.) One of the sons of
      Joktan (Gen. 10:29).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Some region famous for its gold (1 Kings 9:28; 10:11;
      22:48; Job 22:24; 28:16; Isa. 13:12). In the LXX. this word
      is rendered &quot;Sophir,&quot; and &quot;Sofir&quot; is
      the Coptic name for India, which is the rendering of the
      Arabic version, as also of the Vulgate. Josephus has
      identified it with the Golden Chersonese, i.e., the Malay
      peninsula. It is now generally identified with Abhira, at
      the mouth of the Indus. Much may be said, however, in
      favour of the opinion that it was somewhere in Arabia.

      <a name="T0002797"><b>Ophni -</b> mouldy, a city of
      Benjamin (Josh. 18:24).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002798"><b>Ophrah -</b> a fawn. 1 Chr. 4:14.
      (1.) A city of Benjamin (Josh. 18:23); probably identical
      with Ephron (2 Chr. 13:19) and Ephraim (John 11:54).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) &quot;Of the Abi-ezrites.&quot; A city of Manasseh, 6
      miles south-west of Shechem, the residence of Gideon (Judg.
      6:11; 8:27, 32). After his great victory over the
      Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings
      (8:18-21). He then assumed the function of high priest, and
      sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This
      thing &quot;became a snare&quot; to Gideon and his house.
      After Gideon&#39;s death his family resided here till they
      were put to death by Abimelech (Judg. 9:5). It is
      identified with Ferata.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002799"><b>Oracle -</b> In the Old Testament
      used in every case, except 2 Sam. 16:23, to denote the most
      holy place in the temple (1 Kings 6:5, 19-23; 8:6). In 2
      Sam. 16:23 it means the Word of God. A man inquired
      &quot;at the oracle of God&quot; by means of the Urim and
      Thummim in the breastplate on the high priest&#39;s ephod.
      In the New Testament it is used only in the plural, and
      always denotes the Word of God (Rom. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, etc.).
      The Scriptures are called &quot;living oracles&quot; (comp.
      Heb. 4:12) because of their quickening power (Acts 7:38).
