      who, being defeated by Gideon and put to straits, was slain
      along with Zeeb (Judg. 7:20-25). Many of the Midianites
      perished along with him (Ps. 83:9; Isa. 10:26).</a>

      where Gideon slew Oreb after the defeat of the Midianites
      (Judg. 7:25; Isa. 10:26). It was probably the place now
      called Orbo, on the east of Jordan, near Bethshean.</a>

      instrument, probably a kind of Pan&#39;s pipes (Gen. 4:21;
      Job 21:12; Ps. 150:4), which consisted of seven or eight
      reeds of unequal length.</a>

      &quot;the fool&quot;, the name of a constellation (Job 9:9;
      38:31; Amos 5:8) consisting of about eighty stars. The
      Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX. renders by Hesperus,
      i.e., &quot;the evening-star,&quot; Venus. The Orientals
      &quot;appear to have conceived of this constellation under
      the figure of an impious giant bound upon the sky.&quot;
      This giant was, according to tradition, Nimrod, the type of
      the folly that contends against God. In Isa. 13:10 the
      plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered
      &quot;constellations.&quot;</a>

      death of her husband she accompanied Naomi, her
      mother-in-law, part of the way to Bethlehem, and then
      returned to Moab.</a>

      <a name="T0002807"><b>Orphans -</b> (Lam. 5:3), i.e.,
      desolate and without protectors. The word occurs only here.
      In John 14:18 the word there rendered
      &quot;comfortless&quot; (R.V., &quot;desolate;&quot; marg.,
      &quot;orphans&quot;) properly means &quot;orphans.&quot;
      The same Greek word is rendered &quot;fatherless&quot; in
      James 1:27.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002808"><b>Osprey -</b> Heb. &#39;ozniyyah, an
      unclean bird according to the Mosaic law (Lev. 11:13; Deut.
      14:12); the fish-eating eagle (Pandion haliaetus); one of
      the lesser eagles. But the Hebrew word may be taken to
      denote the short-toed eagle (Circaetus gallicus of Southern
      Europe), one of the most abundant of the eagle tribe found
      in Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002809"><b>Ossifrage -</b> Heb. peres = to
      &quot;break&quot; or &quot;crush&quot;, the lammer-geier,
      or bearded vulture, the largest of the whole vulture tribe.
      It was an unclean bird (Lev. 11:13; Deut. 14:12). It is not
      a gregarious bird, and is found but rarely in Palestine.
      &quot;When the other vultures have picked the flesh off any
      animal, he comes in at the end of the feast, and swallows
      the bones, or breaks them, and swallows the pieces if he
      cannot otherwise extract the marrow. The bones he cracks
      [hence the appropriateness of the name ossifrage, i.e.,
      &quot;bone-breaker&quot;] by letting them fall on a rock
      from a great height. He does not, however, confine himself
      to these delicacies, but whenever he has an opportunity
      will devour lambs, kids, or hares. These he generally
      obtains by pushing them over cliffs, when he has watched
      his opportunity; and he has been known to attack men while
      climbing rocks, and dash them against the bottom. But
      tortoises and serpents are his ordinary food...No doubt it
      was a lammer-geier that mistook the bald head of the poet
      AEschylus for a stone, and dropped on it the tortoise which
      killed him&quot; (Tristram&#39;s Nat. Hist.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002810"><b>Ostrich -</b> (Lam. 4:3), the
      rendering of Hebrew pl. enim; so called from its greediness
      and gluttony. The allusion here is to the habit of the
      ostrich with reference to its eggs, which is thus
      described: &quot;The outer layer of eggs is generally so
      ill covered that they are destroyed in quantities by
      jackals, wild-cats, etc., and that the natives carry them
      away, only taking care not to leave the marks of their
      footsteps, since, when the ostrich comes and finds that her
      nest is discovered, she crushes the whole brood, and builds
      a nest elsewhere.&quot; In Job 39:13 this word in the
      Authorized Version is the rendering of a Hebrew word
      (notsah) which means &quot;feathers,&quot; as in the
      Revised Version. In the same verse the word
      &quot;peacocks&quot; of the Authorized Version is the
      rendering of the Hebrew pl. renanim, properly meaning
      &quot;ostriches,&quot; as in the Revised Version. (See OWL
      &macr;T0002815 [1].)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002811"><b>Othni -</b> a lion of Jehovah, a son
      of Shemaiah, and one of the temple porters in the time of
      David (1 Chr. 26:7). He was a &quot;mighty man of
      valour.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002812"><b>Othniel -</b> lion of God, the first
      of the judges. His wife Achsah was the daughter of Caleb
      (Josh. 15:16, 17; Judg. 1:13). He gained her hand as a
      reward for his bravery in leading a successful expedition
      against Debir (q.v.). Some thirty years after the death of
      Joshua, the Israelites fell under the subjection of
      Chushan-rishathaim (q.v.), the king of Mesopotamia. He
      oppressed them for full eight years, when they
      &quot;cried&quot; unto Jehovah, and Othniel was raised up
      to be their deliverer. He was the younger brother of Caleb
      (Judg. 3:8, 9-11). He is the only judge mentioned connected
      with the tribe of Judah. Under him the land had rest forty
      years.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002813"><b>Ouches -</b> an Old English word
      denoting cavities or sockets in which gems were set (Ex.
      28:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002814"><b>Oven -</b> Heb. tannur, (Hos. 7:4).
      In towns there appear to have been public ovens. There was
      a street in Jerusalem (Jer. 37:21) called &quot;bakers&#39;
      street&quot; (the only case in which the name of a street
      in Jerusalem is preserved). The words &quot;tower of the
      furnaces&quot; (Neh. 3:11; 12:38) is more properly
      &quot;tower of the ovens&quot; (Heb. tannurim). These
      resemble the ovens in use among ourselves.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other private ovens of different kinds. Some
      were like large jars made of earthenware or copper, which
      were heated inside with wood (1 Kings 17:12; Isa. 44:15;
      Jer. 7:18) or grass (Matt. 6:30), and when the fire had
      burned out, small pieces of dough were placed inside or
      spread in thin layers on the outside, and were thus baked.
      (See <a href=

      FURNACE</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Pits were also formed for the same purposes, and lined with
      cement. These were used after the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heated stones, or sand heated by a fire heaped over it, and
      also flat irons pans, all served as ovens for the
      preparation of bread. (See Gen. 18:6; 1 Kings 19:6.)

    <p>
      <a name="T0002815"><b>Owl -</b> (1.) Heb.
      bath-haya&#39;anah, &quot;daughter of greediness&quot; or
      of &quot;shouting.&quot; In the list of unclean birds (Lev.
      11:16; Deut. 14:15); also mentioned in Job 30:29; Isa.
      13:21; 34:13; 43:20; Jer. 50:39; Micah 1:8. In all these
      passages the Revised Version translates &quot;ostrich&quot;
      (q.v.), which is the correct rendering.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. yanshuph, rendered &quot;great owl&quot; in Lev.
      11:17; Deut. 14:16, and &quot;owl&quot; in Isa. 34:11. This
      is supposed to be the Egyptian eagle-owl (Bubo ascalaphus),
      which takes the place of the eagle-owl (Bubo maximus) found
      in Southern Europe. It is found frequenting the ruins of
      Egypt and also of the Holy Land. &quot;Its cry is a loud,
      prolonged, and very powerful hoot. I know nothing which
      more vividly brought to my mind the sense of desolation and
      loneliness than the re-echoing hoot of two or three of
      these great owls as I stood at midnight among the ruined
      temples of Baalbek&quot; (Tristram).
    </p>
    <p>
      The LXX. and Vulgate render this word by &quot;ibis&quot;,
      i.e., the Egyptian heron.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. kos, rendered &quot;little owl&quot; in Lev.
      11:17; Deut. 14:16, and &quot;owl&quot; in Ps. 102:6. The
      Arabs call this bird &quot;the mother of ruins.&quot; It is
      by far the most common of all the owls of Palestine. It is
      the Athene persica, the bird of Minerva, the symbol of
      ancient Athens.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. kippoz, the &quot;great owl&quot; (Isa. 34:15);
      Revised Version, &quot;arrow-snake;&quot; LXX. and Vulgate,
      &quot;hedgehog,&quot; reading in the text, kippod, instead
      of kippoz. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of
      the rendering of the Authorized Version. Tristram says:
      &quot;The word [i.e., kippoz] is very possibly an imitation
      of the cry of the scops owl (Scops giu), which is very
      common among ruins, caves, and old walls of towns...It is a
      migrant, returning to Palestine in spring.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Heb. lilith, &quot;screech owl&quot; (Isa. 34:14,
      marg. and R.V., &quot;night monster&quot;). The Hebrew word
      is from a root signifying &quot;night.&quot; Some species
      of the owl is obviously intended by this word. It may be
      the hooting or tawny owl (Syrnium aluco), which is common
      in Egypt and in many parts of Palestine. This verse in
      Isaiah is &quot;descriptive of utter and perpetual
      desolation, of a land that should be full of ruins, and
      inhabited by the animals that usually make such ruins their
      abode.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002816"><b>Ox -</b> Heb. bakar,
      &quot;cattle;&quot; &quot;neat cattle&quot;, (Gen. 12:16;
      34:28; Job 1:3, 14; 42:12, etc.); not to be muzzled when
      treading the corn (Deut. 25:4). Referred to by our Lord in
      his reproof to the Pharisees (Luke 13:15; 14:5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002817"><b>Ox goad -</b> mentioned only in Judg.
      3:31, the weapon with which Shamgar (q.v.) slew six hundred
      Philistines. &quot;The ploughman still carries his goad, a
      weapon apparently more fitted for the hand of the soldier
      than the peaceful husbandman. The one I saw was of the
      &#39;oak of Bashan,&#39; and measured upwards of ten feet
      in length. At one end was an iron spear, and at the other a
      piece of the same metal flattened. One can well understand
      how a warrior might use such a weapon with effect in the
      battle-field&quot; (Porter&#39;s Syria, etc.). (See <a

      face and the eyes seems to have been common (Jer. 4:30;
      Ezek. 23:40). An allusion to this practice is found in the
      name of Job&#39;s daughter (42:14) Kerenhappuch (q.v.).
      Paintings in the modern sense of the word were unknown to
      the ancient Jews.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002827"><b>Palace -</b> Used now only of royal
      dwellings, although originally meaning simply (as the Latin
      word palatium, from which it is derived, shows) a building
      surrounded by a fence or a paling. In the Authorized
      Version there are many different words so rendered,
      presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or
      lofty fortress or royal residence (Neh. 1:1; Dan. 8:2). It
      is the name given to the temple fortress (Neh. 2:8) and to
      the temple itself (1 Chr. 29:1). It denotes also a spacious
      building or a great house (Dan. 1:4; 4:4, 29: Esther 1:5;
      7:7), and a fortified place or an enclosure (Ezek. 25:4).
      Solomon&#39;s palace is described in 1 Kings 7:1-12 as a
      series of buildings rather than a single great structure.
      Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace
      stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the
      south.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament it designates the official residence
      of Pilate or that of the high priest (Matt. 26:3, 58, 69;
      Mark 14:54, 66; John 18:15). In Phil. 1:13 this word is the
      rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian
      cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was
      continually chained to a soldier of that corps (Acts
      28:16), and hence his name and sufferings became known in
      all the praetorium. The &quot;soldiers that kept&quot; him
      would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread
      the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some,
      however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within
      the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a
      detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as
      the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of
      Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;In the chambers which were occupied as
      guard-rooms,&quot; says Dr. Manning, &quot;by the
      praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude
      caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls,
      just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part
      of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed
      upon a cross. To add to the &#39;offence of the cross,&#39;
      the crucified one is represented with the head of an
      animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the
      figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the
      attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt,
      ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his god. It
      can scarcely be doubted that we have here a contemporary
      caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard,
      ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade.&quot;

      only the sea-coast of the land of Canaan inhabited by the
      Philistines (Ex. 15:14; Isa. 14:29, 31; Joel 3:4), and in
      this sense exclusively the Hebrew name Pelesheth (rendered
      &quot;Philistia&quot; in Ps. 60:8; 83:7; 87:4; 108:9)
      occurs in the Old Testament.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till a late period in Jewish history was this name used
      to denote &quot;the land of the Hebrews&quot; in general
      (Gen. 40:15). It is also called &quot;the holy land&quot;
      (Zech. 2:12), the &quot;land of Jehovah&quot; (Hos. 9:3;
      Ps. 85:1), the &quot;land of promise&quot; (Heb. 11:9),
      because promised to Abraham (Gen. 12:7; 24:7), the
      &quot;land of Canaan&quot; (Gen. 12:5), the &quot;land of
      Israel&quot; (1 Sam. 13:19), and the &quot;land of
      Judah&quot; (Isa. 19:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The territory promised as an inheritance to the seed of
      Abraham (Gen. 15:18-21; Num. 34:1-12) was bounded on the
      east by the river Euphrates, on the west by the
      Mediterranean, on the north by the &quot;entrance of
      Hamath,&quot; and on the south by the &quot;river of
      Egypt.&quot; This extent of territory, about 60,000 square
      miles, was at length conquered by David, and was ruled over
      also by his son Solomon (2 Sam. 8; 1 Chr. 18; 1 Kings 4:1,
      21). This vast empire was the Promised Land; but Palestine
      was only a part of it, terminating in the north at the
      southern extremity of the Lebanon range, and in the south
      in the wilderness of Paran, thus extending in all to about
      144 miles in length. Its average breadth was about 60 miles
      from the Mediterranean on the west to beyond the Jordan. It
      has fittingly been designated &quot;the least of all
      lands.&quot; Western Palestine, on the south of Gaza, is
      only about 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean to
      the Dead Sea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where
      it is only 20 miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palestine, &quot;set in the midst&quot; (Ezek. 5:5) of all
      other lands, is the most remarkable country on the face of
      the earth. No single country of such an extent has so great
      a variety of climate, and hence also of plant and animal
      life. Moses describes it as &quot;a good land, a land of
      brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
      valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines,
      and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and
      honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat bread without
      scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land
      whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest
      dig brass&quot; (Deut. 8:7-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;In the time of Christ the country looked, in all
      probability, much as now. The whole land consists of
      rounded limestone hills, fretted into countless stony
      valleys, offering but rarely level tracts, of which
      Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is large enough to be seen
      on the map. The original woods had for ages disappeared,
      though the slopes were dotted, as now, with figs, olives,
      and other fruit-trees where there was any soil. Permanent
      streams were even then unknown, the passing rush of winter
      torrents being all that was seen among the hills. The
      autumn and spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out
      like huge underground jars in the soft limestone, with
      artificial mud-banked ponds still found near all villages,
      furnished water. Hills now bare, or at best rough with
      stunted growth, were then terraced, so as to grow vines,
      olives, and grain. To-day almost desolate, the country then
      teemed with population. Wine-presses cut in the rocks,
      endless terraces, and the ruins of old vineyard towers are
      now found amidst solitudes overgrown for ages with thorns
      and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poor gnarled
      scrub&quot; (Geikie&#39;s Life of Christ).
    </p>
    <p>
      From an early period the land was inhabited by the
      descendants of Canaan, who retained possession of the whole
      land &quot;from Sidon to Gaza&quot; till the time of the
      conquest by Joshua, when it was occupied by the twelve
      tribes. Two tribes and a half had their allotments given
      them by Moses on the east of the Jordan (Deut. 3:12-20;
      comp. Num. 1:17-46; Josh. 4:12-13). The remaining tribes
      had their portion on the west of Jordan.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four hundred
      years, the people were governed by judges. For a period of
      one hundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity
      while it was ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the
      death of Solomon, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne; but
      his conduct was such that ten of the tribes revolted, and
      formed an independent monarchy, called the kingdom of
      Israel, or the northern kingdom, the capital of which was
      first Shechem and afterwards Samaria. This kingdom was
      destroyed. The Israelites were carried captive by
      Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, B.C. 722, after an
      independent existence of two hundred and fifty-three years.
      The place of the captives carried away was supplied by
      tribes brought from the east, and thus was formed the
      Samaritan nation (2 Kings 17:24-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nebuchadnezzar came up against the kingdom of the two
      tribes, the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which was
      Jerusalem, one hundred and thirty-four years after the
      overthrow of the kingdom of Israel. He overthrew the city,
      plundered the temple, and carried the people into captivity
      to Babylon (B.C. 587), where they remained seventy years.
      At the close of the period of the Captivity, they returned
      to their own land, under the edict of Cyrus (Ezra 1:1-4).
      They rebuilt the city and temple, and restored the old
      Jewish commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while after the Restoration the Jews were ruled by
      Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by the high
      priests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of
      Alexander the Great at Babylon (B.C. 323), his vast empire
      was divided between his four generals. Egypt, Arabia,
      Palestine, and Coele-Syria fell to the lot of Ptolemy
      Lagus. Ptolemy took possession of Palestine in B.C. 320,
      and carried nearly one hundred thousand of the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem into Egypt. He made Alexandria the capital of
      his kingdom, and treated the Jews with consideration,
      confirming them in the enjoyment of many privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      After suffering persecution at the hands of Ptolemy&#39;s
      successors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and
      became subject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria.
      The cruelty and opression of the successors of Antiochus at
      length led to the revolt under the Maccabees (B.C. 163),
      when they threw off the Syrian yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the
      Great to a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in
      ruins, and massacred some twelve thousand of the
      inhabitants. He left the temple, however, unijured. About
      twenty-five years after this the Jews revolted and cast off
      the Roman yoke. They were however, subdued by Herod the
      Great (q.v.). The city and the temple were destroyed, and
      many of the inhabitants were put to death. About B.C. 20,
      Herod proceeded to rebuild the city and restore the ruined
      temple, which in about nine years and a half was so far
      completed that the sacred services could be resumed in it
      (comp. John 2:20). He was succeeded by his son Archelaus,
      who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D.
      6, when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman
      governors or procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of
      these procurators. He was appointed to his office A.D. 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of Herod the Great
      comprehended the whole of the country originally divided
      among the twelve tribes, which he divided into four
      provinces or districts. This division was recognized so
      long as Palestine was under the Roman dominion. These four
      provinces were, (1) Judea, the southern portion of the
      country; (2) Samaria, the middle province, the northern
      boundary of which ran along the hills to the south of the
      plain of Esdraelon; (3) Galilee, the northern province; and
      (4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the &quot;opposite
      country&quot;), the country lying east of the Jordan and
      the Dead Sea. This province was subdivided into these
      districts, (1) Peraea proper, lying between the rivers
      Arnon and Jabbok; (2) Galaaditis (Gilead); (3) Batanaea;
      (4) Gaulonitis (Jaulan); (5) Ituraea or Auranitis, the
      ancient Bashan; (6) Trachonitis; (7) Abilene; (8)
      Decapolis, i.e., the region of the ten cities. The whole
      territory of Palestine, including the portions alloted to
      the trans-Jordan tribes, extended to about eleven thousand
      square miles. Recent exploration has shown the territory on
      the west of Jordan alone to be six thousand square miles in
      extent, the size of the principality of Wales.

      English word may denote either a caterpillar (as rendered
      by the LXX.), which wanders like a palmer or pilgrim, or
      which travels like pilgrims in bands (Joel 1:4; 2:25), the
      wingless locusts, or the migratory locust in its larva
      state.</a>

      <a name="T0002831"><b>Palm tree -</b> (Heb. tamar), the
      date-palm characteristic of Palestine. It is described as
      &quot;flourishing&quot; (Ps. 92:12), tall (Cant. 7:7),
      &quot;upright&quot; (Jer. 10:5). Its branches are a symbol
      of victory (Rev. 7:9). &quot;Rising with slender stem 40 or
      50, at times even 80, feet aloft, its only branches, the
      feathery, snow-like, pale-green fronds from 6 to 12 feet
      long, bending from its top, the palm attracts the eye
      wherever it is seen.&quot; The whole land of Palestine was
      called by the Greeks and Romans Phoenicia, i.e., &quot;the
      land of palms.&quot; Tadmor in the desert was called by the
      Greeks and Romans Palmyra, i.e., &quot;the city of
      palms.&quot; The finest specimens of this tree grew at
      Jericho (Deut. 34:3) and Engedi and along the banks of the
      Jordan. Branches of the palm tree were carried at the feast
      of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:40). At our Lord&#39;s triumphal
      entrance into Jerusalem the crowds took palm branches, and
      went forth to meet him, crying, &quot;Hosanna: Blessed is
      the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the
      Lord&quot; (Matt. 21:8; John 12:13). (See <a href=

      loosing from Paphos, sailed north-west and came to Perga,
      the capital of Pamphylia (Acts 13:13, 14), a province about
      the middle of the southern sea-board of Asia Minor. It lay
      between Lycia on the west and Cilicia on the east. There

      frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old Testament
      (Lev. 2:5; 6:21; Num. 11:8; 1 Sam. 2:14, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;ash-pans&quot; mentioned in Ex. 27:3 were made of
      copper, and were used in connection with the altar of
      burnt-offering. The &quot;iron pan&quot; mentioned in Ezek.
      4:3 (marg., &quot;flat plate &quot; or &quot;slice&quot;)
      was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The
      &quot;fire-pans&quot; of Ex. 27:3 were fire-shovels used
      for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered
      &quot;snuff-dishes&quot; (25:38; 37:23) and
      &quot;censers&quot; (Lev. 10:1; 16:12; Num. 4:14, etc.).
      These were probably simply metal vessels employed for
      carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar
      of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;frying-pan&quot; mentioned in Lev. 2:7; 7:9 was a
      pot for boiling.

      <a name="T0002839"><b>Pannag -</b> (Ezek. 27:17; marg.
      R.V., &quot;perhaps a kind of confection&quot;) the Jews
      explain as the name of a kind of sweet pastry. Others take
      it as the name of some place, identifying it with Pingi, on
      the road between Damascus and Baalbec. &quot;Pannaga&quot;
      is the Sanscrit name of an aromatic plant (comp. Gen.
      43:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002840"><b>Paper -</b> The expression in the
      Authorized Version (Isa. 19:7), &quot;the paper reeds by
      the brooks,&quot; is in the Revised Version more correctly
      &quot;the meadows by the Nile.&quot; The words undoubtedly
      refer to a grassy place on the banks of the Nile fit for
      pasturage.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2 John 1:12 the word is used in its proper sense. The
      material so referred to was manufactured from the papyrus,
      and hence its name. The papyrus (Heb. gome) was a kind of
      bulrush (q.v.). It is mentioned by Job (8:11) and Isaiah
      (35:7). It was used for many purposes. This plant (Papyrus
      Nilotica) is now unknown in Egypt; no trace of it can be
      found. The unaccountable disappearance of this plant from
      Egypt was foretold by Isaiah (19:6, 7) as a part of the
      divine judgment on that land. The most extensive papyrus
      growths now known are in the marshes at the northern end of
      the lake of Merom.

      <a name="T0002841"><b>Paphos -</b> the capital of the

      governor. It was visited by Paul and Barnabas on their
      first missionary tour (Acts 13:6). It is new Paphos which
      is here meant. It lay on the west coast of the island,
      about 8 miles north of old Paphos. Its modern name is
      Baffa.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002842"><b>Parable -</b> (Gr. parabole), a
      placing beside; a comparison; equivalent to the Heb.
      mashal, a similitude. In the Old Testament this is used to
      denote (1) a proverb (1 Sam. 10:12; 24:13; 2 Chr. 7:20),
      (2) a prophetic utterance (Num. 23:7; Ezek. 20:49), (3) an
      enigmatic saying (Ps. 78:2; Prov. 1:6). In the New
      Testament, (1) a proverb (Mark 7:17; Luke 4:23), (2) a
      typical emblem (Heb. 9:9; 11:19), (3) a similitude or
      allegory (Matt. 15:15; 24:32; Mark 3:23; Luke 5:36; 14:7);
      (4) ordinarily, in a more restricted sense, a comparison of
      earthly with heavenly things, &quot;an earthly story with a
      heavenly meaning,&quot; as in the parables of our Lord.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Instruction by parables has been in use from the earliest
      times. A large portion of our Lord&#39;s public teaching
      consisted of parables. He himself explains his reasons for
      this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples,
      &quot;Why speakest thou to them in parables?&quot; (Matt.
      13:13-15; Mark 4:11, 12; Luke 8:9, 10). He followed in so
      doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in
      Matt. 13:13.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parables uttered by our Lord are all recorded in the
      synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The fourth
      Gospel contains no parable properly so called, although the
      illustration of the good shepherd (John 10:1-16) has all
      the essential features of a parable. (See List of Parables
      in Appendix.)

    <p>
      <a name="T0002843"><b>Paradise -</b> a Persian word
      (pardes), properly meaning a &quot;pleasure-ground&quot; or

      for the world of happiness and rest hereafter (Luke 23:43;
      2 Cor. 12:4; Rev. 2:7). For &quot;garden&quot; in Gen. 2:8

      between the &#39;Arabah on the east and the wilderness of
      Shur on the west. It is intersected in a north-western
      direction by the Wady el-&#39;Arish. It bears the modern
      name of Badiet et-Tih, i.e., &quot;the desert of the
      wanderings.&quot; This district, through which the children
      of Israel wandered, lay three days&#39; march from Sinai
      (Num. 10:12, 33). From Kadesh, in this wilderness, spies
      (q.v.) were sent to spy the land (13:3, 26). Here, long
      afterwards, David found refuge from Saul (1 Sam. 25:1,

      granted freely (Isa. 43:25), readily (Neh. 9:17; Ps. 86:5),

      sovereign, in pure sovereignty, granting simply a remission
      of the penalty due to sin, but securing neither honour nor
      reward to the pardoned. Justification (q.v.), on the other
      hand, is the act of a judge, and not of a sovereign, and
      includes pardon and, at the same time, a title to all the
      rewards and blessings promised in the covenant of life.</a>

      word so rendered. It corresponds to what the Turks call a
      kiosk, as in Judg. 3:20 (the &quot;summer parlour&quot;),
      or as in the margin of the Revised Version (&quot;the upper
      chamber of cooling&quot;), a small room built on the roof
      of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and
      having a door communicating with the outside by which
      persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon
      was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of
      having a message from God to him, was admitted into his

      In Jer. 17:11 the prophet is illustrating the fact that
      riches unlawfully acquired are precarious and short-lived.
      The exact nature of the illustration cannot be precisely
      determined. Some interpret the words as meaning that the
      covetous man will be as surely disappointed as the
      partridge which gathers in eggs, not of her own laying, and
      is unable to hatch them; others (Tristram), with more
      probability, as denoting that the man who enriches himself
      by unjust means &quot;will as surely be disappointed as the
      partridge which commences to sit, but is speedily robbed of
      her hopes of a brood&quot; by her eggs being stolen away
      from her.

      The commonest partridge in Palestine is the Caccabis
      saxatilis, the Greek partridge. The partridge of the
      wilderness (Ammo-perdix heyi) is a smaller species. Both
      are essentially mountain and rock birds, thus differing
      from the English partridge, which loves cultivated fields.

      head of one of the priestly courses, was &quot;chief
      governor [Heb. paqid nagid, meaning &quot;deputy
      governor&quot;] of the temple&quot; (Jer. 20:1, 2). At this
      time the <i>nagid</i>, or &quot;governor,&quot; of the
      temple was Seraiah the high priest (1 Chr. 6:14), and
      Pashur was his <i>paqid</i>, or &quot;deputy.&quot; Enraged
      at the plainness with which Jeremiah uttered his solemn
      warnings of coming judgements, because of the abounding
      iniquity of the times, Pashur ordered the temple police to
      seize him, and after inflicting on him corporal punishment
      (forty stripes save one, Deut. 25:3; comp. 2 Cor. 11:24),
      to put him in the stocks in the high gate of Benjamin,
      where he remained all night. On being set free in the
      morning, Jeremiah went to Pashur (Jer. 20:3, 5), and
      announced to him that God had changed his name to
      Magor-missabib, i.e., &quot;terror on every side.&quot; The
      punishment that fell upon him was probably remorse, when he
      saw the ruin he had brought upon his country by advising a
      close alliance with Egypt in opposition to the counsels of
      Jeremiah (20:4-6). He was carried captive to Babylon, and
      died there.</a>

      designating the position of the great altar erected by the
      eastern tribes on their return home. This word also
      designates the fords of the Jordan to the south of the Sea

      Sam. 13:23; 14:4). &quot;Passages&quot; in Jer. 22:20 is in

      <a name="T0002864"><b>Passover -</b> the name given to the
      chief of the three great historical annual festivals of the
      Jews. It was kept in remembrance of the Lord&#39;s passing
      over the houses of the Israelites (Ex. 12:13) when the
      first born of all the Egyptians were destroyed. It is
      called also the &quot;feast of unleavened bread&quot; (Ex.
      23:15; Mark 14:1; Acts 12:3), because during its
      celebration no leavened bread was to be eaten or even kept
      in the household (Ex. 12:15). The word afterwards came to
      denote the lamb that was slain at the feast (Mark 14:12-14;
      1 Cor. 5:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A detailed account of the institution of this feast is
      given in Ex. 12 and 13. It was afterwards incorporated in
      the ceremonial law (Lev. 23:4-8) as one of the great
      festivals of the nation. In after times many changes seem
      to have taken place as to the mode of its celebration as
      compared with its first celebration (comp. Deut. 16:2, 5,
      6; 2 Chr. 30:16; Lev. 23:10-14; Num. 9:10, 11; 28:16-24).
      Again, the use of wine (Luke 22:17, 20), of sauce with the
      bitter herbs (John 13:26), and the service of praise were
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is recorded only one celebration of this feast
      between the Exodus and the entrance into Canaan, namely,
      that mentioned in Num. 9:5. (See <a href=

      JOSIAH</a>.) It was primarily a commemorative ordinance,
      reminding the children of Israel of their deliverance out
      of Egypt; but it was, no doubt, also a type of the great
      deliverance wrought by the Messiah for all his people from
      the doom of death on account of sin, and from the bondage
      of sin itself, a worse than Egyptian bondage (1 Cor. 5:7;
      John 1:29; 19:32-36; 1 Pet. 1:19; Gal. 4:4, 5). The
      appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in
      the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described: &quot;The
      city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more
      crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and
      dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all
      nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy.
      Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for
      in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with
      pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings.
      Sellers shouted the merits of their beasts, sheep bleated,
      oxen lowed. Sellers of doves also had a place set apart for
      them. Potters offered a choice from huge stacks of clay
      dishes and ovens for roasting and eating the Passover lamb.
      Booths for wine, oil, salt, and all else needed for
      sacrifices invited customers. Persons going to and from the
      city shortened their journey by crossing the temple
      grounds, often carrying burdens...Stalls to change foreign
      money into the shekel of the temple, which alone could be
      paid to the priests, were numerous, the whole confusion
      making the sanctuary like a noisy market&quot;

      sons of Jacob (Acts 7:8, 9), and to David (2:29). This name
      is generally applied to the progenitors of families or
      &quot;heads of the fathers&quot; (Josh. 14:1) mentioned in
      Scripture, and they are spoken of as antediluvian (from
      Adam to Noah) and post-diluvian (from Noah to Jacob)
      patriachs. But the expression &quot;the patriarch,&quot; by
      way of eminence, is applied to the twelve sons of Jacob, or
      to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</a>

      &quot;Patriachal longevity presents itself as one of the
      most striking of the facts concerning mankind which the
      early history of the Book of Genesis places before
      us...There is a large amount of consentient tradition to
      the effect that the life of man was originally far more
      prolonged than it is at present, extending to at least
      several hundred years. The Babylonians, Egyptians, and
      Chinese exaggerated these hundreds into thousands. The
      Greeks and Romans, with more moderation, limited human life
      within a thousand or eight hundred years. The Hindus still
      farther shortened the term. Their books taught that in the
      first age of the world man was free from diseases, and
      lived ordinarily four hundred years; in the second age the
      term of life was reduced from four hundred to three
      hundred; in the third it became two hundred; in the fourth
      and last it was brought down to one hundred&quot;

      <a name="T0002871"><b>Paul -</b> =Saul (q.v.) was born
      about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was
      Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in
      infancy &quot;for use in the Gentile world,&quot; as
      &quot;Saul&quot; would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a
      native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province
      in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the
      banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far;
      hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic
      with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean,
      as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It
      thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its
      inhabitants.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in
      reputation even than the universities of Athens and
      Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul
      was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying
      the best education his native city could afford. His father
      was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the
      tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood (Acts
      23:6; Phil. 3:5). We learn nothing regarding his mother;
      but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman,
      and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a
      mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so
      that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from
      his youth up, &quot;touching the righteousness which is in
      the law, blameless&quot; (Phil. 3:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      We read of his sister and his sister&#39;s son (Acts
      23:16), and of other relatives (Rom. 16:7, 11, 12). Though
      a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this
      privilege we are not informed. &quot;It might be bought, or
      won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in
      several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It
      was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of
      great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his
      father might have been expected to desire him to make use
      of it.&quot; Perhaps the most natural career for the youth
      to follow was that of a merchant. &quot;But it was decided
      that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is,
      a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade
      before entering on the more direct preparation for the
      sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of
      tents from goats&#39; hair cloth, a trade which was one of
      the commonest in Tarsus.
    </p>
    <p>
      His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was
      sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the
      great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a
      student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the
      celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in
      an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many
      questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised
      themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived
      &quot;in all good conscience,&quot; unstained by the vices
      of that great city.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the period of his student-life expired, he probably
      left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged
      in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we
      find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death
      of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding
      the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the
      &quot;Nazarenes.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was
      quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length
      Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public
      and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and
      this led to much excitement among the Jews and much
      disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against
      Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which
      Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time
      probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the
      active leader in the furious persecution by which the
      rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the object of this persecution also failed. &quot;They
      that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the
      word.&quot; The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled
      into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken
      refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest
      letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his
      persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130
      miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which,
      with his few attendants, he steadily went onward,
      &quot;breathing out threatenings and slaughter.&quot; But
      the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last
      stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As
      he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a
      brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid
      prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his
      ears, &quot;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&quot; The
      risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his
      glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the
      stricken persecutor, &quot;Who art thou, Lord?&quot; he
      said, &quot;I am Jesus whom thou persecutest&quot; (Acts
      9:5; 22:8; 26:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in
      all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light (Acts 9:8), his
      companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep
      thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (9:11).
      Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a
      vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was
      sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into
      the Christian church (9:11-16). The whole purpose of his
      life was now permanently changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after his conversion he retired into the
      solitudes of Arabia (Gal. 1:17), perhaps of &quot;Sinai in
      Arabia,&quot; for the purpose, probably, of devout study
      and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been
      made to him. &quot;A veil of thick darkness hangs over this
      visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the
      thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of
      all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped
      the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is
      known. &#39;Immediately,&#39; says St. Paul, &#39;I went
      away into Arabia.&#39; The historian passes over the
      incident [comp. Acts 9:23 and 1 Kings 11:38, 39]. It is a
      mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the
      apostle&#39;s history, a breathless calm, which ushers in
      the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life.&quot;
      Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to
      preach the gospel &quot;boldly in the name of Jesus&quot;
      (Acts 9:27), but was soon obliged to flee (9:25; 2 Cor.
      11:33) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here
      he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee
      (Acts 9:28, 29) from persecution. He now returned to his
      native Tarsus (Gal. 1:21), where, for probably about three
      years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for
      his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel
      to the Gentiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became
      the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel
      gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered.
      Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to
      superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him,
      and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him.
      He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and
      came down to Antioch, which for &quot;a whole year&quot;
      became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with
      great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were
      called &quot;Christians&quot; (Acts 11:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries
      to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as
      their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a
      great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples
      began to give effect to the Master&#39;s command: &quot;Go
      ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
      creature.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary
      tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch,
      across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at
      Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted,
      and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called
      Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and
      then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga
      (Acts 13:13), where John Mark deserted the work and
      returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100
      miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and
      Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian
      Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we
      have any record (13:16-51; comp. 10:30-43), Iconium,
      Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see
      and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders
      in every city to watch over the churches which had been
      gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from
      which they had set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After remaining &quot;a long time&quot;, probably till A.D.
      50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the
      church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the
      Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of
      this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to
      consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which
      was there held (Acts 15) decided against the Judaizing
      party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas,
      returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the
      council.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas:
      &quot;Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city
      where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how
      they do.&quot; Mark proposed again to accompany them; but
      Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to
      take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention.
      They separated, and never again met. Paul, however,
      afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for
      Mark to come to him at Rome (Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began
      his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he
      went by land, revisiting the churches he had already
      founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into &quot;regions
      beyond,&quot; and still went forward through Phrygia and
      Galatia (16:6). Contrary to his intention, he was
      constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some
      bodily affliction (Gal. 4:13, 14). Bithynia, a populous
      province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him,
      and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit
      in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he
      came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas,
      on the north-western coast of Asia Minor (Acts 16:8). Of
      this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account
      except some references to it in his Epistle to the
      Galatians (4:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as
      to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the
      night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing
      before him, and heard him cry, &quot;Come over, and help
      us&quot; (Acts 16:9). Paul recognized in this vision a
      message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail
      across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and
      carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world.
      In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi,
      Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed
      into Achaia, &quot;the paradise of genius and renown.&quot;
      He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief
      sojourn (17:17-31). The Athenians had received him with
      cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He
      passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of
      Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring
      with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two
      epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest
      apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might
      be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He
      was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at
      Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or
      fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to
      Jerusalem, and having &quot;saluted the church&quot; there,
      and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode
      &quot;some time&quot; (Acts 18:20-23).
    </p>
    <p>
      He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by
      land in the &quot;upper coasts&quot; (the more eastern
      parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to
      Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years,
      engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. &quot;This city was
      at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It
      possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the
      traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the
      nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of
      Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such
      cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to
      the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos,
      Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city
      of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of
      pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being
      world-wide&quot; (Stalker&#39;s Life of St. Paul). Here a
      &quot;great door and effectual&quot; was opened to the
      apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work,
      carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other
      places which they could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle
      wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The
      silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they
      made was in danger (see DEMETRIUS &macr;T0001013),
      organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and
      proceeded to Troas (2 Cor. 2:12), whence after some time he
      went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of
      the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second
      epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the
      summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches
      there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica,
      and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the
      shores of the Adriatic (Rom. 15:19), he then came into
      Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the
      greater part of this time in Corinth (Acts 20:2). During
      his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the
      Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the
      end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia,
      thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus,
      there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent
      for to meet him (Acts 20:17), and then sailed for Tyre,
      finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D.
      58.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was
      almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See TEMPLE,
      HEROD&#39;S &macr;T0003611.) Rescued from their violence by
      the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to
      Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a
      prisoner for two years in Herod&#39;s praetorium (Acts
      23:35). &quot;Paul was not kept in close confinement; he
      had at least the range of the barracks in which he was
      detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on
      the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across
      the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and
      Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him,
      or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed
      his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus
      arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to
      inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was
      needing rest. After twenty years of incessant
      evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest
      of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it
      was a time of internal mental activity and silent
      progress&quot; (Stalker&#39;s Life of St. Paul).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in
      the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before
      whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at
      this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he
      appealed to the emperor (Acts 25:11). Such an appeal could
      not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome
      under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the
      &quot;Augustan cohort.&quot; After a long and perilous
      voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early
      spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to
      occupy his own hired house, under constant military
      custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt,
      because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be
      put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept
      guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent
      intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the
      gospel to many of them during these &quot;two whole
      years,&quot; and with the blessed result of spreading among
      the imperial guards, and even in Caesar&#39;s household, an
      interest in the truth (Phil. 1:13). His rooms were resorted
      to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles (Acts
      28:23, 30, 31), and thus his imprisonment &quot;turned
      rather to the furtherance of the gospel,&quot; and his
      &quot;hired house&quot; became the centre of a gracious
      influence which spread over the whole city. According to a
      Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the
      modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome
      from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this
      period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians,
      Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also
      to the Hebrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul
      having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses
      appeared against him. Once more he set out on his
      missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern
      Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he
      wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to
      Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the
      burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the
      Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the
      Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome
      a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the
      Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote.
      &quot;There can be little doubt that he appered again at
      Nero&#39;s bar, and this time the charge did not break
      down. In all history there is not a more startling
      illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of
      Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the
      imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had
      attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest
      being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose
      whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable
      vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at
      the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in
      the prisoner&#39;s dock stood the best man the world
      possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of
      men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was
      condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was
      led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at
      his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the
      block; the headsman&#39;s axe gleamed in the sun and fell;
      and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the
      dust&quot; (probably A.D. 66), four years before the fall
      of Jerusalem.

      in a place called &quot;the Pavement&quot; (John 19:13)
      i.e., a place paved with a mosaic of coloured stones. It
      was probably a place thus prepared in front of the
      &quot;judgment hall.&quot; (See <a href=

      Babylonia (Jer. 50:21; Ezek. 23:23). It is the opinion,
      however, of some that this word signifies
      &quot;visitation,&quot; &quot;punishment,&quot; and
      allegorically &quot;designates Babylon as the city which

      divided&quot; (Gen. 10:25). Possibly he may have lived at
      the time of the dispersion from Babel. But more probably
      the reference is to the dispersion of the two races which
      sprang from Eber, the one spreading towards Mesopotamia and
      Syria, and the other southward into Arabia.</a>

      <a name="T0002889"><b>Pelethites -</b> mentioned always
      along with the Cherethites, and only in the time of David.
      The word probably means &quot;runners&quot; or
      &quot;couriers,&quot; and may denote that while forming
      part of David&#39;s bodyguard, they were also sometimes
      employed as couriers (2 Sam. 8:18; 20:7, 23;1 Kings 1:38,
      44; 1 Chr. 18:17). Some, however, think that these are the
      names simply of two Philistine tribes from which David
      selected his body-guard. They are mentioned along with the
      Gittites (2 Sam. 15:18), another body of foreign troops
      whom David gathered round him.</a>

      <a name="T0002890"><b>Pelicans -</b> are frequently met
      with at the waters of Merom and the Sea of Galilee. The
      pelican is ranked among unclean birds (Lev. 11:18; Deut.
      14:17). It is of an enormous size, being about 6 feet long,
      with wings stretching out over 12 feet. The Hebrew name
      (kaath, i.e., &quot;vomiter&quot;) of this bird is
      incorrectly rendered &quot;cormorant&quot; in the
      Authorized Version of Isa. 34:11 and Zeph. 2:14, but
      correctly in the Revised Version. It receives its Hebrew
      name from its habit of storing in its pouch large
      quantities of fish, which it disgorges when it feeds its
      young. Two species are found on the Syrian coast, the
      Pelicanus onocrotalus, or white pelican, and the Pelicanus
      crispus, or Dalmatian pelican.</a>

      coin of the value of about 7 1/2d. or 8d. of our present
      money. It is thus rendered in the New Testament, and is
      more frequently mentioned than any other coin (Matt. 18:28;
      20:2, 9, 13; Mark 6:37; 14:5, etc.). It was the daily pay
      of a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign of
      Edward III. an English penny was a labourer&#39;s day&#39;s
      wages. This was the &quot;tribute money&quot; with
      reference to which our Lord said, &quot;Whose image and
      superscription is this?&quot; When they answered,
      &quot;Caesar&#39;s,&quot; he replied, &quot;Render
      therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#39;s; and
      to God the things that are God&#39;s&quot; (Matt. 22:19;

      <a name="T0002892"><b>Pentateuch -</b> the five-fold
      volume, consisting of the first five books of the Old
      Testament. This word does not occur in Scripture, nor is it
      certainly known when the roll was thus divided into five
      portions Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
      Probably that was done by the LXX. translators. Some modern
      critics speak of a Hexateuch, introducing the Book of
      Joshua as one of the group. But this book is of an entirely
      different character from the other books, and has a
      different author. It stands by itself as the first of a
      series of historical books beginning with the entrance of
      the Israelites into Canaan. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002100.html&amp;from=T0002114&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">

      The books composing the Pentateuch are properly but one
      book, the &quot;Law of Moses,&quot; the &quot;Book of the
      Law of Moses,&quot; the &quot;Book of Moses,&quot; or, as
      the Jews designate it, the &quot;Torah&quot; or
      &quot;Law.&quot; That in its present form it &quot;proceeds
      from a single author is proved by its plan and aim,
      according to which its whole contents refer to the covenant
      concluded between Jehovah and his people, by the
      instrumentality of Moses, in such a way that everything
      before his time is perceived to be preparatory to this
      fact, and all the rest to be the development of it.
      Nevertheless, this unity has not been stamped upon it as a
      matter of necessity by the latest redactor: it has been
      there from the beginning, and is visible in the first plan
      and in the whole execution of the work.&quot;, Keil, Einl.

    <p>
      A certain school of critics have set themselves to
      reconstruct the books of the Old Testament. By a process of
      &quot;scientific study&quot; they have discovered that the
      so-called historical books of the Old Testament are not
      history at all, but a miscellaneous collection of stories,
      the inventions of many different writers, patched together
      by a variety of editors! As regards the Pentateuch, they
      are not ashamed to attribute fraud, and even conspiracy, to
      its authors, who sought to find acceptance to their work
      which was composed partly in the age of Josiah, and partly
      in that of Ezra and Nehemiah, by giving it out to be the
      work of Moses! This is not the place to enter into the
      details of this controversy. We may say frankly, however,
      that we have no faith in this &quot;higher criticism.&quot;
      It degrades the books of the Old Testament below the level
      of fallible human writings, and the arguments on which its
      speculations are built are altogether untenable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidences in favour of the Mosaic authorship of the
      Pentateuch are conclusive. We may thus state some of them
      briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) These books profess to have been written by Moses in
      the name of God (Ex. 17:14; 24:3, 4, 7; 32:7-10, 30-34;
      34:27; Lev. 26:46; 27:34; Deut. 31:9, 24, 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) This also is the uniform and persistent testimony of
      the Jews of all sects in all ages and countries (comp.
      Josh. 8:31, 32; 1 Kings 2:3; Jer. 7:22; Ezra 6:18; Neh.
      8:1; Mal. 4:4; Matt. 22:24; Acts 15:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Our Lord plainly taught the Mosaic authorship of these
      books (Matt. 5:17, 18; 19:8; 22:31, 32; 23:2; Mark 10:9;
      12:26; Luke 16:31; 20:37; 24:26, 27, 44; John 3:14; 5:45,
      46, 47; 6:32, 49; 7:19, 22). In the face of this fact, will
      any one venture to allege either that Christ was ignorant
      of the composition of the Bible, or that, knowing the true
      state of the case, he yet encouraged the people in the
      delusion they clung to?
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) From the time of Joshua down to the time of Ezra there
      is, in the intermediate historical books, a constant
      reference to the Pentateuch as the &quot;Book of the Law of
      Moses.&quot; This is a point of much importance, inasmuch
      as the critics deny that there is any such reference; and
      hence they deny the historical character of the Pentateuch.
      As regards the Passover, e.g., we find it frequently spoken
      of or alluded to in the historical books following the
      Pentateuch, showing that the &quot;Law of Moses&quot; was
      then certainly known. It was celebrated in the time of
      Joshua (Josh. 5:10, cf. 4:19), Hezekiah (2 Chr. 30), Josiah
      (2 Kings 23; 2 Chr. 35), and Zerubbabel (Ezra 6:19-22), and
      is referred to in such passages as 2 Kings 23:22; 2 Chr.
      35:18; 1 Kings 9:25 (&quot;three times in a year&quot;); 2
      Chr. 8:13. Similarly we might show frequent references to
      the Feast of Tabernacles and other Jewish institutions,
      although we do not admit that any valid argument can be
      drawn from the silence of Scripture in such a case. An
      examination of the following texts, 1 Kings 2:9; 2 Kings
      14:6; 2 Chr. 23:18; 25:4; 34:14; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Dan. 9:11,
      13, will also plainly show that the &quot;Law of
      Moses&quot; was known during all these centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granting that in the time of Moses there existed certain
      oral traditions or written records and documents which he
      was divinely led to make use of in his history, and that
      his writing was revised by inspired successors, this will
      fully account for certain peculiarities of expression which
      critics have called &quot;anachronisms&quot; and
      &quot;contradictions,&quot; but in no way militates against
      the doctrine that Moses was the original author of the
      whole of the Pentateuch. It is not necessary for us to
      affirm that the whole is an original composition; but we
      affirm that the evidences clearly demonstrate that Moses
      was the author of those books which have come down to us
      bearing his name. The Pentateuch is certainly the basis and
      necessary preliminary of the whole of the Old Testament
      history and literature. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0002893"><b>Pentecost -</b> i.e.,
      &quot;fiftieth&quot;, found only in the New Testament (Acts
      2:1; 20:16; 1 Cor. 16:8). The festival so named is first
      spoken of in Ex. 23:16 as &quot;the feast of harvest,&quot;
      and again in Ex. 34:22 as &quot;the day of the
      firstfruits&quot; (Num. 28:26). From the sixteenth of the
      month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover), seven
      complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned,
      and this feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in
      which it was to be kept is described in Lev. 23:15-19; Num.
      28:27-29. Besides the sacrifices prescribed for the
      occasion, every one was to bring to the Lord his
      &quot;tribute of a free-will offering&quot; (Deut.
      16:9-11). The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the
      completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing feature
      was the offering of &quot;two leavened loaves&quot; made
      from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two
      lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of Pentecost is noted in the Christian Church as
      the day on which the Spirit descended upon the apostles,
      and on which, under Peter&#39;s preaching, so many
      thousands were converted in Jerusalem (Acts 2).

      far from Succoth, on the east of the Jordan and north of
      the river Jabbok. It is also called &quot;Peniel.&quot;
      Here Jacob wrestled (Gen. 32:24-32) &quot;with a man&quot;
      (&quot;the angel&quot;, Hos. 12:4. Jacob says of him,
      &quot;I have seen God face to face&quot;) &quot;till the
      break of day.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A town was afterwards built there (Judg. 8:8; 1 Kings
      12:25). The men of this place refused to succour Gideon and
      his little army when they were in pursuit of the Midianites
      (Judg. 8:1-21). On his return, Gideon slew the men of this
      city and razed its lofty watch-tower to the ground.

      peak (Num. 23:28) to which Balak led Balaam as a last
      effort to induce him to pronounce a curse upon Israel. When
      he looked on the tribes encamped in the acacia groves below
      him, he could not refrain from giving utterance to a
      remarkable benediction (24:1-9). Balak was more than ever
      enraged at Balaam, and bade him flee for his life. But
      before he went he gave expression to that wonderful
      prediction regarding the future of this mysterious people,
      whose &quot;goodly tents&quot; were spread out before him,
      and the coming of a &quot;Star&quot; out of Jacob and a
      &quot;Sceptre&quot; out of Israel (24:14-17).</a>
