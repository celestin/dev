    <p>
      <a name="T0002901"><b>Perfumes -</b> were used in religious
      worship, and for personal and domestic enjoyment (Ex.
      30:35-37; Prov. 7:17; Cant. 3:6; Isa. 57:9); and also in
      embalming the dead, and in other funeral ceremonies (Mark
      14:8; Luke 24:1; John 19:39).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002902"><b>Perga -</b> the capital of Pamphylia,
      on the coast of Asia Minor. Paul and his companions landed
      at this place from Cyprus on their first missionary journey
      (Acts 13:13, 14), and here Mark forsook the party and
      returned to Jerusalem. Some time afterwards Paul and
      Barnabas again visited this city and &quot;preached the
      word&quot; (14:25). It stood on the banks of the river
      Cestrus, some 7 miles from its mouth, and was a place of
      some commercial importance. It is now a ruin, called Eski
      Kalessi.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002903"><b>Pergamos -</b> the chief city of
      Mysia, in Asia Minor. One of the &quot;seven churches&quot;
      was planted here (Rev. 1:11; 2:17). It was noted for its
      wickedness, insomuch that our Lord says &quot;Satan&#39;s
      seat&quot; was there. The church of Pergamos was rebuked
      for swerving from the truth and embracing the doctrines of
      Balaam and the Nicolaitanes. Antipas, Christ&#39;s
      &quot;faithful martyr,&quot; here sealed his testimony with
      his blood.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This city stood on the banks of the river Caicus, about 20
      miles from the sea. It is now called Bergama, and has a
      population of some twenty thousand, of whom about two
      thousand profess to be Christians. Parchment (q.v.) was
      first made here, and was called by the Greeks pergamene,
      from the name of the city.

    <p>
      <a name="T0002905"><b>Perizzites -</b> villagers; dwellers
      in the open country, the Canaanitish nation inhabiting the
      fertile regions south and south-west of Carmel. &quot;They
      were the graziers, farmers, and peasants of the time.&quot;
      They were to be driven out of the land by the descendants
      of Abraham (Gen. 15:20; Ex. 3:8, 17; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11).
      They are afterwards named among the conquered tribes (Josh.
      24:11). Still lingering in the land, however, they were
      reduced to servitude by Solomon (1 Kings 9:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002906"><b>Persecution -</b> The first great
      persecution for religious opinion of which we have any
      record was that which broke out against the worshippers of
      God among the Jews in the days of Ahab, when that king, at
      the instigation of his wife Jezebel, &quot;a woman in whom,
      with the reckless and licentious habits of an Oriental
      queen, were united the fiercest and sternest qualities
      inherent in the old Semitic race&quot;, sought in the most
      relentless manner to extirpate the worship of Jehovah and
      substitute in its place the worship of Ashtoreth and Baal.
      Ahab&#39;s example in this respect was followed by
      Manasseh, who &quot;shed innocent blood very much, till he
      had filled Jerusalem from one end to another&quot; (2 Kings
      21:16; comp. 24:4). In all ages, in one form or another,
      the people of God have had to suffer persecution. In its
      earliest history the Christian church passed through many
      bloody persecutions. Of subsequent centuries in our own and
      in other lands the same sad record may be made.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians are forbidden to seek the propagation of the
      gospel by force (Matt. 7:1; Luke 9:54-56; Rom. 14:4; James
      4:11, 12). The words of Ps. 7:13, &quot;He ordaineth his
      arrows against the persecutors,&quot; ought rather to be,
      as in the Revised Version, &quot;He maketh his arrows fiery
      [shafts].&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002907"><b>Perseverance of the saints -</b>
      their certain continuance in a state of grace. Once
      justified and regenerated, the believer can neither totally
      nor finally fall away from grace, but will certainly
      persevere therein and attain everlasting life.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine is clearly taught in these passages, John
      10:28, 29; Rom. 11:29; Phil. 1:6; 1 Pet. 1:5. It, moreover,
      follows from a consideration of (1) the immutability of the
      divine decrees (Jer. 31:3; Matt. 24:22-24; Acts 13:48; Rom.
      8:30); (2) the provisions of the covenant of grace (Jer.
      32:40; John 10:29; 17:2-6); (3) the atonement and
      intercession of Christ (Isa. 53:6, 11; Matt. 20:28; 1 Pet.
      2:24; John 11:42; 17:11, 15, 20; Rom. 8:34); and (4) the
      indwelling of the Holy Ghost (John 14:16; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22;
      5:5; Eph. 1:14; 1 John 3:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine is not inconsistent with the truth that the
      believer may nevertheless fall into grievous sin, and
      continue therein for some time. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0002908"><b>Persia -</b> an ancient empire,
      extending from the Indus to Thrace, and from the Caspian
      Sea to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Persians were
      originally a Medic tribe which settled in Persia, on the
      eastern side of the Persian Gulf. They were Aryans, their
      language belonging to the eastern division of the
      Indo-European group. One of their chiefs, Teispes,
      conquered Elam in the time of the decay of the Assyrian
      Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan.
      His descendants branched off into two lines, one line
      ruling in Anzan, while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus
      II., king of Anzan, finally united the divided power,
      conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and carried his arms
      into the far East. His son, Cambyses, added Egypt to the
      empire, which, however, fell to pieces after his death. It
      was reconquered and thoroughly organized by Darius, the son
      of Hystaspes, whose dominions extended from India to the
      Danube.</a>

      <a name="T0002909"><b>Persis -</b> a female Christian at
      Rome whom Paul salutes (Rom. 16:12). She is spoken of as
      &quot;beloved,&quot; and as having &quot;laboured much in
      the Lord.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002910"><b>Peruda -</b> one whose descendants
      returned with Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:55); called also Perida
      (Neh. 7:57).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002911"><b>Peter -</b> originally called Simon
      (=Simeon ,i.e., &quot;hearing&quot;), a very common Jewish
      name in the New Testament. He was the son of Jona (Matt.
      16:17). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He had a
      younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to
      Jesus (John 1:40-42). His native town was Bethsaida, on the
      western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip
      belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea
      of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher.
      His father had probably died while he was still young, and
      he and his brother were brought up under the care of
      Zebedee and his wife Salome (Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40;
      16:1). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and
      John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant
      fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the
      advantages of a religious training, and were early
      instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with
      the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah.
      They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training
      in the study of the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter
      appeared before the Sanhedrin, he looked like an
      &quot;unlearned man&quot; (Acts 4:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Simon was a Galilean, and he was that out and
      out...The Galileans had a marked character of their own.
      They had a reputation for an independence and energy which
      often ran out into turbulence. They were at the same time
      of a franker and more transparent disposition than their
      brethren in the south. In all these respects, in bluntness,
      impetuosity, headiness, and simplicity, Simon was a genuine
      Galilean. They spoke a peculiar dialect. They had a
      difficulty with the guttural sounds and some others, and
      their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. The
      Galilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. It
      betrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within
      the judgment-hall (Mark 14:70). It betrayed his own
      nationality and that of those conjoined with him on the day
      of Pentecost (Acts 2:7).&quot; It would seem that Simon was
      married before he became an apostle. His wife&#39;s mother
      is referred to (Matt. 8:14; Mark 1:30; Luke 4:38). He was
      in all probability accompanied by his wife on his
      missionary journeys (1 Cor. 9:5; comp. 1 Pet. 5:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ
      entered on his public ministry, and may have reached beyond
      the age of thirty. His house was large enough to give a
      home to his brother Andrew, his wife&#39;s mother, and also
      to Christ, who seems to have lived with him (Mark 1:29, 36;
      2:1), as well as to his own family. It was apparently two
      stories high (2:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bethabara (R.V., John 1:28, &quot;Bethany&quot;), beyond
      Jordan, John the Baptist had borne testimony concerning
      Jesus as the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; (John 1:29-36). Andrew
      and John hearing it, followed Jesus, and abode with him
      where he was. They were convinced, by his gracious words
      and by the authority with which he spoke, that he was the
      Messiah (Luke 4:22; Matt. 7:29); and Andrew went forth and
      found Simon and brought him to Jesus (John 1:41).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter
      he would be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to
      the Greek Petros, which means &quot;a mass of rock detached
      from the living rock.&quot; The Aramaic name does not occur
      again, but the name Peter gradually displaces the old name
      Simon, though our Lord himself always uses the name Simon
      when addressing him (Matt. 17:25; Mark 14:37; Luke 22:31,
      comp. 21:15-17). We are not told what impression the first
      interview with Jesus produced on the mind of Simon. When we
      next meet him it is by the Sea of Galilee (Matt. 4:18-22).
      There the four (Simon and Andrew, James and John) had had
      an unsuccessful night&#39;s fishing. Jesus appeared
      suddenly, and entering into Simon&#39;s boat, bade him
      launch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed
      a great multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle
      wrought before Simon&#39;s eyes. The awe-stricken disciple
      cast himself at the feet of Jesus, crying, &quot;Depart
      from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord&quot; (Luke 5:8).
      Jesus addressed him with the assuring words, &quot;Fear
      not,&quot; and announced to him his life&#39;s work. Simon
      responded at once to the call to become a disciple, and
      after this we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and
      becomes a &quot;fisher of men&quot; (Matt. 4:19) in the
      stormy seas of the world of human life (Matt. 10:2-4; Mark
      3:13-19; Luke 6:13-16), and takes a more and more prominent
      part in all the leading events of our Lord&#39;s life. It
      is he who utters that notable profession of faith at
      Capernaum (John 6:66-69), and again at Caesarea Philippi
      (Matt. 16:13-20; Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-20). This
      profession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and
      our Lord in response used these memorable words: &quot;Thou
      art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;From that time forth&quot; Jesus began to speak of
      his sufferings. For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in
      return rebuked Peter, speaking to him in sterner words than
      he ever used to any other of his disciples (Matt. 16:21-23;
      Mark 8:31-33). At the close of his brief sojourn at
      Caesarea our Lord took Peter and James and John with him
      into &quot;an high mountain apart,&quot; and was
      transfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under the
      impression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed,
      &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make three
      tabernacles&quot; (Matt. 17:1-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax
      (a didrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite
      of twenty years old and upwards had to pay (Ex. 30:15),
      came to Peter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it
      (Matt. 17:24-27). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch
      a fish in the lake and take from its mouth the exact amount
      needed for the tax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels.
      &quot;That take,&quot; said our Lord, &quot;and give unto
      them for me and thee.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John
      (Luke 22:7-13) into the city to prepare a place where he
      should keep the feast with his disciples. There he was
      forewarned of the fearful sin into which he afterwards fell
      (22:31-34). He accompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber
      to the garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:39-46), which he and
      the other two who had been witnesses of the transfiguration
      were permitted to enter with our Lord, while the rest were
      left without. Here he passed through a strange experience.
      Under a sudden impulse he cut off the ear of Malchus
      (47-51), one of the band that had come forth to take Jesus.
      Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall (54-61) and his
      bitter grief (62).
    </p>
    <p>
      He is found in John&#39;s company early on the morning of
      the resurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave
      (John 20:1-10), and saw the &quot;linen clothes laid by
      themselves&quot; (Luke 24:9-12). To him, the first of the
      apostles, our risen Lord revealed himself, thus conferring
      on him a signal honour, and showing how fully he was
      restored to his favour (Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5). We next
      read of our Lord&#39;s singular interview with Peter on the
      shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice asked him,
      &quot;Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?&quot; (John
      21:1-19). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002300.html&amp;from=T0002322&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      LOVE</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till
      he again appears with the others at the ascension (Acts
      1:15-26). It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by
      the apostasy of Judas should be filled up. He is prominent
      on the day of Pentecost (2:14-40). The events of that day
      &quot;completed the change in Peter himself which the
      painful discipline of his fall and all the lengthened
      process of previous training had been slowly making. He is
      now no more the unreliable, changeful, self-confident man,
      ever swaying between rash courage and weak timidity, but
      the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of the
      fellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ in
      Jerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas
      indeed, we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (only in
      Acts 10:5, 32; 15:14), and he is known to us finally as
      Peter.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the miracle at the temple gate (Acts 3) persecution
      arose against the Christians, and Peter was cast into
      prison. He boldly defended himself and his companions at
      the bar of the council (4:19, 20). A fresh outburst of
      violence against the Christians (5:17-21) led to the whole
      body of the apostles being cast into prison; but during the
      night they were wonderfully delivered, and were found in
      the morning teaching in the temple. A second time Peter
      defended them before the council (Acts 5:29-32), who,
      &quot;when they had called the apostles and beaten them,
      let them go.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After
      labouring for some time in Samaria, he returned to
      Jerusalem, and reported to the church there the results of
      his work (Acts 8:14-25). Here he remained for a period,
      during which he met Paul for the first time since his
      conversion (9:26-30; Gal. 1:18). Leaving Jerusalem again,
      he went forth on a missionary journey to Lydda and Joppa
      (Acts 9:32-43). He is next called on to open the door of
      the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission of
      Cornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).

      After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned to
      Jerusalem (Acts 11:1-18), where he defended his conduct
      with reference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being
      cast into prison by Herod Agrippa (12:1-19); but in the
      night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, and he
      went forth and found refuge in the house of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took part in the deliberations of the council in
      Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-31; Gal. 2:1-10) regarding the
      relation of the Gentiles to the church. This subject had
      awakened new interest at Antioch, and for its settlement
      was referred to the council of the apostles and elders at
      Jerusalem. Here Paul and Peter met again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no further mention of Peter in the Acts of the
      Apostles. He seems to have gone down to Antioch after the
      council at Jerusalem, and there to have been guilty of
      dissembling, for which he was severely reprimanded by Paul
      (Gal. 2:11-16), who &quot;rebuked him to his face.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he appears to have carried the gospel to the
      east, and to have laboured for a while at Babylon, on the
      Euphrates (1 Pet. 5:13). There is no satisfactory evidence
      that he was ever at Rome. Where or when he died is not
      certainly known. Probably he died between A.D. 64 and 67.

      Its object is to confirm its readers in the doctrines they

      It was written from Babylon, on the Euphrates, which was at
      this time one of the chief seats of Jewish learning, and a
      fitting centre for labour among the Jews. It has been
      noticed that in the beginning of his epistle Peter names
      the provinces of Asia Minor in the order in which they
      would naturally occur to one writing from Babylon. He
      counsels (1) to steadfastness and perseverance under
      persecution (1-2:10); (2) to the practical duties of a holy
      life (2:11-3:13); (3) he adduces the example of Christ and
      other motives to patience and holiness (3:14-4:19); and (4)
      concludes with counsels to pastors and people (ch. 5).

      <a name="T0002913"><b>Peter, Second Epistle of -</b> The
      question of the authenticity of this epistle has been much
      discussed, but the weight of evidence is wholly in favour
      of its claim to be the production of the apostle whose name
      it bears. It appears to have been written shortly before
      the apostle&#39;s death (1:14). This epistle contains
      eleven references to the Old Testament. It also contains
      (3:15, 16) a remarkable reference to Paul&#39;s epistles.
      Some think this reference is to 1 Thess. 4:13-5:11. A few
      years ago, among other documents, a parchment fragment,
      called the &quot;Gospel of Peter,&quot; was discovered in a
      Christian tomb at Akhmim in Upper Egypt. Origen (obiit A.D.
      254), Eusebius (obiit 340), and Jerome (obiit 420) refer to
      such a work, and hence it has been concluded that it was
      probably written about the middle of the second century. It
      professes to give a history of our Lord&#39;s resurrection
      and ascension. While differing in not a few particulars
      from the canonical Gospels, the writer shows plainly that
      he was acquinted both with the synoptics and with the
      Gospel of John. Though apocryphal, it is of considerable
      value as showing that the main facts of the history of our
      Lord were then widely known.</a>

      the article phe, &quot;the,&quot; prefixed; hence phera,
      &quot;the sun,&quot; or &quot;the sun-god.&quot; But
      others, perhaps more correctly, think the name derived from

    <p>
      (1.) The Pharaoh who was on the throne when Abram went down
      into Egypt (Gen. 12:10-20) was probably one of the Hyksos,
      or &quot;shepherd kings.&quot; The Egyptians called the
      nomad tribes of Syria Shasu, &quot;plunderers,&quot; their
      king or chief Hyk, and hence the name of those invaders who
      conquered the native kings and established a strong
      government, with Zoan or Tanis as their capital. They were
      of Semitic origin, and of kindred blood accordingly with
      Abram. They were probably driven forward by the pressure of
      the Hittites. The name they bear on the monuments is
      &quot;Mentiu.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The Pharaoh of Joseph&#39;s days (Gen. 41) was
      probably Apopi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. To
      the old native Egyptians, who were an African race,
      shepherds were &quot;an abomination;&quot; but to the
      Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with
      Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their
      own race, had a warm welcome (Gen. 47:5, 6). Some argue
      that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III.,
      long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his
      influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the
      religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which
      characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The
      wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is
      this singular fact to be explained from the presence of
      some of Joseph&#39;s kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh
      said to Joseph, &quot;Thy father and thy brethren are come
      unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of
      the land make thy father and brethren to dwell&quot; (Gen.
      47:5, 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The &quot;new king who knew not Joseph&quot; (Ex.
      1:8-22) has been generally supposed to have been Aahmes I.,
      or Amosis, as he is called by Josephus. Recent discoveries,
      however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the
      &quot;new king.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the
      powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their
      condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed.
      The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had
      been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty
      restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon.
      They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process
      of time a change appears to have taken place in the
      government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it
      is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its
      founder. He associated with him in his government his son,
      Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak,
      near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact
      that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the
      beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets
      by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of
      the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes
      and different places along the Nile. This led him to
      suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the
      Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics,
      now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there.
      For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find
      the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those
      in the secret volunteered to give information regarding
      this burial-place. The result was that a party was
      conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the
      wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of
      kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a
      cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed
      for thirty centuries. &quot;The temple of Deir el-Bahari
      stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs,
      which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into
      which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up.
      In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next
      to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the
      hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three
      thousand years.&quot; The exploring party being guided to
      the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square
      and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the
      bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then
      turned sharply northward into the very heart of the
      mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in
      height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of
      antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and
      brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the
      royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus
      discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II.
      Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the
      brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound
      &quot;once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries,
      human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had
      conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised
      Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle,
      however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in
      so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty
      photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and
      vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human
      view for ever.&quot; &quot;It seems strange that though the
      body of this man,&quot; who overran Palestine with his
      armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses,
      &quot;mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been
      wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their
      colour could be distinguished&quot; (Manning&#39;s Land of
      the Pharaohs).
    </p>
    <p>
      Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses
      II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great
      builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought
      to view &quot;the most beautiful mummy head ever seen
      within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and
      Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that
      delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the
      admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two
      centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which
      characterized the features of the living man. Most
      remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses
      II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the
      son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses
      II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is
      shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body
      points to considerably more than threescore years of life,
      thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have
      attributed a long reign to this king.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Rameses II., the son of Seti I., is probably the
      Pharaoh of the Oppression. During his forty years&#39;
      residence at the court of Egypt, Moses must have known this
      ruler well. During his sojourn in Midian, however, Rameses
      died, after a reign of sixty-seven years, and his body
      embalmed and laid in the royal sepulchre in the Valley of
      the Tombs of Kings beside that of his father. Like the
      other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deir el-Bahari,
      it had been for some reason removed from its original tomb,
      and probably carried from place to place till finally
      deposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1886, the mummy of this king, the &quot;great
      Rameses,&quot; the &quot;Sesostris&quot; of the Greeks, was
      unwound, and showed the body of what must have been a
      robust old man. The features revealed to view are thus
      described by Maspero: &quot;The head is long and small in
      proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare.
      On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll
      the hair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks
      about two inches in length. White at the time of death,
      they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in
      embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge
      prominent; the eye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are
      small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched
      like the noses of the Bourbons; the temples are sunk; the
      cheek-bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far
      out from the head, and pierced, like those of a woman, for
      the wearing of earrings; the jaw-bone is massive and
      strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but
      thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white
      and well preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They
      seem to have been kept shaven during life, but were
      probably allowed to grow during the king&#39;s last
      illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are
      white, like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh
      and bristly, and a tenth of an inch in length. The skin is
      of an earthy-brown, streaked with black. Finally, it may be
      said, the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face
      of the living king. The expression is unintellectual,
      perhaps slightly animal; but even under the somewhat
      grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly to be
      seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of
      pride.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both on his father&#39;s and his mother&#39;s side it has
      been pretty clearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or
      Mesopotamian blood in his veins to such a degree that he
      might be called an Assyrian. This fact is thought to throw
      light on Isa. 52:4.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I.,
      the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He
      resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with
      Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy
      was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a
      question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah
      was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of
      evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is
      known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous
      end. The &quot;Harris papyrus,&quot; found at Medinet-Abou
      in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses
      III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at
      length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by
      wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great
      reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the
      Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This
      period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the
      founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie
      discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at
      Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn
      of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who
      had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of
      Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that &#39;the
      Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they
      have no seed.&#39; Menephtah was son and successor of
      Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars
      have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus
      is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the
      event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the
      inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative
      of &#39;country&#39; or &#39;district&#39; attached to it,
      as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon,
      Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along
      with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the
      hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to
      the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events
      they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of
      their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them
      the Pharaoh&#39;s version of the Exodus, the disasters
      which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in
      silence, and only the destruction of the &#39;men
      children&#39; of the Israelites being recorded. The
      statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to
      Ex. 1:10-22.&quot;

      princesses are thus mentioned in Scripture: (1.) The
      princess who adopted the infant Moses (q.v.), Ex. 2:10. She
      is twice mentioned in the New Testament (Acts 7:21: Heb.
      11:24). It would seem that she was alive and in some
      position of influence about the court when Moses was
      compelled to flee from Egypt, and thus for forty years he
      had in some way been under her influence. She was in all
      probability the sister of Rameses, and the daughter of Seti
      I. Josephus calls her Thermuthis. It is supposed by some
      that she was Nefert-ari, the wife as well as sister of
      Rameses. The mummy of this queen was among the treasures
      found at Deir-el-Bahari.</a>

      &quot;pious&quot;), a party that originated in the time of
      Antiochus Epiphanes in revolt against his heathenizing
      policy. The first mention of them is in a description by
      Josephus of the three sects or schools into which the Jews
      were divided (B.C. 145). The other two sects were the
      Essenes and the Sadducees. In the time of our Lord they
      were the popular party (John 7:48). They were extremely
      accurate and minute in all matters appertaining to the law
      of Moses (Matt. 9:14; 23:15; Luke 11:39; 18:12). Paul, when
      brought before the council of Jerusalem, professed himself
      a Pharisee (Acts 23:6-8; 26:4, 5).</a>

      There was much that was sound in their creed, yet their
      system of religion was a form and nothing more. Theirs was
      a very lax morality (Matt. 5:20; 15:4, 8; 23:3, 14, 23, 25;
      John 8:7). On the first notice of them in the New Testament
      (Matt. 3:7), they are ranked by our Lord with the Sadducees
      as a &quot;generation of vipers.&quot; They were noted for
      their self-righteousness and their pride (Matt. 9:11; Luke
      7:39; 18:11, 12). They were frequently rebuked by our Lord
      (Matt. 12:39; 16:1-4).

      From the very beginning of his ministry the Pharisees

      Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was
      the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It
      was the &quot;England of antiquity.&quot; &quot;The trade
      routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the
      centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding
      their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to
      the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the
      vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through
      the Canaanite capital to the eastern world.&quot; It was
      &quot;situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the
      people for many isles&quot; (Ezek. 27:3, 4). The
      far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians,
      especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched
      them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury
      and developed among them a great activity in all manner of
      arts and manufactures. (See <a href=

      The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the
      old world, establishing colonies at various places, of
      which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch
      of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians,
      from their principal city of Sidon. None could &quot;skill
      to hew timber like unto the Sidonians&quot; (1 Kings 5:6).
      King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in
      connection with the planning and building of the temple,
      casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and
      the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and
      &quot;the molten sea&quot; (1 Kings 7:21-23). Singular
      marks have been found by recent exploration on the great
      stones that form the substructure of the temple. These
      marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as
      made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably
      intended to indicate the place of these stones in the
      building. &quot;The Biblical account (1 Kings 5:17, 18) is
      accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing
      at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and
      standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present
      surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the
      rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed
      stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while
      Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks
      painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the
      stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen
      of Hiram, the king of Tyre.&quot; (See <a href=

      The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors
      of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their
      thoughts by certain symbols, called
      &quot;hieroglyphics&quot;, i.e., sacred carvings, so styled
      because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The
      recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern
      Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in
      connection with various philogical considerations, has led
      some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was
      derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the
      kingdom of Ma&#39;in, Judg. 10:12; 2 Chr. 26:7). Thus the
      Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce
      thinks &quot;it is more than possible that the Egyptians
      themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia.&quot; (See

      One of the twelve apostles; a native of Bethsaida,
      &quot;the city of Andrew and Peter&quot; (John 1:44). He
      readily responded to the call of Jesus when first addressed
      to him (43), and forthwith brought Nathanael also to Jesus
      (45,46). He seems to have held a prominent place among the
      apostles (Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; John 6:5-7; 12:21, 22;
      14:8, 9; Acts 1:13). Of his later life nothing is certainly
      known. He is said to have preached in Phrygia, and to have
      met his death at Hierapolis.</a>

    <p>
      (2.) One of the &quot;seven&quot; (Acts 6:5), called also
      &quot;the evangelist&quot; (21:8, 9). He was one of those
      who were &quot;scattered abroad&quot; by the persecution
      that arose on the death of Stephen. He went first to
      Samaria, where he laboured as an evangelist with much
      success (8:5-13). While he was there he received a divine
      command to proceed toward the south, along the road leading
      from Jerusalem to Gaza. These towns were connected by two
      roads. The one Philip was directed to take was that which
      led through Hebron, and thence through a district little
      inhabited, and hence called &quot;desert.&quot; As he
      travelled along this road he was overtaken by a chariot in
      which sat a man of Ethiopia, the eunuch or chief officer of
      Queen Candace, who was at that moment reading, probably
      from the Septuagint version, a portion of the prophecies of
      Isaiah (53:6,7). Philip entered into conversation with him,
      and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad
      tidings of the Saviour. The eunuch received the message and
      believed, and was forthwith baptized, and then &quot;went
      on his way rejoicing.&quot; Philip was instantly caught
      away by the Spirit after the baptism, and the eunuch saw
      him no more. He was next found at Azotus, whence he went
      forth in his evangelistic work till he came to Caesarea. He
      is not mentioned again for about twenty years, when he is
      still found at Caesarea (Acts 21:8) when Paul and his
      companions were on the way to Jerusalem. He then finally
      disappears from the page of history.

      about 8 miles north-west of Kavalla. It is now a ruined
      village, called Philibedjik. Philip of Macedonia fortified
      the old Thracian town of Crenides, and called it after his
      own name Philippi (B.C. 359-336). In the time of the
      Emperor Augustus this city became a Roman colony, i.e., a
      military settlement of Roman soldiers, there planted for
      the purpose of controlling the district recently conquered.
      It was a &quot;miniature Rome,&quot; under the municipal
      law of Rome, and governed by military officers, called
      duumviri, who were appointed directly from Rome. Having
      been providentially guided thither, here Paul and his
      companion Silas preached the gospel and formed the first
      church in Europe. (See <a href=

      honour of the emperor. But in order to distinguish it from
      the Caesarea on the sea coast, he added to it subsequently
      his own name, and called it Caesarea-Philippi (q.v.).

      <a name="T0002938"><b>Philippians, Epistle to -</b> was
      written by Paul during the two years when he was &quot;in

      year A.D. 62 or in the end of 61.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their messenger,
      with contributions to meet the necessities of the apostle;
      and on his return Paul sent back with him this letter. With
      this precious communication Epaphroditus sets out on his
      homeward journey. &quot;The joy caused by his return, and
      the effect of this wonderful letter when first read in the
      church of Philippi, are hidden from us. And we may almost
      say that with this letter the church itself passes from our
      view. To-day, in silent meadows, quiet cattle browse among
      the ruins which mark the site of what was once the
      flourishing Roman colony of Philippi, the home of the most
      attractive church of the apostolic age. But the name and
      fame and spiritual influence of that church will never
      pass. To myriads of men and women in every age and nation
      the letter written in a dungeon at Rome, and carried along
      the Egnatian Way by an obscure Christian messenger, has
      been a light divine and a cheerful guide along the most
      rugged paths of life&quot; (Professor Beet).
    </p>
    <p>
      The church at Philippi was the first-fruits of European
      Christianity. Their attachment to the apostle was very
      fervent, and so also was his affection for them. They alone
      of all the churches helped him by their contributions,
      which he gratefully acknowledges (Acts 20:33-35; 2 Cor.
      11:7-12; 2 Thess. 3:8). The pecuniary liberality of the
      Philippians comes out very conspicuously (Phil. 4:15).
      &quot;This was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions,
      as 2 Cor. 8 and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is
      remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class,
      very poor (2 Cor. 8:2); and the parallel facts, their
      poverty and their open-handed support of the great
      missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious. At the
      present day the missionary liberality of poor Christians
      is, in proportion, really greater than that of the
      rich&quot; (Moule&#39;s Philippians, Introd.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of this epistle give an interesting insight
      into the condition of the church at Rome at the time it was
      written. Paul&#39;s imprisonment, we are informed, was no
      hindrance to his preaching the gospel, but rather
      &quot;turned out to the furtherance of the gospel.&quot;
      The gospel spread very extensively among the Roman
      soldiers, with whom he was in constant contact, and the
      Christians grew into a &quot;vast multitude.&quot; It is
      plain that Christianity was at this time making rapid
      advancement in Rome.

      The doctrinal statements of this epistle bear a close
      relation to those of the Epistle to the Romans. Compare
      also Phil. 3:20 with Eph. 2:12, 19, where the church is
      presented under the idea of a city or commonwealth for the
      first time in Paul&#39;s writings. The personal glory of
      Christ is also set forth in almost parallel forms of
      expression in Phil. 2:5-11, compared with Eph. 1:17-23;
      2:8; and Col. 1:15-20. &quot;This exposition of the grace
      and wonder of His personal majesty, personal
      self-abasement, and personal exaltation after it,&quot;
      found in these epistles, &quot;is, in a great measure, a
      new development in the revelations given through St.
      Paul&quot; (Moule). Other minuter analogies in forms of
      expression and of thought are also found in these epistles
      of the Captivity.

      <a name="T0002939"><b>Philistia -</b> =Palestine (q.v.),
      &quot;the land of the Philistines&quot; (Ps. 60:8; 87:4;
      108:9). The word is supposed to mean &quot;the land of
      wanderers&quot; or &quot;of strangers.&quot;</a>

      <a name="T0002940"><b>Philistines -</b> (Gen. 10:14, R.V.;
      but in A.V., &quot;Philistim&quot;), a tribe allied to the
      Phoenicians. They were a branch of the primitive race which
      spread over the whole district of the Lebanon and the
      valley of the Jordan, and Crete and other Mediterranean
      islands. Some suppose them to have been a branch of the
      Rephaim (2 Sam. 21:16-22). In the time of Abraham they
      inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being
      their king (Gen. 21:32, 34; 26:1). They are, however, not
      noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the
      Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos (9:7) and Jeremiah
      (47:4) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some
      think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus
      to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of
      country which lay between Judea and Egypt (Ex. 13:17;
      15:14, 15; Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against the
      Hebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. They
      sometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes,
      in degrading servitude (Judg. 15:11; 1 Sam. 13:19-22); at
      other times they were defeated with great slaughter (1 Sam.
      14:1-47; 17). These hostilities did not cease till the time
      of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:8), when they were entirely
      subdued. They still, however, occupied their territory, and
      always showed their old hatred to Israel (Ezek. 25:15-17).
      They were finally conquered by the Romans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the
      Egyptian monuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia)
      being termed Palastu and Pilista in the Assyrian
      inscriptions. They occupied the five cities of Gaza,
      Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, in the south-western
      corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt up to the closing
      days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupation took place
      during the reign of Rameses III. of the Twentieth Dynasty.
      The Philistines had formed part of the great naval
      confederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually
      repulsed by that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge
      them from their settlements in Palestine. As they did not
      enter Palestine till the time of the Exodus, the use of the
      name Philistines in Gen. 26:1 must be proleptic. Indeed the
      country was properly Gerar, as in ch. 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are called Allophyli, &quot;foreigners,&quot; in the
      Septuagint, and in the Books of Samuel they are spoken of
      as uncircumcised. It would therefore appear that they were
      not of the Semitic race, though after their establishment
      in Canaan they adopted the Semitic language of the country.
      We learn from the Old Testament that they came from
      Caphtor, usually supposed to be Crete. From Philistia the
      name of the land of the Philistines came to be extended to
      the whole of &quot;Palestine.&quot; Many scholars identify
      the Philistines with the Pelethites of 2 Sam. 8:18.

      from old Egypt, the negro. (1.) Son of Eleazar, the high
      priest (Ex. 6:25). While yet a youth he distinguished
      himself at Shittim by his zeal against the immorality into
      which the Moabites had tempted the people (Num. 25:1-9),
      and thus &quot;stayed the plague&quot; that had broken out
      among the people, and by which twenty-four thousand of them
      perished. For his faithfulness on that occasion he received
      the divine approbation (10-13). He afterwards commanded the
      army that went out against the Midianites (31:6-8). When
      representatives of the people were sent to expostulate with
      the two and a half tribes who, just after crossing Jordan,
      built an altar and departed without giving any explanation,
      Phinehas was their leader, and addressed them in the words
      recorded in Josh. 22:16-20. Their explanation follows. This
      great altar was intended to be all ages only a witness that
      they still formed a part of Israel. Phinehas was afterwards
      the chief adviser in the war with the Benjamites. He is
      commemorated in Ps. 106:30, 31. (See <a href=

      (31). He died in battle with the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:4,

      <a name="T0002954"><b>Pilate, Pontius -</b> probably
      connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called
      &quot;Pilate&quot; from the Latin pileatus, i.e.,
      &quot;wearing the pileus&quot;, which was the &quot;cap or
      badge of a manumitted slave,&quot; as indicating that he
      was a &quot;freedman,&quot; or the descendant of one. He
      was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of
      Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but
      he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over
      the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus
      Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into
      prominent notice. Pilate was a &quot;typical Roman, not of
      the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a
      man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice
      in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt.
      He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation
      freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with
      cordiality, and accused him of every crime,
      maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited
      Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one
      accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres,
      baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its
      religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary
      residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of
      Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by
      Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the
      displaced sovereigns.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to
      the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem
      as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now
      residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be
      in Herod&#39;s palace. Pilate came forth from his palace
      and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer
      to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had
      to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a
      &quot;malefactor.&quot; Pilate was not satisfied with this,
      and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2)
      preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of
      assuming the title of king (Luke 23:2). Pilate now withdrew
      with Jesus into the palace (John 18:33) and examined him in
      private (37,38); and then going out to the deputation still
      standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no
      fault in Jesus (Luke 23:4). This only aroused them to more
      furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the
      populace &quot;throughout all Jewry, beginning from
      Galilee.&quot; When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the
      accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that
      province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he
      found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at
      nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple
      robe of mockery (23:11, 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault
      in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that
      they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the
      judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision (Matt.
      27:19). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent
      a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with
      the &quot;just person.&quot; Pilate&#39;s feelings of
      perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while
      the crowd vehemently cried out, &quot;Not this man, but
      Barabbas.&quot; Pilate answered, &quot;What then shall I do
      with Jesus?&quot; The fierce cry immediately followed.
      &quot;Let him be crucified.&quot; Pilate, apparently vexed,
      and not knowning what to do, said, &quot;Why, what evil
      hath he done?&quot; but with yet fiercer fanaticism the
      crowd yelled out, &quot;Away with him! crucify him, crucify
      him!&quot; Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be
      scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors;
      but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and
      hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This
      done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they
      threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off
      robe of state (Matt. 27:28; John 19:2), and putting a reed
      in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed
      the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying,
      &quot;Hail, King of the Jews!&quot; They took also the reed
      and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his
      face, heaping upon him every indignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium
      (Matt. 27:27) before the people, wearing the crown of
      thorns and the purple robe, saying, &quot;Behold the
      man!&quot; But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned
      and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again
      they cried out, &quot;Crucify him, crucify him!&quot; and
      brought forth this additional charge against him, that he
      professed to be &quot;the Son of God.&quot; Pilate heard
      this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him
      once more within the Praetorium, asked him, &quot;Whence
      art thou?&quot; Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was
      irritated by his continued silence, and said, &quot;Knowest
      thou not that I have power to crucify thee?&quot; Jesus,
      with calm dignity, answered the Roman, &quot;Thou couldest
      have no power at all against me, except it were given thee
      from above.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let
      Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, &quot;If
      thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar&#39;s
      friend.&quot; This settled the matter. He was afraid of
      being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed
      his hands in the sight of the people, saying, &quot;I am
      innocent of the blood of this just person.&quot; The mob,
      again scorning his scruples, cried, &quot;His blood be on
      us, and on our children.&quot; Pilate was stung to the
      heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before
      them, said, &quot;Shall I crucify your King?&quot; The
      fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, &quot;We
      have no king but Caesar;&quot; and now Jesus is given up to
      them, and led away to be crucified.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed,
      according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the
      crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from
      the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to
      Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate&#39;s name now
      disappears from the Gospel history. References to him,
      however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (3:13; 4:27;
      13:28), and in 1 Tim. 6:13. In A.D. 36 the governor of
      Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he
      was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to
      tradition, he committed suicide.

      some 300 feet above the Kidron valley. The pinnacle, some

      of the Greek historian Herodotus. It has now been
      satisfactorily identified with Tell-el-Maskhuta, about 12
      miles west of Ismailia, and 20 east of Tel-el-Kebir, on the
      southern bank of the present Suez Canal. Here have recently
      (1883) been discovered the ruins of supposed
      grain-chambers, and other evidences to show that this was a
      great &quot;store city.&quot; Its immense ruin-heaps show
      that it was built of bricks, and partly also of bricks
      without straw. Succoth (Ex. 12:37) is supposed by some to
      be the secular name of this city, Pithom being its sacred
      name. This was the first halting-place of the Israelites in
      their exodus. It has been argued (Dr. Lansing) that these
      &quot;store&quot; cities &quot;were residence cities, royal
      dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of
      Israel, and our modern Khedives have ever loved to build,

      or diseases, (Lev. 13:3, 5, 30; 1 Kings 8:37), or severe
      calamity (Mark 5:29; Luke 7:21), or the judgment of God, so
      called (Ex. 9:14). Plagues of Egypt were ten in number.</a>

    <p>
      (1.) The river Nile was turned into blood, and the fish
      died, and the river stank, so that the Egyptians loathed to
      drink of the river (Ex. 7:14-25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The plague of frogs (Ex. 8:1-15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The plague of lice (Heb. kinnim, properly gnats or
      mosquitoes; comp. Ps. 78:45; 105:31), &quot;out of the dust
      of the land&quot; (Ex. 8:16-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The plague of flies (Heb. arob, rendered by the LXX.
      dog-fly), Ex. 8:21-24.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The murrain (Ex.9:1-7), or epidemic pestilence which
      carried off vast numbers of cattle in the field. Warning
      was given of its coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) The sixth plague, of &quot;boils and blains,&quot;
      like the third, was sent without warning (Ex.9:8-12). It is
      called (Deut. 28:27) &quot;the botch of Egypt,&quot; A.V.;
      but in R.V., &quot;the boil of Egypt.&quot; &quot;The
      magicians could not stand before Moses&quot; because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) The plague of hail, with fire and thunder (Ex.
      9:13-33). Warning was given of its coming. (Comp. Ps.
      18:13; 105:32, 33).
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) The plague of locusts, which covered the whole face of
      the earth, so that the land was darkened with them (Ex.
      10:12-15). The Hebrew name of this insect, <i>arbeh</i>,
      points to the &quot;multitudinous&quot; character of this
      visitation. Warning was given before this plague came.
    </p>
    <p>
      (9.) After a short interval the plague of darkness
      succeeded that of the locusts; and it came without any
      special warning (Ex. 10:21-29). The darkness covered
      &quot;all the land of Egypt&quot; to such an extent that
      &quot;they saw not one another.&quot; It did not, however,
      extend to the land of Goshen.
    </p>
    <p>
      (10.) The last and most fearful of these plagues was the
      death of the first-born of man and of beast (Ex. 11:4, 5;
      12:29,30). The exact time of the visitation was announced,
      &quot;about midnight&quot;, which would add to the horror
      of the infliction. Its extent also is specified, from the
      first-born of the king to the first-born of the humblest
      slave, and all the first-born of beasts. But from this
      plague the Hebrews were completely exempted. The Lord
      &quot;put a difference&quot; between them and the
      Egyptians. (See <a href=

      vineyards,&quot; as in the Authorized Version, the Revised
      Version has &quot;Abel-cheramim&quot; (q.v.), comp. Judg.
      11:22; 2 Chr. 16:4.</a>

      (3.) Heb. bik&#39;ah (Gen. 11:2; Neh. 6:2; Ezek. 3:23; Dan.
      3:1), properly a valley, as rendered in Isa. 40:4, a broad
      plain between mountains. In Amos 1:5 the margin of
      Authorized Version has &quot;Bikathaven.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. kikar, &quot;the circle,&quot; used only of the
      Ghor, or the low ground along the Jordan (Gen. 13:10-12;
      19:17, 25, 28, 29; Deut. 34:3; 2 Sam. 18:23; 1 Kings 7:46;
      2 Chr. 4:17; Neh. 3:22; 12:28), the floor of the valley

      Jer. 48:21), an expanse of rolling downs without rock or
      stone. In these passages, with the article prefixed, it
      denotes the plain in the tribe of Reuben. In 2 Chr. 26:10
      the plain of Judah is meant. Jerusalem is called &quot;the
      rock of the plain&quot; in Jer. 21:13, because the hills on
      which it is built rise high above the plain.

      southward to the Dead Sea (the &quot;sea of the
      plain,&quot; 2 Kings 14:25; Deut. 1:1; 2:8), a distance of
      about 70 miles. It is called by the modern Arabs the Ghor.
      This Hebrew name is found in Authorized Version (Josh.
      18:18), and is uniformly used in the Revised Version. Down
      through the centre of this plain is a ravine, from 200 to
      300 yards wide, and from 50 to 100 feet deep, through which
      the Jordan flows in a winding course. This ravine is called
      the &quot;lower plain.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Arabah is also applied to the whole Jordan valley
      from Mount Hermon to the eastern branch of the Red Sea, a
      distance of about 200 miles, as well as to that portion of
      the valley which stretches from the Sea of Galilee to the
      same branch of the Red Sea, i.e., to the Gulf of Akabah
      about 100 miles in all.

      Version (1 Chr. 27:28; 2 Chr. 26:10) it is also rendered
      &quot;low country.&quot; In Jer. 17:26, Obad. 1:19, Zech.

      <a name="T0002976"><b>Poetry -</b> has been well defined as
      &quot;the measured language of emotion.&quot; Hebrew poetry
      deals almost exclusively with the great question of
      man&#39;s relation to God. &quot;Guilt, condemnation,
      punishment, pardon, redemption, repentance are the awful
      themes of this heaven-born poetry.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Hebrew scriptures there are found three distinct
      kinds of poetry, (1) that of the Book of Job and the Song
      of Solomon, which is dramatic; (2) that of the Book of
      Psalms, which is lyrical; and (3) that of the Book of
      Ecclesiastes, which is didactic and sententious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hebrew poetry has nothing akin to that of Western nations.
      It has neither metre nor rhyme. Its great peculiarity
      consists in the mutual correspondence of sentences or
      clauses, called parallelism, or &quot;thought-rhyme.&quot;
      Various kinds of this parallelism have been pointed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Synonymous or cognate parallelism, where the same idea
      is repeated in the same words (Ps. 93:3; 94:1; Prov. 6:2),
      or in different words (Ps. 22, 23, 28, 114, etc.); or where
      it is expressed in a positive form in the one clause and in
      a negative in the other (Ps. 40:12; Prov. 6:26); or where
      the same idea is expressed in three successive clauses (Ps.
      40:15, 16); or in a double parallelism, the first and
      second clauses corresponding to the third and fourth (Isa.
      9:1; 61:10, 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Antithetic parallelism, where the idea of the second
      clause is the converse of that of the first (Ps. 20:8;
      27:6, 7; 34:11; 37:9, 17, 21, 22). This is the common form
      of gnomic or proverbial poetry. (See Prov. 10-15.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Synthetic or constructive or compound parallelism,
      where each clause or sentence contains some accessory idea
      enforcing the main idea (Ps. 19:7-10; 85:12; Job 3:3-9;
      Isa. 1:5-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Introverted parallelism, in which of four clauses the
      first answers to the fourth and the second to the third
      (Ps. 135:15-18; Prov. 23:15, 16), or where the second line
      reverses the order of words in the first (Ps. 86:2).

    <p>
      Hebrew poetry sometimes assumes other forms than these.
      (1.) An alphabetical arrangement is sometimes adopted for
      the purpose of connecting clauses or sentences. Thus in the
      following the initial words of the respective verses begin
      with the letters of the alphabet in regular succession:
      Prov. 31:10-31; Lam. 1, 2, 3, 4; Ps. 25, 34, 37, 145. Ps.
      119 has a letter of the alphabet in regular order beginning
      every eighth verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The repetition of the same verse or of some emphatic
      expression at intervals (Ps. 42, 107, where the refrain is
      in verses, 8, 15, 21, 31). (Comp. also Isa. 9:8-10:4; Amos
      1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Gradation, in which the thought of one verse is
      resumed in another (Ps. 121).

      Several odes of great poetical beauty are found in the
      historical books of the Old Testament, such as the song of
      Moses (Ex. 15), the song of Deborah (Judg. 5), of Hannah (1
      Sam. 2), of Hezekiah (Isa. 38:9-20), of Habakkuk (Hab. 3),
      and David&#39;s &quot;song of the bow&quot; (2 Sam.
      1:19-27).

      taste (Ps. 69:21; Lam. 3:5), and coupled with wormwood;
      probably the poppy. This word is rendered &quot;gall&quot;,
      q.v., (Deut. 29:18; 32:33; Ps. 69:21; Jer. 8:14, etc.),

      (Num. 20:5) and Palestine (13:23; Deut. 8:8). The Romans
      called it Punicum malum, i.e., Carthaginian apple, because
      they received it from Carthage. It belongs to the myrtle
      family of trees. The withering of the pomegranate tree is
      mentioned among the judgments of God (Joel 1:12). It is
      frequently mentioned in the Song of Solomon (Cant. 4:3, 13,
      etc.). The skirt of the high priest&#39;s blue robe and
      ephod was adorned with the representation of pomegranates,
      alternating with golden bells (Ex. 28:33,34), as also were
      the &quot;chapiters upon the two pillars&quot; (1 Kings

      Sea, corresponding nearly to the modern province of
      Trebizond. In the time of the apostles it was a Roman
      province. Strangers from this province were at Jerusalem at
      Pentecost (Acts 2:9), and to &quot;strangers scattered
      throughout Pontus,&quot; among others, Peter addresses his

      artificial cistern or tank. Mention is made of the pool of
      Gibeon (2 Sam. 2:13); the pool of Hebron (4:12); the upper
      pool at Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:17; 20:20); the pool of

      mentioned. Isaiah (35:7) says, &quot;The parched ground
      shall become a pool.&quot; This is rendered in the Revised
      Version &quot;glowing sand,&quot; etc. (marg., &quot;the
      mirage,&quot; etc.). The Arabs call the mirage
      &quot;serab,&quot; plainly the same as the Hebrew word <i>
      sarab</i>, here rendered &quot;parched ground.&quot;
      &quot;The mirage shall become a pool&quot;, i.e., the
      mock-lake of the burning desert shall become a real lake,
      &quot;the pledge of refreshment and joy.&quot; The
      &quot;pools&quot; spoken of in Isa. 14:23 are the marshes

      The cisterns or pools of the Holy City are for the most
      part excavations beneath the surface. Such are the vast
      cisterns in the temple hill that have recently been
      discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration
      Fund. These underground caverns are about thirty-five in
      number, and are capable of storing about ten million
      gallons of water. They are connected with one another by
      passages and tunnels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0002983"><b>Pools of Solomon -</b> the name given
      to three large open cisterns at Etam, at the head of the
      Wady Urtas, having an average length of 400 feet by 220 in
      breadth, and 20 to 30 in depth. These pools derive their
      chief supply of water from a spring called &quot;the sealed
      fountain,&quot; about 200 yards to the north-west of the
      upper pool, to which it is conveyed by a large subterranean
      passage. They are 150 feet distant from each other, and
      each pool is 20 feet lower than that above it, the conduits
      being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest and
      finest of the three, is filled first, and then in
      succession the others. It has been estimated that these
      pools cover in all a space of about 7 acres, and are
      capable of containing three million gallons of water. They
      were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of
      Solomon. They are probably referred to in Eccles. 2:6. On
      the fourth day after his victory over the Ammonites, etc.,
      in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled his army
      in the valley of Berachah (&quot;blessing&quot;), and there
      blessed the Lord. Berachah has been identified with the
      modern Bereikut, some 5 miles south of Wady Urtas, and
      hence the &quot;valley of Berachah&quot; may be this valley
      of pools, for the word means both &quot;blessing&quot; and
      &quot;pools;&quot; and it has been supposed, therefore,
      that this victory was celebrated beside Solomon&#39;s pools
      (2 Chr. 20:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      These pools were primarily designed to supply Jerusalem
      with water. From the lower pool an aqueduct has been traced
      conveying the water through Bethlehem and across the valley
      of Gihon, and along the west slope of the Tyropoeon valley,
      till it finds its way into the great cisterns underneath
      the temple hill. The water, however, from the pools reaches
      now only to Bethlehem. The aqueduct beyond this has been
      destroyed.

      <a name="T0002984"><b>Poor -</b> The Mosaic legislation
      regarding the poor is specially important. (1.) They had
      the right of gleaning the fields (Lev. 19:9, 10; Deut.
      24:19,21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) In the sabbatical year they were to have their share
      of the produce of the fields and the vineyards (Ex. 23:11;
      Lev. 25:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In the year of jubilee they recovered their property
      (Lev. 25:25-30).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be
      returned before the sun went down (Ex. 22:25-27; Deut.
      24:10-13). The rich were to be generous to the poor (Deut.
      15:7-11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) In the sabbatical and jubilee years the bond-servant
      was to go free (Deut. 15:12-15; Lev. 25:39-42, 47-54).
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) Certain portions from the tithes were assigned to the
      poor (Deut. 14:28, 29; 26:12, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) They shared in the feasts (Deut. 16:11, 14; Neh.
      8:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) Wages were to be paid at the close of each day (Lev.
      19:13).

    <p>
      In the New Testament (Luke 3:11; 14:13; Acts 6:1; Gal.
      2:10; James 2:15, 16) we have similar injunctions given
      with reference to the poor. Begging was not common under
      the Old Testament, while it was so in the New Testament
      times (Luke 16:20, 21, etc.). But begging in the case of
      those who are able to work is forbidden, and all such are
      enjoined to &quot;work with their own hands&quot; as a
      Christian duty (1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:7-13; Eph. 4:28).
      This word is used figuratively in Matt. 5:3; Luke 6:20; 2

      or meditation, but in direct address to him. Prayer may be
      oral or mental, occasional or constant, ejaculatory or
      formal. It is a &quot;beseeching the Lord&quot; (Ex.
      32:11); &quot;pouring out the soul before the Lord&quot; (1
      Sam. 1:15); &quot;praying and crying to heaven&quot; (2

      own insignificance as creatures and of our own unworthiness
      as sinners, with earnest importunity, and with unhesitating
      submission to the divine will. Prayer must also be offered
      in the faith that God is, and is the hearer and answerer of
      prayer, and that he will fulfil his word, &quot;Ask, and ye
      shall receive&quot; (Matt. 7:7, 8; 21:22; Mark 11:24; John
      14:13, 14), and in the name of Christ (16:23, 24; 15:16;
      Eph. 2:18; 5:20; Col. 3:17; 1 Pet. 2:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Prayer is of different kinds, secret (Matt. 6:6); social,
      as family prayers, and in social worship; and public, in
      the service of the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intercessory prayer is enjoined (Num. 6:23; Job 42:8; Isa.
      62:6; Ps. 122:6; 1 Tim. 2:1; James 5:14), and there are
      many instances on record of answers having been given to
      such prayers, e.g., of Abraham (Gen. 17:18, 20; 18:23-32;
      20:7, 17, 18), of Moses for Pharaoh (Ex. 8:12, 13, 30, 31;
      Ex. 9:33), for the Israelites (Ex. 17:11, 13; 32:11-14,
      31-34; Num. 21:7, 8; Deut. 9:18, 19, 25), for Miriam (Num.
      12:13), for Aaron (Deut. 9:20), of Samuel (1 Sam. 7:5-12),
      of Solomon (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6), Elijah (1 Kings
      17:20-23), Elisha (2 Kings 4:33-36), Isaiah (2 Kings 19),
      Jeremiah (42:2-10), Peter (Acts 9:40), the church
      (12:5-12), Paul (28:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      No rules are anywhere in Scripture laid down for the manner
      of prayer or the attitude to be assumed by the suppliant.
      There is mention made of kneeling in prayer (1 Kings 8:54;
      2 Chr. 6:13; Ps. 95:6; Isa. 45:23; Luke 22:41; Acts 7:60;
      9:40; Eph. 3:14, etc.); of bowing and falling prostrate
      (Gen. 24:26, 52; Ex. 4:31; 12:27; Matt. 26:39; Mark 14:35,
      etc.); of spreading out the hands (1 Kings 8:22, 38, 54;
      Ps. 28:2; 63:4; 88:9; 1 Tim. 2:8, etc.); and of standing (1
      Sam. 1:26; 1 Kings 8:14, 55; 2 Chr. 20:9; Mark 11:25; Luke
      18:11, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      If we except the &quot;Lord&#39;s Prayer&quot; (Matt.
      6:9-13), which is, however, rather a model or pattern of
      prayer than a set prayer to be offered up, we have no
      special form of prayer for general use given us in
      Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prayer is frequently enjoined in Scripture (Ex. 22:23, 27;
      1 Kings 3:5; 2 Chr. 7:14; Ps. 37:4; Isa. 55:6; Joel 2:32;
      Ezek. 36:37, etc.), and we have very many testimonies that
      it has been answered (Ps. 3:4; 4:1; 6:8; 18:6; 28:6; 30:2;
      34:4; 118:5; James 5:16-18, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Abraham&#39;s servant prayed to God, and God directed
      him to the person who should be wife to his master&#39;s
      son and heir (Gen. 24:10-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Jacob prayed to God, and God inclined the heart of
      his irritated brother, so that they met in peace and
      friendship (Gen. 32:24-30; 33:1-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Samson prayed to God, and God showed him a well where
      he quenched his burning thirst, and so lived to judge
      Israel (Judg. 15:18-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;David prayed, and God defeated the counsel of
      Ahithophel (2 Sam. 15:31; 16:20-23; 17:14-23).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Daniel prayed, and God enabled him both to tell
      Nebuchadnezzar his dream and to give the interpretation of
      it (Dan. 2: 16-23).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Nehemiah prayed, and God inclined the heart of the
      king of Persia to grant him leave of absence to visit and
      rebuild Jerusalem (Neh. 1:11; 2:1-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Esther and Mordecai prayed, and God defeated the
      purpose of Haman, and saved the Jews from destruction
      (Esther 4:15-17; 6:7, 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The believers in Jerusalem prayed, and God opened the
      prison doors and set Peter at liberty, when Herod had
      resolved upon his death (Acts 12:1-12).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Paul prayed that the thorn in the flesh might be
      removed, and his prayer brought a large increase of
      spiritual strength, while the thorn perhaps remained (2
      Cor. 12:7-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Prayer is like the dove that Noah sent forth, which
      blessed him not only when it returned with an olive-leaf in
      its mouth, but when it never returned at all.&quot;,
      Robinson&#39;s Job.

      <a name="T0002999"><b>Predestination -</b> This word is
      properly used only with reference to God&#39;s plan or
      purpose of salvation. The Greek word rendered
      &quot;predestinate&quot; is found only in these six
      passages, Acts 4:28; Rom. 8:29, 30; 1 Cor. 2:7; Eph. 1:5,
      11; and in all of them it has the same meaning. They teach
      that the eternal, sovereign, immutable, and unconditional
      decree or &quot;determinate purpose&quot; of God governs
      all events.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine of predestination or election is beset with
      many difficulties. It belongs to the &quot;secret
      things&quot; of God. But if we take the revealed word of
      God as our guide, we must accept this doctrine with all its
      mysteriousness, and settle all our questionings in the
      humble, devout acknowledgment, &quot;Even so, Father: for
      so it seemed good in thy sight.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the teaching of Scripture on this subject let the
      following passages be examined in addition to those
      referred to above; Gen. 21:12; Ex. 9:16; 33:19; Deut.
      10:15; 32:8; Josh. 11:20; 1 Sam. 12:22; 2 Chr. 6:6; Ps.
      33:12; 65:4; 78:68; 135:4; Isa. 41:1-10; Jer. 1:5; Mark
      13:20; Luke 22:22; John 6:37; 15:16; 17:2, 6, 9; Acts 2:28;
      3:18; 4:28; 13:48; 17:26; Rom. 9:11, 18, 21; 11:5; Eph.
      3:11; 1 Thess. 1:4; 2 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 1:9; Titus 1:2; 1
      Pet. 1:2. (See DECREES OF GOD &macr;T0001002; <a href=

      Hodge has well remarked that, &quot;rightly understood,
      this doctrine (1) exalts the majesty and absolute
      sovereignty of God, while it illustrates the riches of his
      free grace and his just displeasure with sin. (2.) It
      enforces upon us the essential truth that salvation is
      entirely of grace. That no one can either complain if
      passed over, or boast himself if saved. (3.) It brings the
      inquirer to absolute self-despair and the cordial embrace
      of the free offer of Christ. (4.) In the case of the
      believer who has the witness in himself, this doctrine at
      once deepens his humility and elevates his confidence to
      the full assurance of hope&quot; (Outlines).
