      <a name="T0003000"><b>Presidents -</b> Three presidents are
      mentioned, of whom Daniel was the first (Dan. 6:2-7). The
      name in the original is <i>sarkhin</i>, probably a Persian
      word meaning perfects or ministers.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003001"><b>Priest -</b> The Heb. kohen, Gr.
      hierus, Lat. sacerdos, always denote one who offers
      sacrifices.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At first every man was his own priest, and presented his
      own sacrifices before God. Afterwards that office devolved
      on the head of the family, as in the cases of Noah (Gen.
      8:20), Abraham (12:7; 13:4), Isaac (26:25), Jacob (31:54),
      and Job (Job 1:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The name first occurs as applied to Melchizedek (Gen.
      14:18). Under the Levitical arrangements the office of the
      priesthood was limited to the tribe of Levi, and to only
      one family of that tribe, the family of Aaron. Certain laws
      respecting the qualifications of priests are given in Lev.
      21:16-23. There are ordinances also regarding the
      priests&#39; dress (Ex. 28:40-43) and the manner of their
      consecration to the office (29:1-37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Their duties were manifold (Ex. 27:20, 21; 29:38-44; Lev.
      6:12; 10:11; 24:8; Num. 10:1-10; Deut. 17:8-13; 33:10; Mal.
      2:7). They represented the people before God, and offered
      the various sacrifices prescribed in the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of David the priests were divided into
      twenty-four courses or classes (1 Chr. 24:7-18). This
      number was retained after the Captivity (Ezra 2:36-39; Neh.
      7:39-42).
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The priests were not distributed over the country,
      but lived together in certain cities [forty-eight in
      number, of which six were cities of refuge, q.v.], which
      had been assigned to their use. From thence they went up by
      turns to minister in the temple at Jerusalem. Thus the
      religious instruction of the people in the country
      generally was left to the heads of families, until the
      establishment of synagogues, an event which did not take
      place till the return from the Captivity, and which was the
      main source of the freedom from idolatry that became as
      marked a feature of the Jewish people thenceforward as its
      practice had been hitherto their great national sin.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole priestly system of the Jews was typical. It was a
      shadow of which the body is Christ. The priests all
      prefigured the great Priest who offered &quot;one sacrifice
      for sins&quot; &quot;once for all&quot; (Heb. 10:10, 12).
      There is now no human priesthood. (See Epistle to the
      Hebrews throughout.) The term &quot;priest&quot; is indeed
      applied to believers (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6), but in these
      cases it implies no sacerdotal functions. All true
      believers are now &quot;kings and priests unto God.&quot;
      As priests they have free access into the holiest of all,
      and offer up the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and
      the sacrifices of grateful service from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003002"><b>Prince -</b> the title generally
      applied to the chief men of the state. The &quot;princes of
      the provinces&quot; (1 Kings 20:14) were the governors or
      lord-lieutenants of the provinces. So also the
      &quot;princes&quot; mentioned in Dan. 6:1, 3, 4, 6, 7 were
      the officers who administered the affairs of the provinces;
      the &quot;satraps&quot; (as rendered in R.V.). These are
      also called &quot;lieutenants&quot; (Esther 3:12; 8:9;
      R.V., &quot;satraps&quot;). The promised Saviour is called
      by Daniel (9:25) &quot;Messiah the Prince&quot; (Heb.
      nagid); compare Acts 3:15; 5:31. The angel Micheal is
      called (Dan. 12:1) a &quot;prince&quot; (Heb. sar, whence
      &quot;Sarah,&quot; the &quot;princes&quot;).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003003"><b>Priscilla -</b> the wife of Aquila
      (Acts 18:2), who is never mentioned without her. Her name
      sometimes takes the precedence of his (Rom. 16:3; 2 Tim.
      4:19). She took part with Aquila (q.v.) in insturcting
      Apollos (Acts 18:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003004"><b>Prison -</b> The first occasion on
      which we read of a prison is in the history of Joseph in
      Egypt. Then Potiphar, &quot;Joseph&#39;s master, took him,
      and put him into the prison, a place where the king&#39;s
      prisoners were bound&quot; (Gen. 39:20-23). The Heb. word
      here used (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress.
      It seems to have been a part of Potiphar&#39;s house, a
      place in which state prisoners were kept.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment as a
      punishment. In the wilderness two persons were &quot;put in
      ward&quot; (Lev. 24:12; Num. 15:34), but it was only till
      the mind of God concerning them should be ascertained.
      Prisons and prisoners are mentioned in the book of Psalms
      (69:33; 79:11; 142:7). Samson was confined in a Philistine
      prison (Judg. 16:21, 25). In the subsequent history of
      Israel frequent references are made to prisons (1 Kings
      22:27; 2 Kings 17:4; 25:27, 29; 2 Chr. 16:10; Isa. 42:7;
      Jer. 32:2). Prisons seem to have been common in New
      Testament times (Matt. 11:2; 25:36, 43). The apostles were
      put into the &quot;common prison&quot; at the instance of
      the Jewish council (Acts 5:18, 23; 8:3); and at Philippi
      Paul and Silas were thrust into the &quot;inner
      prison&quot; (16:24; comp. 4:3; 12:4, 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003005"><b>Prophecy -</b> or prediction, was one
      of the functions of the prophet. It has been defined as a
      &quot;miracle of knowledge, a declaration or description or
      representation of something future, beyond the power of
      human sagacity to foresee, discern, or conjecture.&quot;
      (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003000.html&amp;from=T0003006&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      PROPHET</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The great prediction which runs like a golden thread
      through the whole contents of the Old Testament is that
      regarding the coming and work of the Messiah; and the great
      use of prophecy was to perpetuate faith in his coming, and
      to prepare the world for that event. But there are many
      subordinate and intermediate prophecies also which hold an
      important place in the great chain of events which
      illustrate the sovereignty and all-wise overruling
      providence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish nation,
      its founder Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3; 13:16; 15:5; 17:2, 4-6,
      etc.), and his posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their
      descendants (12:7; 13:14, 15, 17; 15:18-21; Ex. 3:8, 17),
      which have all been fulfilled. The twenty-eighth chapter of
      Deuteronomy contains a series of predictions which are even
      now in the present day being fulfilled. In the writings of
      the prophets Isaiah (2:18-21), Jeremiah (27:3-7; 29:11-14),
      Ezekiel (5:12; 8), Daniel (8; 9:26, 27), Hosea (9:17),
      there are also many prophecies regarding the events which
      were to befall that people.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in like manner a large number of prophecies
      relating to those nations with which the Jews came into
      contact, as Tyre (Ezek. 26:3-5, 14-21), Egypt (Ezek. 29:10,
      15; 30:6, 12, 13), Ethiopia (Nahum 3:8-10), Nineveh (Nahum
      1:10; 2:8-13; 3:17-19), Babylon (Isa. 13:4; Jer. 51:7; Isa.
      44:27; Jer. 50:38; 51:36, 39, 57), the land of the
      Philistines (Jer. 47:4-7; Ezek. 25:15-17; Amos 1:6-8; Zeph.
      2:4-7; Zech. 9:5-8), and of the four great monarchies (Dan.
      2:39, 40; 7:17-24; 8:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      But the great body of Old Testament prophecy relates
      directly to the advent of the Messiah, beginning with Gen.
      3:15, the first great promise, and extending in
      ever-increasing fulness and clearness all through to the
      very close of the canon. The Messianic prophecies are too
      numerous to be quoted. &quot;To him gave all the prophets
      witness.&quot; (Comp. Micah 5:2; Hag. 2:6-9; Isa. 7:14;
      9:6, 7; 11:1, 2; 53; 60:10, 13; Ps. 16:11; 68:18.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Many predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his
      apostles. Those of Christ were very numerous. (Comp. Matt.
      10:23:24; 11:23; 19:28; 21:43, 44; 24; 25:31-46; 26:17-35,
      46, 64; Mark 9:1; 10:30; 13; 11:1-6, 14; 14:12-31, 42, 62;
      16:17, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003006"><b>Prophet -</b> (Heb. nabi, from a root
      meaning &quot;to bubble forth, as from a fountain,&quot;
      hence &quot;to utter&quot;, comp. Ps. 45:1). This Hebrew
      word is the first and the most generally used for a
      prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, <i>
      ro&#39;eh</i>, &quot;seer&quot;, began to be used (1 Sam.
      9:9). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel.
      Afterwards another word, <i>hozeh</i>, &quot;seer&quot; (2
      Sam. 24:11), was employed. In 1 Ch. 29:29 all these three
      words are used: &quot;Samuel the seer (ro&#39;eh), Nathan
      the prophet (nabi&#39;), Gad the seer&quot; (hozeh). In
      Josh. 13:22 Balaam is called (Heb.) a <i>kosem</i>
      &quot;diviner,&quot; a word used only of a false
      prophet.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;prophet&quot; proclaimed the message given to
      him, as the &quot;seer&quot; beheld the vision of God. (See
      Num. 12:6, 8.) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he
      spake in God&#39;s name and by his authority (Ex. 7:1). He
      is the mouth by which God speaks to men (Jer. 1:9; Isa.
      51:16), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but
      of God (2 Pet. 1:20, 21; comp. Heb. 3:7; Acts 4:25; 28:25).
      Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the
      communication of his mind and will to men (Deut. 18:18,
      19). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be
      spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men
      who received the revelation they communicated from God, no
      matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future
      events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of
      the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the
      prophets whom God raised up among the people was &quot;to
      correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great
      moral and religious truths which are connected with the
      character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his
      government.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be
      called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs,
      as bearers of God&#39;s message (Gen. 20:7; Ex. 7:1; Ps.
      105:15), as also Moses (Deut. 18:15; 34:10; Hos. 12:13),
      are ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel
      (Num. 11:16-29), &quot;when the spirit rested upon them,
      prophesied;&quot; Asaph and Jeduthun &quot;prophesied with
      a harp&quot; (1 Chr. 25:3). Miriam and Deborah were
      prophetesses (Ex. 15:20; Judg. 4:4). The title thus has a
      general application to all who have messages from God to
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the
      beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel.
      Colleges, &quot;schools of the prophets&quot;, were
      instituted for the training of prophets, who were
      constituted, a distinct order (1 Sam. 19:18-24; 2 Kings
      2:3, 15; 4:38), which continued to the close of the Old
      Testament. Such &quot;schools&quot; were established at
      Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The
      &quot;sons&quot; or &quot;disciples&quot; of the prophets
      were young men (2 Kings 5:22; 9:1, 4) who lived together at
      these different &quot;schools&quot; (4:38-41). These young
      men were taught not only the rudiments of secular
      knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office
      of prophet, &quot;to preach pure morality and the
      heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and
      co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding
      the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality
      and tyranny.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In New Testament times the prophetical office was
      continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet
      (Luke 13:33; 24:19). He was and is the great Prophet of the
      Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of
      prophets (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 2:20; 3:5), who made new
      revelations from God. They differed from the
      &quot;teacher,&quot; whose office it was to impart truths
      already revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose
      prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are
      divided into four groups:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz.,
      Hosea, Amos, Joel, Jonah.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah,
      Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai,
      Zechariah, and Malachi.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003007"><b>Propitiation -</b> that by which God
      is rendered propitious, i.e., by which it becomes
      consistent with his character and government to pardon and
      bless the sinner. The propitiation does not procure his
      love or make him loving; it only renders it consistent for
      him to execise his love towards sinners.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rom. 3:25 and Heb. 9:5 (A.V., &quot;mercy-seat&quot;)
      the Greek word <i>hilasterion</i> is used. It is the word
      employed by the LXX. translators in Ex. 25:17 and elsewhere
      as the equivalent for the Hebrew <i>kapporeth</i>, which
      means &quot;covering,&quot; and is used of the lid of the
      ark of the covenant (Ex. 25:21; 30:6). This Greek word
      (hilasterion) came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid
      of the ark, but also propitation or reconciliation by
      blood. On the great day of atonement the high priest
      carried the blood of the sacrifice he offered for all the
      people within the veil and sprinkled with it the
      &quot;mercy-seat,&quot; and so made propitiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1 John 2:2; 4:10, Christ is called the
      &quot;propitiation for our sins.&quot; Here a different
      Greek word is used (hilasmos). Christ is &quot;the
      propitiation,&quot; because by his becoming our substitute
      and assuming our obligations he expiated our guilt, covered
      it, by the vicarious punishment which he endured. (Comp.
      Heb. 2:17, where the expression &quot;make
      reconciliation&quot; of the A.V. is more correctly in the
      R.V. &quot;make propitiation.&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003008"><b>Proportion of faith -</b> (Rom.
      12:6). Paul says here that each one was to exercise his
      gift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, &quot;according to the
      proportion of faith.&quot; The meaning is, that the
      utterances of the &quot;prophet&quot; were not to fluctuate
      according to his own impulses or independent thoughts, but
      were to be adjusted to the truth revealed to him as a
      beliver, i.e., were to be in accordance with it.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In post-Reformation times this phrase was used as meaning
      that all Scripture was to be interpreted with reference to
      all other Scripture, i.e., that no words or expressions
      were to be isolated or interpreted in a way contrary to its
      general teaching. This was also called the &quot;analogy of
      faith.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003009"><b>Proselyte -</b> is used in the LXX.
      for &quot;stranger&quot; (1 Chr. 22:2), i.e., a comer to
      Palestine; a sojourner in the land (Ex. 12:48; 20:10;
      22:21), and in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism.
      There were such converts from early times (Isa. 56:3; Neh.
      10:28; Esther 8:17). The law of Moses made specific
      regulations regarding the admission into the Jewish church
      of such as were not born Israelites (Ex. 20:10; 23:12;
      12:19, 48; Deut. 5:14; 16:11, 14, etc.). The Kenites, the
      Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus
      admitted to the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear
      of individual proselytes who rose to positions of
      prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the
      Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah
      and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Solomon there were one hundred and
      fifty-three thousand six hundred strangers in the land of
      Israel (1 Chr. 22:2; 2 Chr. 2:17, 18). And the prophets
      speak of the time as coming when the strangers shall share
      in all the privileges of Israel (Ezek. 47:22; Isa. 2:2;
      11:10; 56:3-6; Micah 4:1). Accordingly, in New Testament
      times, we read of proselytes in the synagogues, (Acts 10:2,
      7; 13:42, 43, 50; 17:4; 18:7; Luke 7:5). The
      &quot;religious proselytes&quot; here spoken of were
      proselytes of righteousness, as distinguished from
      proselytes of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinction between &quot;proselytes of the gate&quot;
      (Ex. 20:10) and &quot;proselytes of righteousness&quot;
      originated only with the rabbis. According to them, the
      &quot;proselytes of the gate&quot; (half proselytes) were
      not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the
      Mosaic ceremonial law. They were bound only to conform to
      the so-called seven precepts of Noah, viz., to abstain from
      idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleaness, the eating of
      blood, theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities.
      Besides these laws, however, they were required to abstain
      from work on the Sabbath, and to refrain from the use of
      leavened bread during the time of the Passover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;proselytes of righteousness&quot;, religious or
      devout proselytes (Acts 13:43), were bound to all the
      doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and were
      members of the synagogue in full communion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name &quot;proselyte&quot; occurs in the New Testament
      only in Matt. 23:15; Acts 2:10; 6:5; 13:43. The name by
      which they are commonly designated is that of &quot;devout
      men,&quot; or men &quot;fearing God&quot; or
      &quot;worshipping God.&quot;

      Rendered &quot;proverb&quot; in Isa. 14:4; Hab. 2:6;

      <a name="T0003011"><b>Proverbs, Book of -</b> a collection
      of moral and philosophical maxims of a wide range of
      subjects presented in a poetic form. This book sets forth
      the &quot;philosophy of practical life. It is the sign to
      us that the Bible does not despise common sense and
      discretion. It impresses upon us in the most forcible
      manner the value of intelligence and prudence and of a good
      education. The whole strength of the Hebrew language and of
      the sacred authority of the book is thrown upon these
      homely truths. It deals, too, in that refined,
      discriminating, careful view of the finer shades of human
      character so often overlooked by theologians, but so
      necessary to any true estimate of human life&quot;
      (Stanley&#39;s Jewish Church).</a>

    <p>
      As to the origin of this book, &quot;it is probable that
      Solomon gathered and recast many proverbs which sprang from
      human experience in preceeding ages and were floating past
      him on the tide of time, and that he also elaborated many
      new ones from the material of his own experience. Towards
      the close of the book, indeed, are preserved some of
      Solomon&#39;s own sayings that seem to have fallen from his
      lips in later life and been gathered by other hands&#39;
      (Arnot&#39;s Laws from Heaven, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This book is usually divided into three parts: (1.)
      Consisting of ch. 1-9, which contain an exhibition of
      wisdom as the highest good.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Consisting of ch. 10-24.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Containing proverbs of Solomon &quot;which the men of
      Hezekiah, the king of Judah, collected&quot; (ch. 25-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      These are followed by two supplements, (1) &quot;The words
      of Agur&quot; (ch. 30); and (2) &quot;The words of king
      Lemuel&quot; (ch. 31).
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon is said to have written three thousand proverbs,
      and those contained in this book may be a selection from
      these (1 Kings 4:32). In the New Testament there are
      thirty-five direct quotations from this book or allusions
      to it.

      <a name="T0003012"><b>Providence -</b> literally means
      foresight, but is generally used to denote God&#39;s
      preserving and governing all things by means of second
      causes (Ps. 18:35; 63:8; Acts 17:28; Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3).
      God&#39;s providence extends to the natural world (Ps.
      104:14; 135:5-7; Acts 14:17), the brute creation (Ps.
      104:21-29; Matt. 6:26; 10:29), and the affairs of men (1
      Chr. 16:31; Ps. 47:7; Prov. 21:1; Job 12:23; Dan. 2:21;
      4:25), and of individuals (1 Sam. 2:6; Ps. 18:30; Luke
      1:53; James 4:13-15). It extends also to the free actions
      of men (Ex. 12:36; 1 Sam. 24:9-15; Ps. 33:14, 15; Prov.
      16:1; 19:21; 20:24; 21:1), and things sinful (2 Sam. 16:10;
      24:1; Rom. 11:32; Acts 4:27, 28), as well as to their good
      actions (Phil. 2:13; 4:13; 2 Cor. 12:9, 10; Eph. 2:10; Gal.
      5:22-25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards sinful actions of men, they are represented as
      occurring by God&#39;s permission (Gen. 45:5; 50:20. Comp.
      1 Sam. 6:6; Ex. 7:13; 14:17; Acts 2:3; 3:18; 4:27, 28), and
      as controlled (Ps. 76:10) and overruled for good (Gen.
      50:20; Acts 3:13). God does not cause or approve of sin,
      but only limits, restrains, overrules it for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mode of God&#39;s providential government is altogether
      unexplained. We only know that it is a fact that God does
      govern all his creatures and all their actions; that this
      government is universal (Ps. 103:17-19), particular (Matt.
      10:29-31), efficacious (Ps. 33:11; Job 23:13), embraces
      events apparently contingent (Prov. 16:9, 33; 19:21; 21:1),
      is consistent with his own perfection (2 Tim. 2:13), and to
      his own glory (Rom. 9:17; 11:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003013"><b>Psalms -</b> The psalms are the
      production of various authors. &quot;Only a portion of the
      Book of Psalms claims David as its author. Other inspired
      poets in successive generations added now one now another
      contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the
      wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every
      phase of human emotion and circumstances than it otherwise
      could.&quot; But it is specially to David and his
      contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the
      &quot;titles&quot; of the psalms, the genuineness of which
      there is no sufficient reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to
      David. Peter and John (Acts 4:25) ascribe to him also the
      second psalm, which is one of the 48 that are anonymous.
      About two-thirds of the whole collection have been ascribed
      to David.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Psalms 39, 62, and 77 are addressed to Jeduthun, to be sung
      after his manner or in his choir. Psalms 50 and 73-83 are
      addressed to Asaph, as the master of his choir, to be sung
      in the worship of God. The &quot;sons of Korah,&quot; who
      formed a leading part of the Kohathite singers (2 Chr.
      20:19), were intrusted with the arranging and singing of
      Ps. 42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87, and 88.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Luke 24:44 the word &quot;psalms&quot; means the
      Hagiographa, i.e., the holy writings, one of the sections
      into which the Jews divided the Old Testament. (See <a
      href=

      BIBLE</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the psalms can be proved to have been of a later
      date than the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, hence the whole
      collection extends over a period of about 1,000 years.
      There are in the New Testament 116 direct quotations from
      the Psalter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psalter is divided, after the analogy of the
      Pentateuch, into five books, each closing with a doxology
      or benediction:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) The first book comprises the first 41 psalms, all of
      which are ascribed to David except 1, 2, 10, and 33, which,
      though anonymous, may also be ascribed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Book second consists of the next 31 psalms (42-72), 18
      of which are ascribed to David and 1 to Solomon (the 72nd).
      The rest are anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The third book contains 17 psalms (73-89), of which
      the 86th is ascribed to David, the 88th to Heman the
      Ezrahite, and the 89th to Ethan the Ezrahite.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The fourth book also contains 17 psalms (90-106), of
      which the 90th is ascribed to Moses, and the 101st and
      103rd to David.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) The fifth book contains the remaining psalms, 44 in
      number. Of these, 15 are ascribed to David, and the 127th
      to Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ps. 136 is generally called &quot;the great hallel.&quot;
      But the Talmud includes also Ps. 120-135. Ps. 113-118,
      inclusive, constitute the &quot;hallel&quot; recited at the
      three great feasts, at the new moon, and on the eight days
      of the feast of dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;It is presumed that these several collections were
      made at times of high religious life: the first, probably,
      near the close of David&#39;s life; the second in the days
      of Solomon; the third by the singers of Jehoshaphat (2 Chr.
      20:19); the fourth by the men of Hezekiah (29, 30, 31); and
      the fifth in the days of Ezra.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mosaic ritual makes no provision for the service of
      song in the worship of God. David first taught the Church
      to sing the praises of the Lord. He first introduced into
      the ritual of the tabernacle music and song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divers names are given to the psalms. (1.) Some bear the
      Hebrew designation <i>shir</i> (Gr. ode, a song). Thirteen
      have this title. It means the flow of speech, as it were,
      in a straight line or in a regular strain. This title
      includes secular as well as sacred song.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Fifty-eight psalms bear the designation (Heb.) <i>
      mitsmor</i> (Gr. psalmos, a psalm), a lyric ode, or a song
      set to music; a sacred song accompanied with a musical
      instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Ps. 145, and many others, have the designation (Heb.)
      <i>tehillah</i> (Gr. hymnos, a hymn), meaning a song of
      praise; a song the prominent thought of which is the praise
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Six psalms (16, 56-60) have the title (Heb.) <i>
      michtam</i> (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Ps. 7 and Hab. 3 bear the title (Heb.) <i>
      shiggaion</i> (q.v.).
    </p>

      strings. The Hebrew word nebhel, so rendered, is translated
      &quot;viol&quot; in Isa. 5:12 (R.V., &quot;lute&quot;);
      14:11. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word thus rendered is
      Chaldaic, pesanterin, which is supposed to be a word of
      Greek origin denoting an instrument of the harp kind.</a>

      or district, and thus undertook to pay to the supreme
      government a certain amount. In order to collect the taxes,
      the publicans employed subordinates (5:27; 15:1; 18:10),
      who, for their own ends, were often guilty of extortion and
      peculation. In New Testament times these taxes were paid to
      the Romans, and hence were regarded by the Jews as a very
      heavy burden, and hence also the collectors of taxes, who
      were frequently Jews, were hated, and were usually spoken
      of in very opprobrious terms. Jesus was accused of being a
      &quot;friend of publicans and sinners&quot; (Luke
      7:34).</a>

      for they remained on the island for three months, till the

      has been a question whether he was identical with
      Tiglath-pileser III. (q.v.), or was his predecessor. The
      weight of evidence is certainly in favour of their
      identity. Pul was the throne-name he bore in Babylonia as
      king of Babylon, and Tiglath-pileser the throne-name he
      bore as king of Assyria. He was the founder of what is
      called the second Assyrian empire. He consolidated and
      organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued
      Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered
      him homage and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found
      in Western Asia a kingdom which should embrace the whole
      civilized world, having Nineveh as its centre. Menahem,
      king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of a thousand
      talents of silver, &quot;that his hand might be with
      him&quot; (2 Kings 15:19; 1 Chr. 5:26). The fact that this
      tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the
      little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and
      misgovernment. Having reduced Syria, he turned his arms
      against Babylon, which he subdued. The Babylonian king was
      slain, and Babylon and other Chaldean cities were taken,
      and Pul assumed the title of &quot;King of Sumer [i.e.,
      Shinar] and Accad.&quot; He was succeeded by Shalmanezer

      distinction must be maintained for its own sake. It is not
      primarily intended for the reformation of criminals, nor

      and washing the clothes (Lev. 14:8, 9); by washing the
      hands (Deut. 21:6; Matt. 27:24); washing the hands and feet
      (Ex. 30:18-21; Heb. 6:2, &quot;baptisms&quot;, R.V. marg.,
      &quot;washings;&quot; 9:10); sprinkling with blood and
      water (Ex. 24:5-8; Heb. 9:19), etc. Allusions to this rite
      are found in Ps. 26:6; 51:7; Ezek. 36:25; Heb. 10:22.

      <a name="T0003030"><b>Quails -</b> The Israelites were
      twice relieved in their privation by a miraculous supply of
      quails, (1) in the wilderness of Sin (Ex. 16:13), and (2)
      again at Kibroth-hattaavah (q.v.), Num. 11:31. God
      &quot;rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
      like as the sand of the sea&quot; (Ps. 78:27). The words in
      Num. 11:31, according to the Authorized Version, appear to
      denote that the quails lay one above another to the
      thickness of two cubits above the ground. The Revised
      Version, however, reads, &quot;about two cubits above the
      face of the earth&quot;, i.e., the quails flew at this
      height, and were easily killed or caught by the hand. Being
      thus secured in vast numbers by the people, they
      &quot;spread them all abroad&quot; (11:32) in order to salt
      and dry them.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      These birds (the Coturnix vulgaris of naturalists) are
      found in countless numbers on the shores of the

      <a name="T0003031"><b>Quarantania -</b> a mountain some
      1,200 feet high, about 7 miles north-west of Jericho, the
      traditional scene of our Lord&#39;s temptation (Matt.
      4:8).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003032"><b>Quarries -</b> (1.) The &quot;Royal
      Quarries&quot; (not found in Scripture) is the name given
      to the vast caverns stretching far underneath the northern
      hill, Bezetha, on which Jerusalem is built. Out of these
      mammoth caverns stones, a hard lime-stone, have been
      quarried in ancient times for the buildings in the city,
      and for the temples of Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod. Huge
      blocks of stone are still found in these caves bearing the
      marks of pick and chisel. The general appearance of the
      whole suggests to the explorer the idea that the Phoenician
      quarrymen have just suspended their work. The supposition
      that the polished blocks of stone for Solomon&#39;s temple
      were sent by Hiram from Lebanon or Tyre is not supported by
      any evidence (comp. 1 Kings 5:8). Hiram sent masons and
      stone-squarers to Jerusalem to assist Solomon&#39;s workmen
      in their great undertaking, but did not send stones to
      Jerusalem, where, indeed, they were not needed, as these
      royal quarries abundantly testify.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The &quot;quarries&quot; (Heb. pesilim) by Gilgal
      (Judg. 3:19), from which Ehud turned back for the purpose
      of carrying out his design to put Eglon king of Moab to
      death, were probably the &quot;graven images&quot; (as the
      word is rendered by the LXX. and the Vulgate and in the
      marg. A.V. and R.V.), or the idol temples the Moabites had
      erected at Gilgal, where the children of Israel first
      encamped after crossing the Jordan. The Hebrew word is
      rendered &quot;graven images&quot; in Deut. 7:25, and is
      not elsewhere translated &quot;quarries.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0003034"><b>Quaternion -</b> a band of four
      soldiers. Peter was committed by Herod to the custody of
      four quaternions, i.e., one quaternion for each watch of
      the night (Acts 12:4). Thus every precaution was taken
      against his escape from prison. Two of each quaternion were
      in turn stationed at the door (12:6), and to two the
      apostle was chained according to Roman custom.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003035"><b>Queen -</b> No explicit mention of
      queens is made till we read of the &quot;queen of
      Sheba.&quot; The wives of the kings of Israel are not so
      designated. In Ps. 45:9, the Hebrew for &quot;queen&quot;
      is not <i>malkah</i>, one actually ruling like the Queen of
      Sheba, but <i>shegal</i>, which simply means the king&#39;s
      wife. In 1 Kings 11:19, Pharaoh&#39;s wife is called
      &quot;the queen,&quot; but the Hebrew word so rendered
      (g&#39;birah) is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal
      lady, used sometimes for &quot;queen-mother&quot; (1 Kings
      15:13; 2 Chron. 15:16). In Cant. 6:8, 9, the king&#39;s
      wives are styled &quot;queens&quot; (Heb. melakhoth).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament we read of the &quot;queen of the
      south&quot;, i.e., Southern Arabia, Sheba (Matt. 12:42;
      Luke 11:31) and the &quot;queen of the Ethiopians&quot;
      (Acts 8:27), Candace.

      27:17, the rendering of the Greek Syrtis. On the north
      coast of Africa were two localities dangerous to sailors,
      called the Greater and Lesser Syrtis. The former of these
      is probably here meant. It lies between Tripoli and Barca,
      and near Cyrene. The Lesser Syrtis lay farther to the
      west.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003038"><b>Quiver -</b> the sheath for arrows.
      The Hebrew word (aspah) thus commonly rendered is found in
      Job 39:23; Ps. 127:5; Isa. 22:6; 49:2; Jer. 5:16; Lam.
      3:13. In Gen. 27:3 this word is the rendering of the Hebrew
      <i>teli</i>, which is supposed rather to mean a suspended
      weapon, literally &quot;that which hangs from one&quot;,
      i.e., is suspended from the shoulder or girdle.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003039"><b>Quotations -</b> from the Old
      Testament in the New, which are very numerous, are not made
      according to any uniform method. When the New Testament was
      written, the Old was not divided, as it now is, into
      chapters and verses, and hence such peculiarities as these:
      When Luke (20:37) refers to Ex. 3:6, he quotes from
      &quot;Moses at the bush&quot;, i.e., the section containing
      the record of Moses at the bush. So also Mark (2:26) refers
      to 1 Sam. 21:1-6, in the words, &quot;in the days of
      Abiathar;&quot; and Paul (Rom. 11:2) refers to 1 Kings ch.
      17-19, in the words, &quot;in Elias&quot;, i.e., in the
      portion of the history regarding Elias.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the New Testament writers quote from the
      Septuagint (q.v.) version of the Old Testament, as it was
      then in common use among the Jews. But it is noticeable
      that these quotations are not made in any uniform manner.
      Sometimes, e.g., the quotation does not agree literally
      either with the LXX. or the Hebrew text. This occurs in
      about one hundred instances. Sometimes the LXX. is
      literally quoted (in about ninety instances), and sometimes
      it is corrected or altered in the quotations (in over
      eighty instances).
    </p>
    <p>
      Quotations are sometimes made also directly from the Hebrew
      text (Matt. 4:15, 16; John 19:37; 1 Cor. 15:54). Besides
      the quotations made directly, there are found numberless
      allusions, more or less distinct, showing that the minds of
      the New Testament writers were filled with the expressions
      and ideas as well as historical facts recorded in the Old.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are in all two hundred and eighty-three direct
      quotations from the Old Testament in the New, but not one
      clear and certain case of quotation from the Apocrypha
      (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides quotations in the New from the Old Testament, there
      are in Paul&#39;s writings three quotations from certain
      Greek poets, Acts 17:28; 1 Cor. 15:33; Titus 1:12. These
      quotations are memorials of his early classical education.

      (1.) &quot;Rabbath of the children of Ammon,&quot; the
      chief city of the Ammonites, among the eastern hills, some
      20 miles east of the Jordan, on the southern of the two
      streams which united with the Jabbok. Here the bedstead of
      Og was preserved (Deut. 3:11), perhaps as a trophy of some
      victory gained by the Ammonites over the king of Bashan.
      After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he
      sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two
      years it held out against its assailants. It was while his
      army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was
      guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his
      character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At
      length, having taken the &quot;royal city&quot; (or the
      &quot;city of waters,&quot; 2 Sam. 12:27, i.e., the lower
      city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab
      sent for David to direct the final assault (11:1;
      12:26-31). The city was given up to plunder, and the people
      were ruthlessly put to death, and &quot;thus did he with
      all the cities of the children of Ammon.&quot; The
      destruction of Rabbath was the last of David&#39;s
      conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits (2
      Sam. 8:1-15; 1 Chr. 18:1-15). The capture of this city is

      served Laban fourteen years for her, so deep was
      Jacob&#39;s affection for her. She was the mother of Joseph
      (Gen. 30:22-24). Afterwards, on Jacob&#39;s departure from
      Mesopotamia, she took with her her father&#39;s teraphim
      (31:34, 35). As they journeyed on from Bethel, Rachel died

      Rahab, (Heb. Rahab; i.e., &quot;broad,&quot;
      &quot;large&quot;). When the Hebrews were encamped at
      Shittim, in the &quot;Arabah&quot; or Jordan valley
      opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a
      final preparation, sent out two spies to &quot;spy the
      land.&quot; After five days they returned, having swum
      across the river, which at this season, the month Abib,
      overflowed its banks from the melting of the snow on
      Lebanon. The spies reported how it had fared with them
      (Josh. 2:1-7). They had been exposed to danger in Jericho,
      and had been saved by the fidelity of Rahab the harlot, to
      whose house they had gone for protection. When the city of
      Jericho fell (6:17-25), Rahab and her whole family were
      preserved according to the promise of the spies, and were
      incorporated among the Jewish people. She afterwards became
      the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah (Ruth
      4:21; 1 Chr. 2:11; Matt. 1:5). &quot;Rahab&#39;s being
      asked to bring out the spies to the soldiers (Josh. 2:3)
      sent for them, is in strict keeping with Eastern manners,
      which would not permit any man to enter a woman&#39;s house
      without her permission. The fact of her covering the spies
      with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is
      an &#39;undesigned coincidence&#39; which strictly
      corroborates the narrative. It was the time of the barley
      harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in
      the Jordan valley, so that the bundles of flax stalks might
      have been expected to be drying just then&quot;
      (Geikie&#39;s Hours, etc., ii., 390).

      Yoreh (Hos. 6:3), or moreh (Joel 2:23), denoting the former

      &quot;the rains.&quot; The heavy winter rain is mentioned
      in Gen. 7:12; Ezra 10:9; Cant. 2:11. The &quot;early&quot;
      or &quot;former&quot; rains commence in autumn in the
      latter part of October or beginning of November (Deut.
      11:14; Joel 2:23; comp. Jer. 3:3), and continue to fall
      heavily for two months. Then the heavy &quot;winter
      rains&quot; fall from the middle of December to March.
      There is no prolonged fair weather in Palestine between
      October and March. The &quot;latter&quot; or spring rains
      fall in March and April, and serve to swell the grain then
      coming to maturity (Deut. 11:14; Hos. 6:3). After this
      there is ordinarily no rain, the sky being bright and
      cloudless till October or November.</a>

      that it &quot;appeared then for the first time in the vault

      this opinion that the atmosphere was differently

      of Israel (1 Kings 15:17-22; 2 Chr. 16:1-6). Asa, king of
      Judah, employed Benhadad the Syrian king to drive Baasha
      from this city (1 Kings 15:18, 20). Isaiah (10:29) refers
      to it, and also Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there
      among the other captives of Jerusalem when it was taken by
      Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 39:8-12; 40:1). Rachel, whose tomb
      lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in Ramah
      (Jer. 31:15) for her slaughtered children. This prophecy is
      illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of
      Rachel&#39;s grief at the slaughter of the infants in
      Bethlehem (Matt. 2:18). It is identified with the modern

    <p>
      One of the Levitical families descended from Kohath, that
      of Zuph or Zophai (1 Chr. 6:26, 35), had a district
      assigned to them in Ephraim, which from this circumstance
      was called &quot;the land of Zuph,&quot; and hence the name
      of the town, &quot;Zophim.&quot; It was the birth-place of
      Samuel and the seat of his authority (1 Sam. 2:11; 7:17).
      It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet
      and of David (15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23). Here Samuel died and
      was buried (25:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil
      (&quot;the prophet Samuel&quot;), about 4 or 5 miles
      north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to
      its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be
      identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (See MIZPAH

      Mizpeh or of the watch-tower (Josh. 13:26), a place
      mentioned as one of the limits of Gad. There were two
      Mizpehs on the east of the Jordan. This was the Mizpeh
      where Jacob and Laban made a covenant, &quot;Mizpeh of
      Gilead,&quot; called also Galeed and Jegar-sahadutha. It
      has been identified with the modern es-Salt, where the
      roads from Jericho and from Shechem to Damascus unite,
      about 25 miles east of the Jordan and 13 south of the

      Ramath-negeb). The Heb. negeb is the general designation
      for south or south-west of Judah. This was one of the towns

      Ramoth&quot; (1 Sam. 30:27; R.V., &quot;Ramoth of the

      the &quot;treasure cities,&quot; it came to be known as the
      &quot;land&quot; in which that city was built.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The city bearing this name (Ex. 12:37) was probably
      identical with Zoan, which Rameses II. (&quot;son of the
      sun&quot;) rebuilt. It became his special residence, and
      ranked next in importance and magnificance to Thebes. Huge
      masses of bricks, made of Nile mud, sun-dried, some of them
      mixed with stubble, possibly moulded by Jewish hands, still
      mark the site of Rameses. This was the general rendezvous
      of the Israelites before they began their march out of
      Egypt. Called also Raamses (Ex. 1:11).

      21:38). Here Ahab, who joined Jehoshaphat in an endeavour
      to rescue it from the hands of the king of Syria, was
      mortally wounded (1 Kings 22:1-36). A similar attempt was
      afterwards made by Ahaziah and Joram, when the latter was
      wounded (2 Kings 8:28). In this city Jehu, the son of
      Jehoshaphat, was anointed by one of the sons of the
      prophets (9:1, 4).</a>

      It has with probability been identified with Reimun, on the
      northern slope of the Jabbok, about 5 miles west of Jerash
      or Gerasa, one of the cities of Decapolis. Others identify
      it with Gerosh, about 25 miles north-east of es-Salt, with
      which also many have identified it. (See RAMATH-MIZPEH

      fire-place fitted to receive a pair of ovens.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) 2 Kings 11:8. A Hebrew word is here used different
      from the preceding, meaning &quot;ranks of soldiers.&quot;
      The Levites were appointed to guard the king&#39;s person
      within the temple (2 Chr. 23:7), while the soldiers were
      his guard in the court, and in going from the temple to the
      palace. The soldiers are here commanded to slay any one who
      should break through the &quot;ranks&quot; (as rendered in
      the R.V.) to come near the king. In 2 Kings 11:15 the
      expression, &quot;Have her forth without the ranges,&quot;
      is in the Revised Version, &quot;Have her forth between the
      ranks;&quot; i.e., Jehoiada orders that Athaliah should be
      kept surrounded by his own guards, and at the same time
      conveyed beyond the precincts of the temple.

      Gal. 3:13; 4:4, 5: Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 Tim. 2:6; Titus
      2:14; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19. In all these passages the same idea
      is expressed). This word is derived from the Fr. rancon;
      Lat. redemptio. The debt is represented not as cancelled
      but as fully paid. The slave or captive is not liberated by
      a mere gratuitous favour, but a ransom price has been paid,
      in consideration of which he is set free. The original
      owner receives back his alienated and lost possession
      because he has bought it back &quot;with a price.&quot;
      This price or ransom (Gr. lutron) is always said to be
      Christ, his blood, his death. He secures our redemption by
      the payment of a ransom. (See <a href=

      mostly on carrion, and hence their food is procured with
      difficulty (Job 38:41; Ps. 147:9). When they attack kids or
      lambs or weak animals, it is said that they first pick out
      the eyes of their victims (Prov. 30:17). When Elijah was

      Kenites (1 Sam. 15:6). The main body of the Kenites dwelt
      in cities, and adopted settled habits of life (30:29); but
      Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live
      in cities. They were commanded to lead always a nomad life.
      They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were
      noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of
      their family in the days of Jeremiah (35); and this feature
      of their character is referred to by the prophet for the
      purpose of giving point to his own exhortation. They are
      referred to in Neh. 3:14 and 1 Chr. 2:55. Dr. Wolff (1839)

      (1.) In Col. 1:21, 22, the word there used refers to a
      change wrought in the personal character of the sinner who
      ceases to be an enemy to God by wicked works, and yields up
      to him his full confidence and love. In 2 Cor. 5:20 the
      apostle beseeches the Corinthians to be &quot;reconciled to
      God&quot;, i.e., to lay aside their enmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Rom. 5:10 refers not to any change in our disposition
      toward God, but to God himself, as the party reconciled.
      Romans 5:11 teaches the same truth. From God we have
      received &quot;the reconciliation&quot; (R.V.), i.e., he
      has conferred on us the token of his friendship. So also 2
      Cor. 5:18, 19 speaks of a reconciliation originating with
      God, and consisting in the removal of his merited wrath. In
      Eph. 2:16 it is clear that the apostle does not refer to
      the winning back of the sinner in love and loyalty to God,
      but to the restoration of God&#39;s forfeited favour. This
      is effected by his justice being satisfied, so that he can,
      in consistency with his own nature, be favourable toward
      sinners. Justice demands the punishment of sinners. The
      death of Christ satisfies justice, and so reconciles God to
      us. This reconciliation makes God our friend, and enables
      him to pardon and save us. (See <a href=

      office first held by Jehoshaphat in the court of David (2
      Sam. 8:16), also in the court of Solomon (1 Kings 4:3). The
      next recorder mentioned is Joah, in the reign of Hezekiah
      (2 Kings 18:18, 37; Isa. 36:3, 22). In the reign of Josiah
      another of the name of Joah filled this office (2 Chr.
      34:8). The &quot;recorder&quot; was the chancellor or
      vizier of the kingdom. He brought all weighty matters under
      the notice of the king, &quot;such as complaints,
      petitions, and wishes of subjects or foreigners. He also
      drew up papers for the king&#39;s guidance, and prepared
      drafts of the royal will for the scribes. All treaties came
      under his oversight; and he had the care of the national
      archives or records, to which, as royal historiographer,
      like the same state officer in Assyria and Egypt, he added
      the current annals of the kingdom.&quot;</a>

      4:1; Job 19:25; Ps. 19:14; 78:35, etc.). This title is
      peculiarly applied to Christ. He redeems us from all evil
      by the payment of a ransom (q.v.). (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003000.html&amp;from=T0003084&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      REDEMPTION</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003084"><b>Redemption -</b> the purchase back of
      something that had been lost, by the payment of a ransom.
      The Greek word so rendered is <i>apolutrosis</i>, a word
      occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with the idea
      of a ransom or price paid, i.e., redemption by a lutron
      (see Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45). There are instances in the
      LXX. Version of the Old Testament of the use of <i>
      lutron</i> in man&#39;s relation to man (Lev. 19:20; 25:51;
      Ex. 21:30; Num. 35:31, 32; Isa. 45:13; Prov. 6:35), and in
      the same sense of man&#39;s relation to God (Num. 3:49;
      18:15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many passages in the New Testament which
      represent Christ&#39;s sufferings under the idea of a
      ransom or price, and the result thereby secured is a
      purchase or redemption (comp. Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20;
      Gal. 3:13; 4:4, 5; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 Tim. 2:5, 6;
      Titus 2:14; Heb. 9:12; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19; Rev. 5:9). The idea
      running through all these texts, however various their
      reference, is that of payment made for our redemption. The
      debt against us is not viewed as simply cancelled, but is
      fully paid. Christ&#39;s blood or life, which he
      surrendered for them, is the &quot;ransom&quot; by which
      the deliverance of his people from the servitude of sin and
      from its penal consequences is secured. It is the plain
      doctrine of Scripture that &quot;Christ saves us neither by
      the mere exercise of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by his
      example, nor by the moral influence which he exerted, nor
      by any subjective influence on his people, whether natural
      or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an
      expiation for sin, and as a ransom from the curse and
      authority of the law, thus reconciling us to God by making
      it consistent with his perfection to exercise mercy toward
      sinners&quot; (Hodge&#39;s Systematic Theology).

      <a name="T0003085"><b>Red Sea -</b> The sea so called
      extends along the west coast of Arabia for about 1,400
      miles, and separates Asia from Africa. It is connected with
      the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of
      Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles
      from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms,
      that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr
      el-&#39;Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that
      on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about
      20 broad. This branch is now connected with the
      Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms
      lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is <i>Yam
      Suph</i>. This word <i>suph</i> means a woolly kind of
      sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its
      shores. In these passages, Ex. 10:19; 13:18; 15:4, 22;
      23:31; Num. 14:25, etc., the Hebrew name is always
      translated &quot;Red Sea,&quot; which was the name given to
      it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is
      uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of
      the mountains on the western shore; others from the red
      coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes
      given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In
      the New Testament (Acts 7:36; Heb. 11:29) this name is
      given to the Gulf of Suez.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim,
      i.e., &quot;the Egyptian sea&quot; (Isa. 11:15), and simply
      Ha-yam, &quot;the sea&quot; (Ex. 14:2, 9, 16, 21, 28; Josh.
      24:6, 7; Isa. 10:26, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The great historical event connected with the Red Sea is
      the passage of the children of Israel, and the overthrow of
      the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in
      Scripture (Ex. 14, 15; Num. 33:8; Deut. 11:4; Josh. 2:10;
      Judg. 11:16; 2 Sam. 22:16; Neh. 9:9-11; Ps. 66:6; Isa.
      10:26; Acts 7:36, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003086"><b>Red Sea, Passage of -</b> The account
      of the march of the Israelites through the Red Sea is given
      in Ex. 14:22-31. There has been great diversity of opinion
      as to the precise place where this occurred. The difficulty
      of arriving at any definite conclusion on the matter is
      much increased by the consideration that the head of the
      Gulf of Suez, which was the branch of the sea that was
      crossed, must have extended at the time of the Exodus
      probably 50 miles farther north than it does at present.
      Some have argued that the crossing took place opposite the
      Wady Tawarik, where the sea is at present some 7 miles
      broad. But the opinion that seems to be best supported is
      that which points to the neighbourhood of Suez. This
      position perfectly satisfies all the conditions of the
      stupendous miracle as recorded in the sacred narrative.

      whence the Gr. kanna, a &quot;cane,&quot; a generic name
      for a reed of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reed of Egypt and Palestine is the Arundo donax, which
      grows to the height of 12 feet, its stalk jointed like the
      bamboo, &quot;with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the
      top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly
      flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its
      upright position.&quot; It is used to illustrate weakness
      (2 Kings 18:21; Ezek. 29:6), also fickleness or instability
      (Matt. 11:7; comp. Eph. 4:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      A &quot;bruised reed&quot; (Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20) is an
      emblem of a believer weak in grace. A reed was put into our
      Lord&#39;s hands in derision (Matt. 27:29); and &quot;they
      took the reed and smote him on the head&quot; (30). The
      &quot;reed&quot; on which they put the sponge filled with
      vinegar (Matt. 27:48) was, according to John (19:29), a
      hyssop stalk, which must have been of some length, or
      perhaps a bunch of hyssop twigs fastened to a rod with the
      sponge. (See <a href=

      Matt. 19:28 and Titus 3:5. This word literally means a
      &quot;new birth.&quot; The Greek word so rendered
      (palingenesia) is used by classical writers with reference
      to the changes produced by the return of spring. In Matt.
      19:28 the word is equivalent to the &quot;restitution of
      all things&quot; (Acts 3:21). In Titus 3:5 it denotes that
      change of heart elsewhere spoken of as a passing from death
      to life (1 John 3:14); becoming a new creature in Christ
      Jesus (2 Cor. 5:17); being born again (John 3:5); a renewal
      of the mind (Rom. 12:2); a resurrection from the dead (Eph.
      2:6); a being quickened (2:1, 5).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This change is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. It originates
      not with man but with God (John 1:12, 13; 1 John 2:29; 5:1,
      4).
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the nature of the change, it consists in the
      implanting of a new principle or disposition in the soul;
      the impartation of spiritual life to those who are by
      nature &quot;dead in trespasses and sins.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity of such a change is emphatically affirmed in
      Scripture (John 3:3; Rom. 7:18; 8:7-9; 1 Cor. 2:14; Eph.

      <a name="T0003094"><b>Rehoboam -</b> he enlarges the
      people, the successor of Solomon on the throne, and
      apparently his only son. He was the son of Naamah &quot;the
      Ammonitess,&quot; some well-known Ammonitish princess (1
      Kings 14:21; 2 Chr. 12:13). He was forty-one years old when
      he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years
      (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the
      rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt
      desire to modify the character of the government. The
      burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during
      Solomon&#39;s reign was very oppressive, and therefore the
      people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an
      alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at
      Shechem, and heard their demands for relief (1 Kings 12:4).
      After three days, having consulted with a younger
      generation of courtiers that had grown up around him,
      instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the
      people haughtily (6-15). &quot;The king hearkened not unto
      the people; for the cause was from the Lord&quot; (comp.
      11:31). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The
      terrible cry was heard (comp. 2 Sam. 20:1):</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;What portion have we in David? Neither have we
      inheritance in the son of Jesse: To your tents, O Israel:
      Now see to thine own house, David&quot; (1 Kings 12:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was
      appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18).
      The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam&#39;s own tribe, alone
      remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with
      Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom,
      with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten
      tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing
      Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the
      revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was
      prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24; 2 Chr. 11:1-4)
      from fulfilling his purpose. (See <a href=

      JEROBOAM</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifth year of Rehoboam&#39;s reign, Shishak (q.v.),
      one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred
      up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against
      him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the
      temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of
      a vassal of Egypt (1 Kings 14:25, 26; 2 Chr. 12:5-9). A
      remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at
      Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls
      of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the
      king, Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and
      other figures, with the names of the captured towns of
      Judah, the towns which Rehoboam had fortified (2 Chr.
      11:5-12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The kingdom of Judah, under Rehoboam, sank more and more in
      moral and spiritual decay. &quot;There was war between
      Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.&quot; At length, in
      the fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam &quot;slept with
      his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
      David&quot; (1 Kings 14:31). He was succeeded by his son
      Abijah. (See <a href=
