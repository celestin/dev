      <a name="T0003100"><b>Remaliah -</b> adorned by the Lord,
      the father of Pekah, who conspired successfully against
      Pekahiah (2 Kings 15:25, 27, 30, 32, 37; Isa. 7:1, 4, 5, 9;
      8:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003101"><b>Remeth -</b> another form of Ramah
      (q.v.) or Ramoth (1 Chr. 6:73; Josh. 19:21), and probably
      also of Jarmuth (Josh. 21:29).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003102"><b>Remmon-methoar -</b> (Josh. 19:13),
      rendered correctly in the Revised Version, &quot;Rimmon,
      which stretcheth unto Neah,&quot; a landmark of Zebulun;
      called also Rimmon (1 Chr. 6:77).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003103"><b>Remphan -</b> (Acts 7:43; R.V.,
      &quot;Rephan&quot;). In Amos 5:26 the Heb. Chiun (q.v.) is
      rendered by the LXX. &quot;Rephan,&quot; and this name is
      adopted by Luke in his narrative of the Acts. These names
      represent the star-god Saturn or Moloch.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003104"><b>Rent -</b> (Isa. 3:24), probably a
      rope, as rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate and Revised
      Version, or as some prefer interpreting the phrase,
      &quot;girdle and robe are torn [i.e., are &#39;a rent&#39;]
      by the hand of violence.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003105"><b>Repentance -</b> There are three
      Greek words used in the New Testament to denote repentance.
      (1.) The verb <i>metamelomai</i> is used of a change of
      mind, such as to produce regret or even remorse on account
      of sin, but not necessarily a change of heart. This word is
      used with reference to the repentance of Judas (Matt.
      27:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Metanoeo, meaning to change one&#39;s mind and
      purpose, as the result of after knowledge. This verb, with
      (3) the cognate noun <i>metanoia</i>, is used of true
      repentance, a change of mind and purpose and life, to which
      remission of sin is promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evangelical repentance consists of (1) a true sense of
      one&#39;s own guilt and sinfulness; (2) an apprehension of
      God&#39;s mercy in Christ; (3) an actual hatred of sin (Ps.
      119:128; Job 42:5, 6; 2 Cor. 7:10) and turning from it to
      God; and (4) a persistent endeavour after a holy life in a
      walking with God in the way of his commandments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true penitent is conscious of guilt (Ps. 51:4, 9), of
      pollution (51:5, 7, 10), and of helplessness (51:11;
      109:21, 22). Thus he apprehends himself to be just what God
      has always seen him to be and declares him to be. But
      repentance comprehends not only such a sense of sin, but
      also an apprehension of mercy, without which there can be
      no true repentance (Ps. 51:1; 130:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003106"><b>Rephael -</b> healed of God, one of
      Shemaiah&#39;s sons. He and his brethren, on account of
      their &quot;strength for service,&quot; formed one of the
      divisions of the temple porters (1 Chr. 26:7, 8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003107"><b>Rephaim -</b> lofty men; giants,
      (Gen. 14:5; 2 Sam. 21:16, 18, marg. A.V., Rapha, marg.
      R.V., Raphah; Deut. 3:13, R.V.; A.V., &quot;giants&quot;).
      The aborigines of Palestine, afterwards conquered and
      dispossessed by the Canaanite tribes, are classed under
      this general title. They were known to the Moabites as
      Emim, i.e., &quot;fearful&quot;, (Deut. 2:11), and to the
      Ammonites as Zamzummim. Some of them found refuge among the
      Philistines, and were still existing in the days of David.
      We know nothing of their origin. They were not necessarily
      connected with the &quot;giants&quot; (R.V.,
      &quot;Nephilim&quot;) of Gen. 6:4. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001400.html&amp;from=T0001474&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      GIANTS</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003108"><b>Rephaim, Valley of -</b> (Josh. 15:8;
      18:16, R.V.). When David became king over all Israel, the
      Philistines, judging that he would now become their
      uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon Hebron,
      compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in
      &quot;the hold&quot; at Adullam (2 Sam. 5:17-22), and the
      Philistines took up their position in the valley of
      Rephaim, on the west and south-west of Jerusalem. Thus all
      communication between Bethlehem and Jerusalem was
      intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here,
      there occurred that incident narrated in 2 Sam. 23:15-17.
      Having obtained divine direction, David led his army
      against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over
      them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called
      Baalperazim (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their
      forces in this valley (2 Sam. 5:22). Again warned by a
      divine oracle, David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked
      the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another
      severe defeat, and chasing them with great slaughter to
      Gezer (q.v.). There David kept in check these enemies of
      Israel. This valley is now called el-Bukei&#39;a.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003109"><b>Rephidim -</b> supports, one of the
      stations of the Israelites, situated in the Wady Feiran,
      near its junction with the Wady esh-Sheikh. Here no water
      could be found for the people to drink, and in their
      impatience they were ready to stone Moses, as if he were
      the cause of their distress. At the command of God Moses
      smote &quot;the rock in Horeb,&quot; and a copious stream
      flowed forth, enough for all the people. After this the
      Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here
      encamped, but they were utterly defeated (Ex. 17:1, 8-16).
      They were the &quot;first of the nations&quot; to make war
      against Israel (Num. 24:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites advanced into the
      wilderness of Sinai (Ex. 19:1, 2; Num. 33:14, 15), marching
      probably through the two passes of the Wady Solaf and the
      Wady esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the
      plain er-Rahah, the &quot;desert of Sinai,&quot; which is
      two miles long and about half a mile broad. (See SINAI

      MERIBAH</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003110"><b>Reprobate -</b> that which is
      rejected on account of its own worthlessness (Jer. 6:30;
      Heb. 6:8; Gr. adokimos, &quot;rejected&quot;). This word is
      also used with reference to persons cast away or rejected
      because they have failed to make use of opportunities
      offered them (1 Cor. 9:27; 2 Cor. 13:5-7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003111"><b>Rereward -</b> (Josh. 6:9), the
      troops in the rear of an army on the march, the rear-guard.
      This word is a corruption of the French arriere-garde.
      During the wilderness march the tribe of Dan formed the
      rear-guard (Num. 10:25; comp. 1 Sam. 29:2; Isa. 52:12;
      58:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003112"><b>Resen -</b> head of the stream;
      bridle, one of Nimrod&#39;s cities (Gen. 10:12),
      &quot;between Nineveh and Calah.&quot; It has been supposed
      that the four cities named in this verse were afterwards
      combined into one under the name of Nineveh (q.v.). Resen
      was on the east side of the Tigris. It is probably
      identified with the mound of ruins called Karamless.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003113"><b>Rest -</b> (1.) Gr. katapausis,
      equivalent to the Hebrew word <i>noah</i> (Heb. 4:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Gr. anapausis, &quot;rest from weariness&quot; (Matt.
      11:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Gr. anesis, &quot;relaxation&quot; (2 Thess. 1:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Gr. sabbatismos, a Sabbath rest, a rest from all work
      (Heb. 4:9; R.V., &quot;sabbath&quot;), a rest like that of
      God when he had finished the work of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003114"><b>Resurrection of Christ -</b> one of
      the cardinal facts and doctrines of the gospel. If Christ
      be not risen, our faith is vain (1 Cor. 15:14). The whole
      of the New Testament revelation rests on this as an
      historical fact. On the day of Pentecost Peter argued the
      necessity of Christ&#39;s resurrection from the prediction
      in Ps. 16 (Acts 2:24-28). In his own discourses, also, our
      Lord clearly intimates his resurrection (Matt. 20:19; Mark
      9:9; 14:28; Luke 18:33; John 2:19-22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The evangelists give circumstantial accounts of the facts
      connected with that event, and the apostles, also, in their
      public teaching largely insist upon it. Ten different
      appearances of our risen Lord are recorded in the New
      Testament. They may be arranged as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) To Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre alone. This is
      recorded at length only by John (20:11-18), and alluded to
      by Mark (16:9-11).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) To certain women, &quot;the other Mary,&quot; Salome,
      Joanna, and others, as they returned from the sepulchre.
      Matthew (28:1-10) alone gives an account of this. (Comp.
      Mark 16:1-8, and Luke 24:1-11.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) To Simon Peter alone on the day of the resurrection.
      (See Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) To the two disciples on the way to Emmaus on the day
      of the resurrection, recorded fully only by Luke (24:13-35.
      Comp. Mark 16:12, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) To the ten disciples (Thomas being absent) and others
      &quot;with them,&quot; at Jerusalem on the evening of the
      resurrection day. One of the evangelists gives an account
      of this appearance, John (20:19-24).
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) To the disciples again (Thomas being present) at
      Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:33-40; John 20:26-28. See
      also 1 Cor. 15:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) To the disciples when fishing at the Sea of Galilee.
      Of this appearance also John (21:1-23) alone gives an
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) To the eleven, and above 500 brethren at once, at an
      appointed place in Galilee (1 Cor. 15:6; comp. Matt.
      28:16-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      (9.) To James, but under what circumstances we are not
      informed (1 Cor. 15:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (10.) To the apostles immediately before the ascension.
      They accompanied him from Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and
      there they saw him ascend &quot;till a cloud received him
      out of their sight&quot; (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts
      1:4-10).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of note that it is distinctly related that on
      most of these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples the
      amplest opportunity of testing the fact of his
      resurrection. He conversed with them face to face. They
      touched him (Matt. 28:9; Luke 24:39; John 20:27), and he
      ate bread with them (Luke 24:42, 43; John 21:12, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (11.) In addition to the above, mention might be made of
      Christ&#39;s manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus,
      who speaks of it as an appearance of the risen Saviour
      (Acts 9:3-9, 17; 1 Cor. 15:8; 9:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is implied in the words of Luke (Acts 1:3) that there
      may have been other appearances of which we have no record.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resurrection is spoken of as the act (1) of God the
      Father (Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:24; 3:15; Rom. 8:11; Eph. 1:20;
      Col. 2:12; Heb. 13:20); (2) of Christ himself (John 2:19;
      10:18); and (3) of the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 3:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      The resurrection is a public testimony of Christ&#39;s
      release from his undertaking as surety, and an evidence of
      the Father&#39;s acceptance of his work of redemption. It
      is a victory over death and the grave for all his
      followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of Christ&#39;s resurrection will be seen
      when we consider that if he rose the gospel is true, and if
      he rose not it is false. His resurrection from the dead
      makes it manifest that his sacrifice was accepted. Our
      justification was secured by his obedience to the death,
      and therefore he was raised from the dead (Rom. 4:25). His
      resurrection is a proof that he made a full atonement for
      our sins, that his sacrifice was accepted as a satisfaction
      to divine justice, and his blood a ransom for sinners. It
      is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all
      believers (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 6:14; 15:47-49; Phil. 3:21; 1
      John 3:2). As he lives, they shall live also.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved him to be the Son of God, inasmuch as it
      authenticated all his claims (John 2:19; 10:17). &quot;If
      Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a
      failure, and all the predictions and anticipations of its
      glorious results for time and for eternity, for men and for
      angels of every rank and order, are proved to be chimeras.
      &#39;But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
      first-fruits of them that slept.&#39; Therefore the Bible
      is true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness
      has been overthrown, Satan has fallen as lightning from
      heaven, and the triumph of truth over error, of good over
      evil, of happiness over misery is for ever secured.&quot;
      Hodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers were
      bribed (Matt. 28:12-14) to circulate concerning
      Christ&#39;s resurrection, &quot;his disciples came by
      night and stole him away while we slept,&quot; Matthew
      Henry in his &quot;Commentary,&quot; under John 20:1-10,
      fittingly remarks, &quot;The grave-clothes in which Christ
      had been buried were found in very good order, which serves
      for an evidence that his body was not &#39;stolen away
      while men slept.&#39; Robbers of tombs have been known to
      take away &#39;the clothes&#39; and leave the body; but
      none ever took away &#39;the body&#39; and left the
      clothes, especially when they were &#39;fine linen&#39; and
      new (Mark 15:46). Any one would rather choose to carry a
      dead body in its clothes than naked. Or if they that were
      supposed to have stolen it would have left the
      grave-clothes behind, yet it cannot be supposed they would
      find leisure to &#39;fold up the linen.&#39;&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003115"><b>Resurrection of the dead -</b> will
      be simultaneous both of the just and the unjust (Dan. 12:2;
      John 5:28, 29; Rom. 2:6-16; 2 Thess. 1:6-10). The qualities
      of the resurrection body will be different from those of
      the body laid in the grave (1 Cor. 15:53, 54; Phil. 3:21);
      but its identity will nevertheless be preserved. It will
      still be the same body (1 Cor. 15:42-44) which rises
      again.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will be
      spiritual (1 Cor. 15:44), i.e., a body adapted to the use
      of the soul in its glorified state, and to all the
      conditions of the heavenly state; (2) glorious,
      incorruptible, and powerful (54); (3) like unto the
      glorified body of Christ (Phil. 3:21); and (4) immortal
      (Rev. 21:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ&#39;s resurrection secures and illustrates that of
      his people. &quot;(1.) Because his resurrection seals and
      consummates his redemptive power; and the redemption of our
      persons involves the redemption of our bodies (Rom. 8:23).
      (2.) Because of our federal and vital union with Christ (1
      Cor. 15:21, 22; 1 Thess. 4:14). (3.) Because of his Spirit
      which dwells in us making our bodies his members (1 Cor.
      6:15; Rom. 8:11). (4.) Because Christ by covenant is Lord
      both of the living and the dead (Rom. 14:9). This same

      conduct, referred to in Gen. 35:22, brought down upon him
      his dying father&#39;s malediction (48:4). He showed
      kindness to Joseph, and was the means of saving his life
      when his other brothers would have put him to death
      (37:21,22). It was he also who pledged his life and the
      life of his sons when Jacob was unwilling to let Benjamin
      go down into Egypt. After Jacob and his family went down
      into Egypt (46:8) no further mention is made of Reuben

      upwards (Num. 1:20, 21), and at the close of the wilderness
      wanderings they numbered only 43,730 (26:7). This tribe
      united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in
      the &quot;land of Gilead,&quot; &quot;on the other side of
      Jordan&quot; (32:1-5). The lot assigned to Reuben was the
      smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes. It
      extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of
      the Dead Sea to its northern end, where the Jordan flows
      into it (Josh. 13:15-21, 23). It thus embraced the original
      kingdom of Sihon. Reuben is &quot;to the eastern tribes

      plans, which, under the guidance of his Spirit, has been
      committed to writing. (See WORD OF <a href=

      &quot;record&quot; of revelation; they are the revelation
      itself in a written form, in order to the accurate
      presevation and propagation of the truth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Revelation and inspiration differ. Revelation is the
      supernatural communication of truth to the mind;
      inspiration (q.v.) secures to the teacher or writer
      infallibility in communicating that truth to others. It
      renders its subject the spokesman or prophet of God in such
      a sense that everything he asserts to be true, whether fact
      or doctrine or moral principle, is true, infallibly true.

      <a name="T0003120"><b>Revelation, Book of -</b> =The
      Apocalypse, the closing book and the only prophetical book
      of the New Testament canon. The author of this book was
      undoubtedly John the apostle. His name occurs four times in
      the book itself (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8), and there is every
      reason to conclude that the &quot;John&quot; here mentioned
      was the apostle. In a manuscript of about the twelfth
      century he is called &quot;John the divine,&quot; but no
      reason can be assigned for this appellation.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The date of the writing of this book has generally been
      fixed at A.D. 96, in the reign of Domitian. There are some,
      however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in
      the reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later
      date appeal to the testimony of the Christian father
      Irenaeus, who received information relative to this book
      from those who had seen John face to face. He says that the
      Apocalypse &quot;was seen no long time ago.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the relation between this book and the Gospel of
      John, it has been well observed that &quot;the leading
      ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a
      magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama,
      the supreme conflict between good and evil and its issue.
      In both Jesus Christ is the central figure, whose victory
      through defeat is the issue of the conflict. In both the
      Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the gospel, and
      the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in
      language saturated with the Old Testament. The difference
      of date will go a long way toward explaining the difference
      of style.&quot; Plummer&#39;s Gospel of St. John, Introd.

      and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of
      tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep
      and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and
      children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a
      few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the
      evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly

      David&#39;s reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was sent
      &quot;for Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew
      the Gibeonites.&quot; David inquired of the Gibeonites what
      satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing
      would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but
      the death of seven of Saul&#39;s sons. David accordingly
      delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the
      sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul&#39;s eldest daughter, whom she
      bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung
      up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at Gibeah.
      Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah
      (q.v.), and for five months watched the suspended bodies of
      her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the
      beasts and birds of prey, till they were at length taken
      down and buried by David.

      Her marriage to Abner was the occasion of a quarrel between
      him and Ishbosheth, which led to Abner&#39;s going over to

      21:38; 2 Cor. 11:26). The words of the Authorized Version,
      &quot;counted it not robbery to be equal,&quot; etc. (Phil.
      2:6, 7), are better rendered in the Revised Version,
      &quot;counted it not a prize to be on an equality,&quot;
      etc., i.e., &quot;did not look upon equality with God as a
      prize which must not slip from his grasp&quot; = &quot;did

      <a name="T0003153"><b>Romans, Epistle to the -</b> This
      epistle was probably written at Corinth. Phoebe (Rom. 16:1)
      of Cenchrea conveyed it to Rome, and Gaius of Corinth
      entertained the apostle at the time of his writing it
      (16:23; 1 Cor. 1:14), and Erastus was chamberlain of the
      city, i.e., of Corinth (2 Tim. 4:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned
      in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the
      apostle was about to &quot;go unto Jerusalem to minister
      unto the saints&quot;, i.e., at the close of his second
      visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit
      to that city (Rom. 15:25; comp. Acts 19:21; 20:2, 3, 16; 1
      Cor. 16:1-4), early in A.D. 58.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is highly probable that Christianity was planted in Rome
      by some of those who had been at Jerusalem on the day of
      Pentecost (Acts 2:10). At this time the Jews were very
      numerous in Rome, and their synagogues were probably
      resorted to by Romans also, who in this way became
      acquainted with the great facts regarding Jesus as these
      were reported among the Jews. Thus a church composed of
      both Jews and Gentiles was formed at Rome. Many of the
      brethren went out to meet Paul on his approach to Rome.
      There are evidences that Christians were then in Rome in
      considerable numbers, and had probably more than one place
      of meeting (Rom. 16:14, 15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the apostle in writing to this church was to
      explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel. His
      epistle was a &quot;word in season.&quot; Himself deeply
      impressed with a sense of the value of the doctrines of
      salvation, he opens up in a clear and connected form the
      whole system of the gospel in its relation both to Jew and
      Gentile. This epistle is peculiar in this, that it is a
      systematic exposition of the gospel of universal
      application. The subject is here treated argumentatively,
      and is a plea for Gentiles addressed to Jews. In the
      Epistle to the Galatians, the same subject is discussed,
      but there the apostle pleads his own authority, because the
      church in Galatia had been founded by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the introduction (1:1-15), the apostle presents in it
      divers aspects and relations the doctrine of justification
      by faith (1:16-11:36) on the ground of the imputed
      righteousness of Christ. He shows that salvation is all of
      grace, and only of grace. This main section of his letter
      is followed by various practical exhortations (12:1-15:13),
      which are followed by a conclusion containing personal
      explanations and salutations, which contain the names of
      twenty-four Christians at Rome, a benediction, and a
      doxology (Rom. 15:14-ch. 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003154"><b>Rome -</b> the most celebrated city
      in the world at the time of Christ. It is said to have been
      founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome
      was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and
      contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the
      half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly
      every nation then known. It was distinguished for its
      wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it
      was the capital had then reached its greatest
      prosperity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem
      &quot;strangers from Rome,&quot; who doubtless carried with
      them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were
      instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought
      to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years
      (Acts 28:30, 31) &quot;in his own hired house.&quot; While
      here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the
      Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably
      also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for
      companions Luke and Aristarchus (Acts 27:2), Timothy (Phil.
      1:1; Col. 1:1), Tychicus (Eph. 6: 21), Epaphroditus (Phil.
      4:18), and John Mark (Col. 4:10). (See <a href=

      Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called
      &quot;catacombs,&quot; which were used from about the time
      of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them
      bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as
      places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of
      worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have
      been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting
      insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the
      time of Constantine.

      (found only in these passages), rendered &quot;rose&quot;
      (R.V. marg., &quot;autumn crocus&quot;), is supposed by
      some to mean the oleander, by others the sweet-scented
      narcissus (a native of Palestine), the tulip, or the daisy;
      but nothing definite can be affirmed regarding it.</a>

      The &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; is probably the cistus or
      rock-rose, several species of which abound in Palestine.
      &quot;Mount Carmel especially abounds in the cistus, which
      in April covers some of the barer parts of the mountain

      migrated. There she had a rich relative, Boaz, to whom Ruth
      was eventually married. She became the mother of Obed, the
      grandfather of David. Thus Ruth, a Gentile, is among the
      maternal progenitors of our Lord (Matt. 1:5). The story of

      sabbath was made for man,&quot; as a day of rest and
      refreshment for the body and of blessing to the soul.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is next referred to in connection with the gift of manna
      to the children of Israel in the wilderness (Ex. 16:23);
      and afterwards, when the law was given from Sinai (20:11),
      the people were solemnly charged to &quot;remember the
      sabbath day, to keep it holy.&quot; Thus it is spoken of as
      an institution already existing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Mosaic law strict regulations were laid down
      regarding its observance (Ex. 35:2, 3; Lev. 23:3; 26:34).
      These were peculiar to that dispensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the subsequent history of the Jews frequent references
      are made to the sanctity of the Sabbath (Isa. 56:2, 4, 6,
      7; 58:13, 14; Jer. 17:20-22; Neh. 13:19). In later times
      they perverted the Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord
      rescued it from their perversions, and recalled to them its
      true nature and intent (Matt. 12:10-13; Mark 2:27; Luke
      13:10-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation,
      is of permanent and universal obligation. The physical
      necessities of man require a Sabbath of rest. He is so
      constituted that his bodily welfare needs at least one day
      in seven for rest from ordinary labour. Experience also
      proves that the moral and spiritual necessities of men also
      demand a Sabbath of rest. &quot;I am more and more sure by
      experience that the reason for the observance of the
      Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting necessities of human
      nature, and that as long as man is man the blessedness of
      keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of
      spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly do feel
      by experience the eternal obligation, because of the
      eternal necessity, of the Sabbath. The soul withers without
      it. It thrives in proportion to its observance. The Sabbath
      was made for man. God made it for men in a certain
      spiritual state because they needed it. The need,
      therefore, is deeply hidden in human nature. He who can
      dispense with it must be holy and spiritual indeed. And he
      who, still unholy and unspiritual, would yet dispense with
      it is a man that would fain be wiser than his Maker&quot;
      (F. W. Robertson).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from recently
      recovered inscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the
      royal palace, was based on the division of time into weeks
      of seven days. The Sabbath is in these inscriptions
      designated Sabattu, and defined as &quot;a day of rest for
      the heart&quot; and &quot;a day of completion of
      labour.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh
      day of the week was set apart and consecrated as the
      Sabbath. The first day of the week is now observed as the
      Sabbath. Has God authorized this change? There is an
      obvious distinction between the Sabbath as an institution
      and the particular day set apart for its observance. The
      question, therefore, as to the change of the day in no way
      affects the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as an
      institution. Change of the day or no change, the Sabbath
      remains as a sacred institution the same. It cannot be
      abrogated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any change of the day has been made, it must have been
      by Christ or by his authority. Christ has a right to make
      such a change (Mark 2:23-28). As Creator, Christ was the
      original Lord of the Sabbath (John 1:3; Heb. 1:10). It was
      originally a memorial of creation. A work vastly greater
      than that of creation has now been accomplished by him, the
      work of redemption. We would naturally expect just such a
      change as would make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, we can give no text authorizing the change in so many
      words. We have no express law declaring the change. But
      there are evidences of another kind. We know for a fact
      that the first day of the week has been observed from
      apostolic times, and the necessary conclusion is, that it
      was observed by the apostles and their immediate disciples.
      This, we may be sure, they never would have done without
      the permission or the authority of their Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his resurrection, which took place on the first day
      of the week (Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 20:1),
      we never find Christ meeting with his disciples on the
      seventh day. But he specially honoured the first day by
      manifesting himself to them on four separate occasions
      (Matt. 28:9; Luke 24:34, 18-33; John 20:19-23). Again, on
      the next first day of the week, Jesus appeared to his
      disciples (John 20:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have calculated that Christ&#39;s ascension took place
      on the first day of the week. And there can be no doubt
      that the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that
      day (Acts 2:1). Thus Christ appears as instituting a new
      day to be observed by his people as the Sabbath, a day to
      be henceforth known amongst them as the &quot;Lord&#39;s
      day.&quot; The observance of this &quot;Lord&#39;s
      day&quot; as the Sabbath was the general custom of the
      primitive churches, and must have had apostolic sanction
      (comp. Acts 20:3-7; 1 Cor. 16:1, 2) and authority, and so
      the sanction and authority of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words &quot;at her sabbaths&quot; (Lam. 1:7, A.V.)
      ought probably to be, as in the Revised Version, &quot;at
      her desolations.&quot;

      supposed to be a distance of 2,000 cubits, or less than
      half-a-mile, the distance to which, according to Jewish
      tradition, it was allowable to travel on the Sabbath day
      without violating the law (Acts 1:12; comp. Ex. 16:29; Num.

      that year was not for the owner of the land, but for the
      poor and the stranger and the beasts of the field. All
      debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted
      (Deut. 15:1-11). There is little notice of the observance
      of this year in Biblical history. It appears to have been

      Esther 4:1, 2; Ps. 30:11, etc.), and as a sign of
      repentance (Matt. 11:21). It was put upon animals by the

      <a name="T0003179"><b>Sacrifice -</b> The offering up of
      sacrifices is to be regarded as a divine institution. It
      did not originate with man. God himself appointed it as the
      mode in which acceptable worship was to be offered to him
      by guilty man. The language and the idea of sacrifice
      pervade the whole Bible.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacrifices were offered in the ante-diluvian age. The Lord
      clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of animals, which in
      all probability had been offered in sacrifice (Gen. 3:21).
      Abel offered a sacrifice &quot;of the firstlings of his
      flock&quot; (4:4; Heb. 11:4). A distinction also was made
      between clean and unclean animals, which there is every
      reason to believe had reference to the offering up of
      sacrifices (Gen. 7:2, 8), because animals were not given to
      man as food till after the Flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same practice is continued down through the patriarchal
      age (Gen. 8:20; 12:7; 13:4, 18; 15:9-11; 22:1-18, etc.). In
      the Mosaic period of Old Testament history definite laws
      were prescribed by God regarding the different kinds of
      sacrifices that were to be offered and the manner in which
      the offering was to be made. The offering of stated
      sacrifices became indeed a prominent and distinctive
      feature of the whole period (Ex. 12:3-27; Lev. 23:5-8; Num.
      9:2-14). (See <a href=

      ALTAR</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We learn from the Epistle to the Hebrews that sacrifices
      had in themselves no value or efficacy. They were only the
      &quot;shadow of good things to come,&quot; and pointed the
      worshippers forward to the coming of the great High Priest,
      who, in the fullness of the time, &quot;was offered once
      for all to bear the sin of many.&quot; Sacrifices belonged
      to a temporary economy, to a system of types and emblems
      which served their purposes and have now passed away. The
      &quot;one sacrifice for sins&quot; hath &quot;perfected for
      ever them that are sanctified.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacrifices were of two kinds: 1. Unbloody, such as (1)
      first-fruits and tithes; (2) meat and drink-offerings; and
      (3) incense. 2. Bloody, such as (1) burnt-offerings; (2)
      peace-offerings; and (3) sin and trespass offerings. (See

      <a name="T0003180"><b>Sadducees -</b> The origin of this
      Jewish sect cannot definitely be traced. It was probably
      the outcome of the influence of Grecian customs and
      philosophy during the period of Greek domination. The first
      time they are met with is in connection with John the
      Baptist&#39;s ministry. They came out to him when on the
      banks of the Jordan, and he said to them, &quot;O
      generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the
      wrath to come?&quot; (Matt. 3:7.) The next time they are
      spoken of they are represented as coming to our Lord
      tempting him. He calls them &quot;hypocrites&quot; and
      &quot;a wicked and adulterous generation&quot; (Matt.
      16:1-4; 22:23). The only reference to them in the Gospels
      of Mark (12:18-27) and Luke (20:27-38) is their attempting
      to ridicule the doctrine of the resurrection, which they
      denied, as they also denied the existence of angels. They
      are never mentioned in John&#39;s Gospel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many Sadducees among the &quot;elders&quot; of
      the Sanhedrin. They seem, indeed, to have been as numerous
      as the Pharisees (Acts 23:6). They showed their hatred of
      Jesus in taking part in his condemnation (Matt. 16:21;
      26:1-3, 59; Mark 8:31; 15:1; Luke 9:22; 22:66). They
      endeavoured to prohibit the apostles from preaching the
      resurrection of Christ (Acts 2:24, 31, 32; 4:1, 2; 5:17,
      24-28). They were the deists or sceptics of that age. They
      do not appear as a separate sect after the destruction of
      Jerusalem.

      zafran (i.e., &quot;yellow&quot;), mentioned only in Cant.
      4:13, 14; the Crocus sativus. Many species of the crocus
      are found in Palestine. The pistils and stigmata, from the
      centre of its flowers, are pressed into &quot;saffron
      cakes,&quot; common in the East. &quot;We found,&quot; says
      Tristram, &quot;saffron a very useful condiment in
      travelling cookery, a very small pinch of it giving not
      only a rich yellow colour but an agreable flavour to a dish
      of rice or to an insipid stew.&quot;</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003183"><b>Saint -</b> one separated from the

      covenant; a believer in Christ (Ps. 16:3; Rom. 1:7; 8:27;
      Phil. 1:1; Heb. 6:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;saints&quot; spoken of in Jude 1:14 are probably
      not the disciples of Christ, but the &quot;innumerable
      company of angels&quot; (Heb. 12:22; Ps. 68:17), with
      reference to Deut. 33:2.
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is also used of the holy dead (Matt. 27:52; Rev.
      18:24). It was not used as a distinctive title of the
      apostles and evangelists and of a &quot;spiritual
      nobility&quot; till the fourth century. In that sense it is
      not a scriptural title.

      the son of Neri (Luke 3:27). The probable explanation of
      the apparent discrepancy is that he was the son of Neri,
      the descendant of Nathan, and thus heir to the throne of
      David on the death of Jeconiah (comp. Jer. 22:30).</a>

      33:18, about 7 miles south of AEnon, at the head of the
      great Wady Far&#39;ah, which formed the northern boundary
      of Judea in the Jordan valley.</a>

      a hill covered with dark forests, south of Shechem, from
      which Abimelech and his men gathered wood to burn that city
      (Judg. 9:48). In Ps. 68:14 the change from war to peace is
      likened to snow on the dark mountain, as some interpret the
      expression. Others suppose the words here mean that the
      bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that
      it seemed to be white as if covered with snow. The
      reference, however, of the psalm is probably to Josh. 11
      and 12. The scattering of the kings and their followers is
      fitly likened unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on the
      dark Salmon. It is the modern Jebel Suleiman.</a>

      of Zebedee and mother of James and John (Mat. 27:56), and
      probably the sister of Mary, the mother of our Lord (John
      19:25). She sought for her sons places of honour in
      Christ&#39;s kingdom (Matt. 20:20, 21; comp. 19:28). She
      witnessed the crucifixion (Mark 15:40), and was present

      (2.) &quot;The daughter of Herodias,&quot; not named in the

      in the fortress of Machaerus, she &quot;came in and danced,
      and pleased Herod&quot; (Mark 6:14-29). John the Baptist,
      at that time a prisoner in the dungeons underneath the
      castle, was at her request beheaded by order of Herod, and
      his head given to the damsel in a charger, &quot;and the
      damsel gave it to her mother,&quot; whose revengeful spirit
      was thus gratified. &quot;A luxurious feast of the
      period&quot; (says Farrar, Life of Christ) &quot;was not
      regarded as complete unless it closed with some gross
      pantomimic representation; and doubtless Herod had adopted
      the evil fashion of his day. But he had not anticipated for
      his guests the rare luxury of seeing a princess, his own
      niece, a grand-daughter of Herod the Great and of Mariamne,
      a descendant, therefore, of Simon the high priest and the
      great line of Maccabean princes, a princess who afterwards
      became the wife of a tetrarch [Philip, tetrarch of
      Trachonitis] and the mother of a king, honouring them by

      <a name="T0003196"><b>Salt -</b> used to season food (Job
      6:6), and mixed with the fodder of cattle (Isa. 30:24,
      &quot;clean;&quot; in marg. of R.V. &quot;salted&quot;).
      All meat-offerings were seasoned with salt (Lev. 2:13). To
      eat salt with one is to partake of his hospitality, to
      derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was
      bound to look after his host&#39;s interests (Ezra 4:14,
      &quot;We have maintenance from the king&#39;s palace;&quot;
      A.V. marg., &quot;We are salted with the salt of the
      palace;&quot; R.V., &quot;We eat the salt of the
      palace&quot;).</a>

      A &quot;covenant of salt&quot; (Num. 18:19; 2 Chr. 13:5)
      was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children
      were rubbed with salt (Ezek. 16:4). Disciples are likened
      unto salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving
      uses (Matt. 5:13). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem,
      he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a
      barren soil (Judg. 9:45). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on
      scientific grounds, that under the generic name of
      &quot;salt,&quot; in certain passages, we are to understand
      petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in Gen. 19:26 he
      would read &quot;pillar of asphalt;&quot; and in Matt.
      5:13, instead of &quot;salt,&quot; &quot;petroleum,&quot;
      which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and
      becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made.

      The Jebel Usdum, to the south of the Dead Sea, is a
      mountain of rock salt about 7 miles long and from 2 to 3
      miles wide and some hundreds of feet high.

      <a name="T0003199"><b>Salt, Valley of -</b> a place where
      it is said David smote the Syrians (2 Sam. 8:13). This
      valley (the&#39; Arabah) is between Judah and Edom on the
      south of the Dead Sea. Hence some interpreters would insert
      the words, &quot;and he smote Edom,&quot; after the words,
      &quot;Syrians&quot; in the above text. It is conjectured
      that while David was leading his army against the Ammonites
      and Syrians, the Edomites invaded the south of Judah, and
      that David sent Joab or Abishai against them, who drove
      them back and finally subdued Edom. (Comp. title to Ps.
      60.)</a>
