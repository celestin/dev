      <a name="T0003200"><b>Salutation -</b> &quot;Eastern modes
      of salutation are not unfrequently so prolonged as to
      become wearisome and a positive waste of time. The
      profusely polite Arab asks so many questions after your
      health, your happiness, your welfare, your house, and other
      things, that a person ignorant of the habits of the country
      would imagine there must be some secret ailment or
      mysterious sorrow oppressing you, which you wished to
      conceal, so as to spare the feelings of a dear,
      sympathizing friend, but which he, in the depth of his
      anxiety, would desire to hear of. I have often listened to
      these prolonged salutations in the house, the street, and
      the highway, and not unfrequently I have experienced their
      tedious monotony, and I have bitterly lamented useless
      waste of time&quot; (Porter, Through Samaria, etc.). The
      work on which the disciples were sent forth was one of
      urgency, which left no time for empty compliments and
      prolonged greetings (Luke 10:4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003201"><b>Salvation -</b> This word is used of
      the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians (Ex.
      14:13), and of deliverance generally from evil or danger.
      In the New Testament it is specially used with reference to
      the great deliverance from the guilt and the pollution of
      sin wrought out by Jesus Christ, &quot;the great
      salvation&quot; (Heb. 2:3). (See REDEMPTION &macr;T0003084;

    <p>
      <a name="T0003202"><b>Samaria -</b> a watch-mountain or a
      watch-tower. In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few
      miles north-west of Shechem, stands the &quot;hill of
      Shomeron,&quot; a solitary mountain, a great
      &quot;mamelon.&quot; It is an oblong hill, with steep but
      not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king
      of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for
      two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the
      city to which he gave the name of &quot;Shomeron&quot;,
      i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of
      Tirzah (1 Kings 16:24). As such it possessed many
      advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of
      his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria,
      he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the
      right to &quot;make streets in Samaria&quot;, i.e.,
      probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on
      their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the
      existence of a considerable Syrian population. &quot;It was
      the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign.
      All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal
      tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the
      choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he
      had built the name of its former owner, but its especial
      connection with himself as its founder is proved by the
      designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian
      inscriptions, Beth-khumri (&#39;the house or palace of
      Omri&#39;).&quot;, Stanley.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab,
      Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal
      kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter (1 Kings
      20:1-21). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was
      again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to
      Ahab (20:28-34), whose army, as compared with that of
      Benhadad, was no more than &quot;two little flocks of
      kids.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to
      Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst
      extremities. But just when success seemed to be within
      their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a
      mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army,
      and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind
      them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon
      relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian
      camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha,
      that &quot;a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel,
      and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of
      Samaria&quot; (2 Kings 7:1-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and
      reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C.
      723), which held out for three years, and was at length
      captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser
      had begun (2 Kings 18:9-12; 17:3), and removed vast numbers
      of the tribes into captivity. (See <a href=

      SARGON</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was
      given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who
      rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in
      honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only
      mention of it is in Acts 8:5-14, where it is recorded that
      Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now represented by the hamlet of Sebustieh,
      containing about three hundred inhabitants. The ruins of
      the ancient town are all scattered over the hill, down the
      sides of which they have rolled. The shafts of about one
      hundred of what must have been grand Corinthian columns are
      still standing, and attract much attention, although
      nothing definite is known regarding them. (Comp. Micah
      1:6.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Christ, Western Palestine was divided into
      three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Samaria
      occupied the centre of Palestine (John 4:4). It is called
      in the Talmud the &quot;land of the Cuthim,&quot; and is
      not regarded as a part of the Holy Land at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be noticed that the distance between Samaria and
      Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the two kingdoms, is
      only 35 miles in a direct line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003203"><b>Samaritan Pentateuch -</b> On the
      return from the Exile, the Jews refused the Samaritans
      participation with them in the worship at Jerusalem, and
      the latter separated from all fellowship with them, and
      built a temple for themselves on Mount Gerizim. This temple
      was razed to the ground more than one hundred years B.C.
      Then a system of worship was instituted similar to that of
      the temple at Jerusalem. It was founded on the Law, copies
      of which had been multiplied in Israel as well as in Judah.
      Thus the Pentateuch was preserved among the Samaritans,
      although they never called it by this name, but always
      &quot;the Law,&quot; which they read as one book. The
      division into five books, as we now have it, however, was
      adopted by the Samaritans, as it was by the Jews, in all
      their priests&#39; copies of &quot;the Law,&quot; for the
      sake of convenience. This was the only portion of the Old
      Testament which was accepted by the Samaritans as of divine
      authority.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of the letters in the manuscript copies of the
      Samaritan Pentateuch is different from that of the Hebrew
      copies, and is probably the same as that which was in
      general use before the Captivity. There are other
      peculiarities in the writing which need not here be
      specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are important differences between the Hebrew and the
      Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch in the readings of many
      sentences. In about two thousand instances in which the
      Samaritan and the Jewish texts differ, the LXX. agrees with
      the former. The New Testament also, when quoting from the
      Old Testament, agrees as a rule with the Samaritan text,
      where that differs from the Jewish. Thus Ex. 12:40 in the
      Samaritan reads, &quot;Now the sojourning of the children
      of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the
      land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty
      years&quot; (comp. Gal. 3:17). It may be noted that the
      LXX. has the same reading of this text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003204"><b>Samaritans -</b> the name given to
      the new and mixed inhabitants whom Esarhaddon (B.C. 677),
      the king of Assyria, brought from Babylon and other places
      and settled in the cities of Samaria, instead of the
      original inhabitants whom Sargon (B.C. 721) had removed
      into captivity (2 Kings 17:24; comp. Ezra 4:2, 9, 10).
      These strangers (comp. Luke 17:18) amalgamated with the
      Jews still remaining in the land, and gradually abandoned
      their old idolatry and adopted partly the Jewish
      religion.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the return from the Captivity, the Jews in Jerusalem
      refused to allow them to take part with them in rebuilding
      the temple, and hence sprang up an open enmity between
      them. They erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, which
      was, however, destroyed by a Jewish king (B.C. 130). They
      then built another at Shechem. The bitter enmity between
      the Jews and Samaritans continued in the time of our Lord:
      the Jews had &quot;no dealings with the Samaritans&quot;
      (John 4:9; comp. Luke 9:52, 53). Our Lord was in contempt
      called &quot;a Samaritan&quot; (John 8:48). Many of the
      Samaritans early embraced the gospel (John 4:5-42; Acts
      8:25; 9:31; 15:3). Of these Samaritans there still remains
      a small population of about one hundred and sixty, who all
      reside in Shechem, where they carefully observe the
      religious customs of their fathers. They are the
      &quot;smallest and oldest sect in the world.&quot;

      voyage from Troas to Neapolis (Acts 16:11) on his first
      missionary journey. It is about 8 miles long and 6 miles
      broad. Its modern name is Samothraki.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003208"><b>Samson -</b> of the sun, the son of
      Manoah, born at Zorah. The narrative of his life is given
      in Judg. 13-16. He was a &quot;Nazarite unto God&quot; from
      his birth, the first Nazarite mentioned in Scripture (Judg.
      13:3-5; comp. Num. 6:1-21). The first recorded event of his
      life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath
      (Judg. 14:1-5). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the
      law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the
      seven doomed Canaanite nations (Ex. 34:11-16; Deut. 7:1-4).
      It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage.
      His wife was soon taken from him and given &quot;to his
      companion&quot; (Judg. 14:20). For this Samson took revenge
      by burning the &quot;standing corn of the Philistines&quot;
      (15:1-8), who, in their turn, in revenge &quot;burnt her
      and her father with fire.&quot; Her death he terribly
      avenged (15:7-19). During the twenty years following this
      he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life.
      Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with
      the last twenty years of Eli&#39;s life. After this we have
      an account of his exploits at Gaza (16:1-3), and of his
      infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (16:4-20), and
      then of his melancholy death (16:21-31). He perished in the
      last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies.
      &quot;So the dead which he slew at his death were more [in
      social and political importance=the elite of the people]
      than they which he slew in his life.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Straining all his nerves, he bowed: As with the force
      of winds and waters pent, When mountains tremble, those two
      massy pillars With horrible convulsion to and fro He
      tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew The whole
      roof after them, with burst of thunder Upon the heads of
      all who sat beneath, Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors,
      or priests, Their choice nobility and flower.&quot;
      Milton&#39;s Samson Agonistes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003209"><b>Samuel -</b> heard of God. The
      peculiar circumstances connected with his birth are
      recorded in 1 Sam. 1:20. Hannah, one of the two wives of
      Elkanah, who came up to Shiloh to worship before the Lord,
      earnestly prayed to God that she might become the mother of
      a son. Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the
      child was weaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated
      him to the Lord as a perpetual Nazarite (1:23-2:11). Here
      his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women
      who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his
      religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life
      passed away. &quot;The child Samuel grew on, and was in
      favour both with the Lord, and also with men&quot; (2:26;
      comp. Luke 2:52). It was a time of great and growing
      degeneracy in Israel (Judg. 21:19-21; 1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22).
      The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in
      number and in power, were practically masters of the
      country, and kept the people in subjection (1 Sam. 10:5;
      13:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time new communications from God began to be made
      to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the
      night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli,
      he answered, &quot;Speak, Lord; for thy servant
      heareth.&quot; The message that came from the Lord was one
      of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told
      it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible
      denunciations (1 Sam. 3:11-18) was, &quot;It is the Lord;
      let him do what seemeth him good&quot;, the passive
      submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the
      expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord
      revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his
      fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of
      one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period
      in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning
      under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt,
      and &quot;went out against the Philistines to battle.&quot;
      A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to
      Ebenezer (1 Sam. 4:1, 2). The Israelites were defeated,
      leaving 4,000 dead &quot;in the field.&quot; The chiefs of
      the people thought to repair this great disaster by
      carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of
      Jehovah&#39;s presence. They accordingly, without
      consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp
      near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people
      &quot;shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang
      again.&quot; A second battle was fought, and again the
      Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp,
      slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of
      this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so
      soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken,
      he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the
      sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle
      with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel,
      now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some
      place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many
      years (21:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched
      upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (comp. Jer.
      7:12; Ps. 78:59). This was a great epoch in the history of
      Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek
      the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines.
      During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power
      in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he
      resided, his influence went forth on every side among the
      people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place
      to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people,
      endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness,
      and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far
      successful that &quot;all the house of Israel lamented
      after the Lord.&quot; Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh,
      one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they
      fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his
      direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now
      marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush
      the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel
      God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was
      their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a
      leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They
      fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great
      slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C.
      1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine
      oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in
      token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a
      great stone in the battlefield, and called it
      &quot;Ebenezer,&quot; saying, &quot;Hitherto hath the Lord
      helped us&quot; (1 Sam. 7:1-12). This was the spot where,
      twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great
      defeat, when the ark of God was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long
      period of peace for Israel (1 Sam. 7:13, 14), during which
      Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going &quot;from
      year to year in circuit&quot; from his home in Ramah to
      Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley,
      but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and
      returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular
      services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah
      he gathered a company of young men around him and
      established a school of the prophets. The schools of the
      prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also
      at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an
      important influence on the national character and history
      of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of
      growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish
      commonwealth.

    <p>
      Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the
      functions of his judicial office, being the friend and
      counsellor of the people in all matters of private and
      public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a
      reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the
      &quot;seer,&quot; the prophet of the Lord. At the close of
      this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of
      Israel came to him at Ramah (1 Sam. 8:4, 5, 19-22); and
      feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was
      exposed from the misconduct of Samuel&#39;s sons, whom he
      had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and
      had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also
      from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded
      that a king should be set over them. This request was very
      displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and
      warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length,
      however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their
      desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king (11:15).
      Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of
      the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed
      them with reference to his own relation to them as judge
      and prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah,
      only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing
      again in public (1 Sam. 13, 15) with communications from
      God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which
      now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch.16)
      to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as
      king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is
      known of him till the time of his death, which took place
      at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age.
      &quot;And all Israel gathered themselves together, and
      lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah&quot;
      (25:1), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden
      of his house. (Comp. 2 Kings 21:18; 2 Chr. 33:20; 1 Kings
      2:34; John 19:41.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel&#39;s devotion to God, and the special favour with
      which God regarded him, are referred to in Jer. 15:1 and
      Ps. 99:6.

      <a name="T0003210"><b>Samuel, Books of -</b> The LXX.
      translators regarded the books of Samuel and of Kings as
      forming one continuous history, which they divided into
      four books, which they called &quot;Books of the
      Kingdom.&quot; The Vulgate version followed this division,
      but styled them &quot;Books of the Kings.&quot; These books
      of Samuel they accordingly called the &quot;First&quot; and
      &quot;Second&quot; Books of Kings, and not, as in the
      modern Protestant versions, the &quot;First&quot; and
      &quot;Second&quot; Books of Samuel.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The authors of the books of Samuel were probably Samuel,
      Gad, and Nathan. Samuel penned the first twenty-four
      chapters of the first book. Gad, the companion of David (1
      Sam. 22:5), continued the history thus commenced; and
      Nathan completed it, probably arranging the whole in the
      form in which we now have it (1 Chr. 29:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the books. The first book comprises a
      period of about a hundred years, and nearly coincides with
      the life of Samuel. It contains (1) the history of Eli
      (1-4); (2) the history of Samuel (5-12); (3) the history of
      Saul, and of David in exile (13-31). The second book,
      comprising a period of perhaps fifty years, contains a
      history of the reign of David (1) over Judah (1-4), and (2)
      over all Israel (5-24), mainly in its political aspects.
      The last four chapters of Second Samuel may be regarded as
      a sort of appendix recording various events, but not
      chronologically. These books do not contain complete
      histories. Frequent gaps are met with in the record,
      because their object is to present a history of the kingdom
      of God in its gradual development, and not of the events of
      the reigns of the successive rulers. It is noticeable that
      the section (2 Sam. 11:2-12: 29) containing an account of
      David&#39;s sin in the matter of Bathsheba is omitted in
      the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.

      <a name="T0003211"><b>Sanballat -</b> held some place of
      authority in Samaria when Nehemiah went up to Jerusalem to
      rebuild its ruined walls. He vainly attempted to hinder
      this work (Neh. 2:10, 19; 4:1-12; 6). His daughter became
      the wife of one of the sons of Joiada, a son of the high
      priest, much to the grief of Nehemiah (13:28).</a>

      <a name="T0003212"><b>Sanctification -</b> involves more
      than a mere moral reformation of character, brought about
      by the power of the truth: it is the work of the Holy
      Spirit bringing the whole nature more and more under the
      influences of the new gracious principles implanted in the
      soul in regeneration. In other words, sanctification is the
      carrying on to perfection the work begun in regeneration,
      and it extends to the whole man (Rom. 6:13; 2 Cor. 4:6;
      Col. 3:10; 1 John 4:7; 1 Cor. 6:19). It is the special
      office of the Holy Spirit in the plan of redemption to
      carry on this work (1 Cor. 6:11; 2 Thess. 2:13). Faith is
      instrumental in securing sanctification, inasmuch as it (1)
      secures union to Christ (Gal. 2:20), and (2) brings the
      believer into living contact with the truth, whereby he is
      led to yield obedience &quot;to the commands, trembling at
      the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for
      this life and that which is to come.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect sanctification is not attainable in this life (1
      Kings 8:46; Prov. 20:9; Eccl. 7:20; James 3:2; 1 John 1:8).
      See Paul&#39;s account of himself in Rom. 7:14-25; Phil.
      3:12-14; and 1 Tim. 1:15; also the confessions of David
      (Ps. 19:12, 13; 51), of Moses (90:8), of Job (42:5, 6), and
      of Daniel (9:3-20). &quot;The more holy a man is, the more
      humble, self-renouncing, self-abhorring, and the more
      sensitive to every sin he becomes, and the more closely he
      clings to Christ. The moral imperfections which cling to
      him he feels to be sins, which he laments and strives to
      overcome. Believers find that their life is a constant
      warfare, and they need to take the kingdom of heaven by
      storm, and watch while they pray. They are always subject
      to the constant chastisement of their Father&#39;s loving
      hand, which can only be designed to correct their
      imperfections and to confirm their graces. And it has been
      notoriously the fact that the best Christians have been
      those who have been the least prone to claim the attainment
      of perfection for themselves.&quot;, Hodge&#39;s Outlines.

      12:4; 21:12); (4) the holy place, the place of the Presence
      (Gr. hieron, the temple-house; not the <i>naos</i>, which
      is the temple area, with its courts and porches), Lev. 4:6;
      Eph. 2:21, R.V., marg.; (5) God&#39;s holy habitation in
      heaven (Ps. 102:19). In the final state there is properly
      &quot;no sanctuary&quot; (Rev. 21:22), for God and the Lamb
      &quot;are the sanctuary&quot; (R.V., &quot;temple&quot;).

      <a name="T0003215"><b>Sanhedrim -</b> more correctly
      Sanhedrin (Gr. synedrion), meaning &quot;a sitting
      together,&quot; or a &quot;council.&quot; This word
      (rendered &quot;council,&quot; A.V.) is frequently used in
      the New Testament (Matt. 5:22; 26:59; Mark 15:1, etc.) to
      denote the supreme judicial and administrative council of
      the Jews, which, it is said, was first instituted by Moses,
      and was composed of seventy men (Num. 11:16, 17). But that
      seems to have been only a temporary arrangement which Moses
      made. This council is with greater probability supposed to
      have originated among the Jews when they were under the
      domination of the Syrian kings in the time of the
      Maccabees. The name is first employed by the Jewish
      historian Josephus. This &quot;council&quot; is referred to
      simply as the &quot;chief priests and elders of the
      people&quot; (Matt. 26:3, 47, 57, 59; 27:1, 3, 12, 20,
      etc.), before whom Christ was tried on the charge of
      claiming to be the Messiah. Peter and John were also
      brought before it for promulgating heresy (Acts. 4:1-23;
      5:17-41); as was also Stephen on a charge of blasphemy
      (6:12-15), and Paul for violating a temple by-law (22:30;
      23:1-10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanhedrin is said to have consisted of seventy-one
      members, the high priest being president. They were of
      three classes (1) the chief priests, or heads of the
      twenty-four priestly courses (1 Chr. 24), (2) the scribes,
      and (3) the elders. As the highest court of judicature,
      &quot;in all causes and over all persons, ecclesiastical
      and civil, supreme,&quot; its decrees were binding, not
      only on the Jews in Palestine, but on all Jews wherever
      scattered abroad. Its jurisdiction was greatly curtailed by
      Herod, and afterwards by the Romans. Its usual place of
      meeting was within the precincts of the temple, in the hall
      &quot;Gazith,&quot; but it sometimes met also in the house
      of the high priest (Matt. 26:3), who was assisted by two
      vice-presidents.

      generals established himself on the vacant throne, taking
      the name of &quot;Sargon,&quot; after that of the famous
      monarch, the Sargon of Accad, founder of the first Semitic
      empire, as well as of one of the most famous libraries of
      Chaldea. He forthwith began a conquering career, and became
      one of the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs. He is

      At the very beginning of his reign he besieged and took the

      says, &quot;The city of Samaria I besieged, I took; 27,280
      of its inhabitants I carried away; fifty chariots that were
      among them I collected,&quot; etc. The northern kingdom he
      changed into an Assyrian satrapy. He afterwards drove
      Merodach-baladan (q.v.), who kept him at bay for twelve
      years, out of Babylon, which he entered in triumph. By a
      succession of victories he gradually enlarged and
      consolidated the empire, which now extended from the
      frontiers of Egypt in the west to the mountains of Elam in
      the east, and thus carried almost to completion the
      ambitious designs of Tiglath-pileser (q.v.). He was
      murdered by one of his own soldiers (B.C. 705) in his
      palace at Khorsabad, after a reign of sixteen years, and
      was succeeded by his son Sennacherib.

      Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty

      He is also called &quot;the dragon,&quot; &quot;the old

      world&quot; (2 Cor. 4:4); &quot;the spirit that now worketh
      in the children of disobedience&quot; (Eph. 2:2). The
      distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men
      are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the
      wilderness (Matt. 4:1-11). He is &quot;Beelzebub, the
      prince of the devils&quot; (12:24). He is &quot;the
      constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of
      the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of
      falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil
      in every possible way.&quot; His power is very great in the
      world. He is a &quot;roaring lion, seeking whom he may
      devour&quot; (1 Pet. 5:8). Men are said to be &quot;taken
      captive by him&quot; (2 Tim. 2:26). Christians are warned
      against his &quot;devices&quot; (2 Cor. 2:11), and called
      on to &quot;resist&quot; him (James 4:7). Christ redeems
      his people from &quot;him that had the power of death, that
      is, the devil&quot; (Heb. 2:14). Satan has the &quot;power

      north-east they came to &quot;the land of Shalisha,&quot;
      and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length
      came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel&#39;s home at
      Ramah (9:5-10). At this point Saul proposed to return from
      the three days&#39; fruitless search, but his servant
      suggested that they should first consult the
      &quot;seer.&quot; Hearing that he was about to offer
      sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and &quot;behold,
      Samuel came out against them,&quot; on his way to the
      &quot;bamah&quot;, i.e., the &quot;height&quot;, where
      sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul&#39;s
      question, &quot;Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer&#39;s
      house is,&quot; Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel
      had been divinely prepared for his coming (9:15-17), and
      received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the
      sacrifice, and then after the feast &quot;communed with
      Saul upon the top of the house&quot; of all that was in his
      heart. On the morrow Samuel &quot;took a vial of oil and
      poured it on his head,&quot; and anointed Saul as king over
      Israel (9:25-10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation
      of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in
      Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit
      of God came upon him, and &quot;he was turned into another
      man.&quot; The simple countryman was transformed into the
      king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in
      his whole demeanour, and the people said in their
      astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish,
      &quot;Is Saul also among the prophets?&quot;, a saying
      which passed into a &quot;proverb.&quot; (Comp. 19:24.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown
      to the people. The &quot;anointing&quot; had been in
      secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must
      be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the
      people to a solemn assembly &quot;before the Lord&quot; at
      Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (10:17-27), and it fell upon
      Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest
      man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in
      Israel by the loud cry, &quot;God save the king!&quot; He
      now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of
      bodyguard, &quot;a band of men whose hearts God had
      touched.&quot; On reaching his home he dismissed them, and
      resumed the quiet toils of his former life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the
      Ammonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the
      tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the
      trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army
      to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite
      invaders at Jabesh (11:1-11). Amid the universal joy
      occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as
      the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel &quot;all
      the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king
      before the Lord in Gilgal.&quot; Samuel now officially
      anointed him as king (11:15). Although Samuel never ceased
      to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity
      practically came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of
      freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the
      Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army
      of 3,000 men (1 Sam. 13:1, 2). The Philistines were
      encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash
      and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men,
      occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly
      without any direction from his father &quot;smote&quot; the
      Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who
      gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and
      &quot;people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in
      multitude,&quot; encamped in Michmash, which Saul had
      evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in
      Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed
      (10:8); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it
      was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering
      the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the
      fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had
      not waited long enough (13:13, 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      When Saul, after Samuel&#39;s departure, went out from
      Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to
      that number (13:15), against the Philistines at Michmash
      (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegrante tree at
      Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone
      intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested,
      uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with
      his armour-bearer planned an assault against the
      Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army (14:1-15).
      Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and
      on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow
      rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the
      Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the
      Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the
      Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great
      terror. &quot;It was a very great trembling;&quot; a
      supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a
      band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the
      confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the
      tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway
      between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally
      routed. &quot;So the Lord saved Israel that day.&quot;
      While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the
      people, saying, &quot;Cursed be the man that eateth any
      food until evening.&quot; But though faint and weary, the
      Israelites &quot;smote the Philistines that day from
      Michmash to Aijalon&quot; (a distance of from 15 to 20
      miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in
      pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the
      honeycomb which was abundant there (14:27). This was
      afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42), and he threatened
      to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed,
      saying, &quot;There shall not one hair of his head fall to
      the ground.&quot; He whom God had so signally owned, who
      had &quot;wrought this great salvation in Israel,&quot;
      must not die. &quot;Then Saul went up from following the
      Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own
      place&quot; (1 Sam. 14:24-46); and thus the campaign
      against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul&#39;s
      second great military success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul&#39;s reign, however, continued to be one of almost
      constant war against his enemies round about (14:47, 48),
      in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the
      Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length (1
      Sam. 15). These oldest and hereditary (Ex. 17:8; Num.
      14:43-45) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the
      south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to
      execute the &quot;ban&quot; which God had pronounced (Deut.
      25:17-19) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The
      cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was
      &quot;the test of his moral qualification for being
      king.&quot; Saul proceeded to execute the divine command;
      and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim (1
      Sam. 15:4) against the Amalekites, whom he smote &quot;from
      Havilah until thou comest to Shur,&quot; utterly destroying
      &quot;all the people with the edge of the sword&quot;,
      i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty
      of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king,
      and in conniving at his soldiers&#39; sparing the best of
      the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal,
      in the Jordan valley, said unto him, &quot;Because thou
      hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected
      thee from being king&quot; (15:23). The kingdom was rent
      from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the
      Lord chose to be Saul&#39;s successor, and whom Samuel
      anointed (16:1-13). From that day &quot;the spirit of the
      Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord
      troubled him.&quot; He and Samuel parted only to meet once
      again at one of the schools of the prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      David was now sent for as a &quot;cunning player on an
      harp&quot; (1 Sam. 16:16, 18), to play before Saul when the
      evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the
      court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king.
      At length David returned to his father&#39;s house and to
      his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three
      years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and
      gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in
      Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah.
      Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and
      encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay
      between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath
      of Gath, the champion of the Philistines (17:4-54), an
      exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the
      Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his
      service (18:2); but he became jealous of him (ver. 9), and
      on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (ver. 10,
      11), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at
      different times he tried in vain to carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time the Philistines &quot;gathered themselves
      together&quot; in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their
      camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul
      &quot;gathered all Israel together,&quot; and &quot;pitched
      in Gilboa&quot; (1 Sam. 28:3-14). Being unable to discover
      the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his
      retinue, betook himself to the &quot;witch of Endor,&quot;
      some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the
      startling communication that was mysteriously made to him
      by Samuel (ver. 16-19), who appeared to him. &quot;He fell
      straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid,
      because of the words of Samuel&quot; (ver. 20). The
      Philistine host &quot;fought against Israel: and the men of
      Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
      Mount Gilboa&quot; (31:1). In his despair at the disaster
      that had befallen his army, Saul &quot;took a sword and
      fell upon it.&quot; And the Philistines on the morrow
      &quot;found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount
      Gilboa.&quot; Having cut off his head, they sent it with
      his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the
      temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless
      body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan.
      The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from
      this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the
      bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however,
      afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah (2 Sam.
      21:13, 14). (See <a href=

      form or degree of evil. In its highest sense the word
      indicates the relation sustained by our Lord to his
      redeemed ones, he is their Saviour. The great message of
      the gospel is about salvation and the Saviour. It is the
      &quot;gospel of salvation.&quot; Faith in the Lord Jesus
      Christ secures to the sinner a personal interest in the
      work of redemption. Salvation is redemption made effectual
      to the individual by the power of the Holy Spirit.</a>

      <a name="T0003232"><b>Scapegoat -</b> Lev. 16:8-26; R.V.,
      &quot;the goat for Azazel&quot; (q.v.), the name given to
      the goat which was taken away into the wilderness on the
      day of Atonement (16:20-22). The priest made atonement over
      the scapegoat, laying Israel&#39;s guilt upon it, and then
      sent it away, the goat bearing &quot;upon him all their
      iniquities unto a land not inhabited.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later period an evasion or modification of the law of
      Moses was introduced by the Jews. &quot;The goat was
      conducted to a mountain named Tzuk, situated at a distance
      of ten Sabbath days&#39; journey, or about six and a half
      English miles, from Jerusalem. At this place the Judean
      desert was supposed to commence; and the man in whose
      charge the goat was sent out, while setting him free, was
      instructed to push the unhappy beast down the slope of the
      mountain side, which was so steep as to insure the death of
      the goat, whose bones were broken by the fall. The reason
      of this barbarous custom was that on one occasion the
      scapegoat returned to Jerusalem after being set free, which
      was considered such an evil omen that its recurrence was
      prevented for the future by the death of the goat&quot;
      (Twenty-one Years&#39; Work in the Holy Land). This
      mountain is now called el-Muntar.

      by the Egyptians from the shell-fish Carthamus tinctorius;
      and by the Hebrews from the Coccus ilicis, an insect which
      infests oak trees, called kermes by the Arabians.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This colour was early known (Gen. 38:28). It was one of the
      colours of the ephod (Ex. 28:6), the girdle (8), and the
      breastplate (15) of the high priest. It is also mentioned
      in various other connections (Josh. 2:18; 2 Sam. 1:24; Lam.
      4:5; Nahum 2:3). A scarlet robe was in mockery placed on
      our Lord (Matt. 27:28; Luke 23:11). &quot;Sins as
      scarlet&quot; (Isa. 1:18), i.e., as scarlet robes
      &quot;glaring and habitual.&quot; Scarlet and crimson were
      the firmest of dyes, and thus not easily washed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003234"><b>Sceptre -</b> (Heb. shebet = Gr.
      skeptron), properly a staff or rod. As a symbol of
      authority, the use of the sceptre originated in the idea
      that the ruler was as a shepherd of his people (Gen. 49:10;
      Num. 24:17; Ps. 45:6; Isa. 14:5). There is no example on
      record of a sceptre having ever been actually handled by a
      Jewish king.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003235"><b>Sceva -</b> an implement, a Jew,
      chief of the priests at Ephesus (Acts 19:13-16); i.e., the
      head of one of the twenty-four courses of the house of
      Levi. He had seven sons, who &quot;took upon them to call
      over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord
      Jesus,&quot; in imitation of Paul. They tried their method
      of exorcism on a fierce demoniac, and failed. His answer to
      them was to this effect (19:15): &quot;The Jesus whom you
      invoke is One whose authority I acknowledge; and the Paul
      whom you name I recognize to be a servant or messenger of
      God; but what sort of men are ye who have been empowered to
      act as you do by neither?&quot; (Lindsay on the Acts of the

      <a name="T0003237"><b>Schoolmaster -</b> the law so
      designated by Paul (Gal. 3:24, 25). As so used, the word
      does not mean teacher, but pedagogue (shortened into the
      modern page), i.e., one who was intrusted with the
      supervision of a family, taking them to and from the
      school, being responsible for their safety and manners.
      Hence the pedagogue was stern and severe in his discipline.
      Thus the law was a pedagogue to the Jews, with a view to
      Christ, i.e., to prepare for faith in Christ by producing
      convictions of guilt and helplessness. The office of the
      pedagogue ceased when &quot;faith came&quot;, i.e., the
      object of that faith, the seed, which is Christ.</a>

      called the Porcian law, no Roman citizen could be scourged
      in any case (Acts 16:22-37). (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0003241"><b>Scribes -</b> anciently held various
      important offices in the public affairs of the nation. The
      Hebrew word so rendered (sopher) is first used to designate
      the holder of some military office (Judg. 5:14; A.V.,
      &quot;pen of the writer;&quot; R.V., &quot;the
      marshal&#39;s staff;&quot; marg., &quot;the staff of the
      scribe&quot;). The scribes acted as secretaries of state,
      whose business it was to prepare and issue decrees in the
      name of the king (2 Sam. 8:17; 20:25; 1 Chr. 18:16; 24:6; 1
      Kings 4:3; 2 Kings 12:9-11; 18:18-37, etc.). They
      discharged various other important public duties as men of
      high authority and influence in the affairs of state.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also a subordinate class of scribes, most of whom
      were Levites. They were engaged in various ways as writers.
      Such, for example, was Baruch, who &quot;wrote from the
      mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord&quot; (Jer.
      36:4, 32).
    </p>
    <p>
      In later times, after the Captivity, when the nation lost
      its independence, the scribes turned their attention to the
      law, gaining for themselves distinction by their intimate
      acquaintance with its contents. On them devolved the duty
      of multiplying copies of the law and of teaching it to
      others (Ezra 7:6, 10-12; Neh. 8:1, 4, 9, 13). It is evident
      that in New Testament times the scribes belonged to the
      sect of the Pharisees, who supplemented the ancient written
      law by their traditions (Matt. 23), thereby obscuring it
      and rendering it of none effect. The titles
      &quot;scribes&quot; and &quot;lawyers&quot; (q.v.) are in
      the Gospels interchangeable (Matt. 22:35; Mark 12:28; Luke
      20:39, etc.). They were in the time of our Lord the public
      teachers of the people, and frequently came into collision
      with him. They afterwards showed themselves greatly hostile
      to the apostles (Acts 4:5; 6:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the scribes, however, were men of a different
      spirit, and showed themselves friendly to the gospel and
      its preachers. Thus Gamaliel advised the Sanhedrin, when
      the apostles were before them charged with &quot;teaching
      in this name,&quot; to &quot;refrain from these men and let
      them alone&quot; (Acts 5:34-39; comp. 23:9).

      usually fastened to the girdle (1 Sam. 17:40); &quot;a
      shepherd&#39;s bag.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament it is the rendering of Gr. pera, which
      was a bag carried by travellers and shepherds, generally
      made of skin (Matt. 10:10; Mark 6:8; Luke 9:3; 10:4). The
      name &quot;scrip&quot; is meant to denote that the bag was
      intended to hold scraps, fragments, as if scraped off from
      larger articles, trifles.

      <a name="T0003243"><b>Scripture -</b> invariably in the New
      Testament denotes that definite collection of sacred books,
      regarded as given by inspiration of God, which we usually
      call the Old Testament (2 Tim. 3:15, 16; John 20:9; Gal.
      3:22; 2 Pet. 1:20). It was God&#39;s purpose thus to
      perpetuate his revealed will. From time to time he raised
      up men to commit to writing in an infallible record the
      revelation he gave. The &quot;Scripture,&quot; or
      collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time
      to time as God saw necessary. We have now a completed
      &quot;Scripture,&quot; consisting of the Old and New
      Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our Lord
      was precisely the same as that which we now possess under
      that name. He placed the seal of his own authority on this
      collection of writings, as all equally given by inspiration
      (Matt. 5:17; 7:12; 22:40; Luke 16:29, 31). (See BIBLE

      far away toward the east. Of this vast country but little
      was anciently known. Its modern representative is Russia,
      which, to a great extent, includes the same
      territories.&quot; They were the descendants of Japheth
      (Gen. 9:27). It appears that in apostolic times there were

      <a name="T0003246"><b>Seal -</b> commonly a ring engraved
      with some device (Gen. 38:18, 25). Jezebel &quot;wrote
      letters in Ahab&#39;s name, and sealed them with his
      seal&quot; (1 Kings 21:8). Seals are frequently mentioned
      in Jewish history (Deut. 32:34; Neh. 9:38; 10:1; Esther
      3:12; Cant. 8:6; Isa. 8:16; Jer. 22:24; 32:44, etc.).
      Sealing a document was equivalent to the signature of the
      owner of the seal. &quot;The use of a signet-ring by the
      monarch has recently received a remarkable illustration by
      the discovery of an impression of such a signet on fine
      clay at Koyunjik, the site of the ancient Nineveh. This
      seal appears to have been impressed from the bezel of a
      metallic finger-ring. It is an oval, 2 inches in length by
      1 inch wide, and bears the image, name, and titles of the
      Egyptian king Sabaco&quot; (Rawlinson&#39;s Hist. Illus. of
      the O.T., p. 46). The actual signet-rings of two Egyptian

      The use of seals is mentioned in the New Testament only in
      connection with the record of our Lord&#39;s burial (Matt.
      27:66). The tomb was sealed by the Pharisees and chief
      priests for the purpose of making sure that the disciples
      would not come and steal the body away (ver. 63, 64). The
      mode of doing this was probably by stretching a cord across
      the stone and sealing it at both ends with sealing-clay.
      When God is said to have sealed the Redeemer, the meaning
      is, that he has attested his divine mission (John 6:27).
      Circumcision is a seal, an attestation of the covenant
      (Rom. 4:11). Believers are sealed with the Spirit, as
      God&#39;s mark put upon them (Eph. 1:13; 4:30). Converts
      are by Paul styled the seal of his apostleship, i.e., they
      are its attestation (1 Cor. 9:2). Seals and sealing are
      frequently mentioned in the book of Revelation (5:1; 6:1;
      7:3; 10:4; 22:10).

      &quot;Like the Persian Xerxes, he was weak and
      vainglorious, cowardly under reverse, and cruel and
      boastful in success.&quot; He first set himself to break up
      the powerful combination of princes who were in league
      against him. Among these was Hezekiah, who had entered into
      an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. He accordingly led
      a very powerful army of at least 200,000 men into Judea,
      and devastated the land on every side, taking and
      destroying many cities (2 Kings 18:13-16; comp. Isa. 22,
      24, 29, and 2 Chr. 32:1-8). His own account of this
      invasion, as given in the Assyrian annals, is in these
      words: &quot;Because Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not
      submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of
      arms and by the might of my power I took forty-six of his
      strong fenced cities; and of the smaller towns which were
      scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number.
      From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons,
      old and young, male and female, together with horses and
      mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless
      multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his
      capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round
      the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against
      the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah
      there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent
      out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30
      talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers
      treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were
      brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government.&quot;
      (Comp. Isa. 22:1-13 for description of the feelings of the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian feudatory.
      He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt (2 Kings
      18:20-24). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second
      time into Palestine (2 Kings 18:17, 37; 19; 2 Chr. 32:9-23;

      invasions from the east). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to
      persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. (See <a href=

      TIRHAKAH</a>.) He next sent a threatening letter (2 Kings
      19:10-14), which Hezekiah carried into the temple and
      spread before the Lord. Isaiah again brought an encouraging
      message to the pious king (2 Kings 19:20-34). &quot;In that
      night&quot; the angel of the Lord went forth and smote the
      camp of the Assyrians. In the morning, &quot;behold, they
      were all dead corpses.&quot; The Assyrian army was
      annihilated.

    <p>
      This great disaster is not, as was to be expected, taken
      notice of in the Assyrian annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Sennacherib survived this disaster some twenty
      years, he never again renewed his attempt against
      Jerusalem. He was murdered by two of his own sons
      (Adrammelech and Sharezer), and was succeeded by another
      son, Esarhaddon (B.C. 681), after a reign of twenty-four
      years.

      and Leah were burried (79:29-32). In Acts 7:16 it is said
      that Jacob was &quot;laid in the sepulchre that Abraham
      bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father
      of Sychem.&quot; It has been proposed, as a mode of
      reconciling the apparent discrepancy between this verse and
      Gen. 23:20, to read Acts 7:16 thus: &quot;And they [i.e.,
      our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the

      Jeremiah took advantage of the occasion, and sent with
      Seraiah a word of cheer to the exiles in Babylon, and an
      announcement of the doom in store for that guilty city. The
      roll containing this message (Jer. 50:1-8) Seraiah was to
      read to the exiles, and then, after fixing a stone to it,
      was to throw it into the Euphrates, uttering, as it sank,
      the prayer recorded in Jer. 51:59-64. Babylon was at this
      time in the height of its glory, the greatest and most

      The serpent is first mentioned in connection with the
      history of the temptation and fall of our first parents
      (Gen. 3). It has been well remarked regarding this
      temptation: &quot;A real serpent was the agent of the
      temptation, as is plain from what is said of the natural
      characteristic of the serpent in the first verse of the
      chapter (3:1), and from the curse pronounced upon the
      animal itself. But that Satan was the actual tempter, and
      that he used the serpent merely as his instrument, is
      evident (1) from the nature of the transaction; for
      although the serpent may be the most subtle of all the
      beasts of the field, yet he has not the high intellectual
      faculties which the tempter here displayed. (2.) In the New
      Testament it is both directly asserted and in various forms
      assumed that Satan seduced our first parents into sin (John
      8:44; Rom. 16:20; 2 Cor. 11:3, 14; Rev. 12:9; 20:2).&quot;

      encampment at Ezion-gaber, the Israelites entered on a wide
      sandy desert, which stretches from the mountains of Edom as
      far as the Persian Gulf. While traversing this region, the
      people began to murmur and utter loud complaints against
      Moses. As a punishment, the Lord sent serpents among them,
      and much people of Israel died. Moses interceded on their
      behalf, and by divine direction he made a &quot;brazen
      serpent,&quot; and raised it on a pole in the midst of the
      camp, and all the wounded Israelites who looked on it were
      at once healed. (Comp. John 3:14, 15.) (See <a href=
