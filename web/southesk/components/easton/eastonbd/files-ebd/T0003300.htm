      <a name="T0003301"><b>Shadrach -</b> Aku&#39;s command, the
      Chaldean name given to Hananiah, one of the Hebrew youths
      whom Nebuchadnezzar carried captive to Babylon (Dan. 1:6,
      7; 3:12-30). He and his two companions refused to bow down
      before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up on the
      plains of Dura. Their conduct filled the king with the
      greatest fury, and he commanded them to be cast into the
      burning fiery furnace. Here, amid the fiery flames, they
      were miraculously preserved from harm. Over them the fire
      had no power, &quot;neither was a hair of their head
      singed, neither had the smell of fire passed on them.&quot;
      Thus Nebuchadnezzar learned the greatness of the God of
      Israel. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0003302"><b>Shalem -</b> perfect, a place
      (probably the village of Salim) some 2 miles east of
      Jacob&#39;s well. There is an abundant supply of water,
      which may have been the reason for Jacob&#39;s settling at
      this place (Gen. 33:18-20). The Revised Version translates
      this word, and reads, &quot;Jacob came in peace to the city
      of Shechem,&quot; thus not regarding it as a proper name at
      all.</a>

      <a name="T0003303"><b>Shalim, Land of -</b> land of foxes,
      a place apparently to the north-west of Jerusalem (1 Sam.
      9:4), perhaps in the neighbourhood of Shaalabbin in Dan
      (Josh. 19:42).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003304"><b>Shalisha, Land of -</b> probably the
      district of Baal-shalisha (2 Kings 4:42), lying about 12

    <p>
      <a name="T0003305"><b>Shallecheth, The gate of -</b> i.e.,
      &quot;the gate of casting out,&quot; hence supposed to be
      the refuse gate; one of the gates of the house of the Lord,
      &quot;by the causeway of the going up&quot; i.e., the
      causeway rising up from the Tyropoeon valley = valley of
      the cheesemakers (1 Chr. 26:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003306"><b>Shallum -</b> retribution. (1.) The
      son of Jabesh, otherwise unknown. He &quot;conspired
      against Zachariah, and smote him before the people, and
      slew him, and reigned in his stead&quot; (2 Kings 15:10).
      He reigned only &quot;a month of days in Samaria&quot;
      (15:13, marg.). Menahem rose up against Shallum and put him
      to death (2 Kings 15:14, 15, 17), and became king in his
      stead.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Keeper of the temple vestments in the reign of Josiah
      (2 Kings 22:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) One of the posterity of Judah (1 Chr. 2:40, 41).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) A descendant of Simeon (1 Chr. 4:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) One of the line of the high priests (1 Chr. 6:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) 1 Chr. 7:13.
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) A keeper of the gate in the reign of David (1 Chr.
      9:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) A Levite porter (1 Chr. 9:19, 31; Jer. 35:4).

    <p>
      (10.) The uncle of the prophet Jeremiah (Jer. 32:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (11.) A son of king Josiah (1 Chr. 3:15; Jer. 22:11), who
      was elected to succeed his father on the throne, although
      he was two years younger than his brother Eliakim. He
      assumed the crown under the name of Jehoahaz (q.v.). He did
      not imitate the example of his father (2 Kings 23:32), but
      was &quot;a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey;
      it devoured men&quot; (Ezek. 19:3). His policy was
      anti-Egyptian therefore. Necho, at that time at Riblah,
      sent an army against Jerusalem, which at once yielded, and
      Jehoahaz was carried captive to the Egyptian camp, Eliakim
      being appointed king in his stead. He remained a captive in
      Egypt till his death, and was the first king of Judah that
      died in exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003307"><b>Shalman -</b> an Assyrian king (Hos.
      10:14), identified with Shalmaneser II. (Sayce) or IV.
      (Lenormant), the successor of Pul on the throne of Assyria
      (B.C. 728). He made war against Hoshea, the king of Israel,
      whom he subdued and compelled to pay an annual tribute.
      Hoshea, however, soon after rebelled against his Assyrian
      conquerer. Shalmaneser again marched against Samaria,
      which, after a siege of three years, was taken (2 Kings
      17:3-5; 18:9) by Sargon (q.v.). A revolution meantime had
      broken out in Assyria, and Shalmaneser was deposed. Sargon
      usurped the vacant throne. Schrader thinks that this is
      probably the name of a king of Moab mentioned on an
      inscription of Tiglath-pileser as Salamanu.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003308"><b>Shamgar -</b> The Philistines from
      the maritime plain had made incursions into the Hebrew
      upland for the purposes of plunder, when one of this name,
      the son of Anath, otherwise unknown, headed a rising for
      the purpose of freeing the land from this oppression. He
      repelled the invasion, slaying 600 men with an &quot;ox
      goad&quot; (q.v.). The goad was a formidable sharpointed
      instrument, sometimes ten feet long. He was probably
      contemporary for a time with Deborah and Barak (Judg. 3:31;
      5:6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003309"><b>Shamir -</b> a sharp thorn. (1.) One

    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The residence of Tola, one of the judges, on Mount
      Ephraim (Judg. 10:1, 2).

      also Shammoth (1 Chr. 11:27) and Shamhuth (27:8).

      represented the tribe of Reuben.</a>
    </p>

      (2.) One of David&#39;s sons (1 Chr. 14:4; 3:5,
      &quot;Shimea;&quot; 2 Sam. 5:14).

      (3.) A Levite under Nehemiah (11:17).

    <p>
      <a name="T0003312"><b>Shaphan -</b> a coney, a scribe or
      secretary of king Josiah (2 Kings 22:3-7). He consulted
      Huldah concerning the newly-discovered copy of the law

      Tell Zakariya and Kefr Zakariya, in the valley of Elah, 3
      1/2 miles north-west of Socoh.</a>

      R.V., &quot;the shearing-house of the shepherds;&quot;
      marg., &quot;house of gathering&quot;), some place between
      Samaria and Jezreel, where Jehu slew &quot;two and forty

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003323"><b>Shear-Jashub -</b> a remnant shall
      escape or return (i.e., to God), a symbolical name which
      the prophet Isaiah gave to his son (Isa. 7:3), perhaps his
      eldest son.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003324"><b>Sheba -</b> an oath, seven. (1.) Heb.
      shebha, the son of Raamah (Gen. 10:7), whose descendants
      settled with those of Dedan on the Persian Gulf.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. id. A son of Joktan (Gen. 10:28), probably the

    </p>

      Keturah (Gen. 25:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. id. A kingdom in Arabia Felix. Sheba, in fact,
      was Saba in Southern Arabia, the Sabaeans of classical
      geography, who carried on the trade in spices with the
      other peoples of the ancient world. They were Semites,
      speaking one of the two main dialects of Himyaritic or
      South Arabic. Sheba had become a monarchy before the days
      of Solomon. Its queen brought him gold, spices, and
      precious stones (1 Kings 10:1-13). She is called by our
      Lord the &quot;queen of the south&quot; (Matt. 12:42).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Heb. shebha&#39;, &quot;seven&quot; or &quot;an
      oak.&quot; A town of Simeon (Josh. 19:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) Heb. id. A &quot;son of Bichri,&quot; of the family of
      Becher, the son of Benjamin, and thus of the stem from
      which Saul was descended (2 Sam. 20:1-22). When David was
      returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, a
      strife arose between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah,
      because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king.
      Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised
      the standard of revolt, proclaiming, &quot;We have no part
      in David.&quot; With his followers he proceeded northward.
      David seeing it necessary to check this revolt, ordered
      Abishai to take the gibborim, &quot;mighty men,&quot; and
      the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and
      pursue Sheba. Joab joined the expedition, and having
      treacherously put Amasa to death, assumed the command of
      the army. Sheba took refuge in Abel-Bethmaachah, a
      fortified town some miles north of Lake Merom. While Joab
      was engaged in laying siege to this city, Sheba&#39;s head
      was, at the instigation of a &quot;wise woman&quot; who had
      held a parley with him from the city walls, thrown over the
      wall to the besiegers, and thus the revolt came to an end.

      Eliakim was promoted to it (Isa. 22:15-25). He appears to
      have been the leader of the party who favoured an alliance
      with Egypt against Assyria. It is conjectured that
      &quot;Shebna the scribe,&quot; who was one of those whom

      (3.) A city in Samaria (Gen. 33:18), called also Sichem
      (12:6), Sychem (Acts 7:16). It stood in the narrow
      sheltered valley between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on
      the south, these mountains at their base being only some
      500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his tent and built
      his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the
      first divine promise (Gen. 12:6, 7). Here also Jacob
      &quot;bought a parcel of a field at the hands of the
      children of Hamor&quot; after his return from Mesopotamia,
      and settled with his household, which he purged from
      idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an
      oak tree, which was afterwards called &quot;the oak of the
      sorcerer&quot; (Gen. 33:19; 35:4; Judg. 9:37). (See <a

      MEONENIM</a>.) Here too, after a while, he dug a well,
      which bears his name to this day (John 4:5, 39-42). To
      Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel &quot;before God,&quot;
      and delivered to them his second parting address (Josh.
      24:1-15). He &quot;made a covenant with the people that
      day&quot; at the very place where, on first entering the
      land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim
      (Josh. 24:25), the terms of which were recorded &quot;in
      the book of the law of God&quot;, i.e., in the roll of the
      law of Moses; and in memory of this solemn transaction a
      great stone was set up &quot;under an oak&quot; (comp. Gen.
      28:18; 31:44-48; Ex. 24:4; Josh. 4:3, 8, 9), possibly the
      old &quot;oak of Moreh,&quot; as a silent witness of the
      transaction to all coming time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shechem became one of the cities of refuge, the central
      city of refuge for Western Palestine (Josh. 20:7), and here
      the bones of Joseph were buried (24:32). Rehoboam was
      appointed king in Shechem (1 Kings 12:1, 19), but Jeroboam
      afterwards took up his residence here. This city is
      mentioned in connection with our Lord&#39;s conversation
      with the woman of Samaria (John 4:5); and thus, remaining
      as it does to the present day, it is one of the oldest
      cities of the world. It is the modern Nablus, a contraction
      for Neapolis, the name given to it by Vespasian. It lies
      about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern
      slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100
      feet above it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It
      contains about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 160 are
      Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest being Christians and
      Mohammedans.

    <p>
      The site of Shechem is said to be of unrivalled beauty.
      Stanley says it is &quot;the most beautiful, perhaps the
      only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine.&quot;

      Gaza, near Shechem, only mentioned 1 Chr. 7:28, has
      entirely disappeared. It was destroyed at the time of the
      Conquest, and its place was taken by Shechem. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0003331"><b>Shechinah -</b> a Chaldee word
      meaning resting-place, not found in Scripture, but used by
      the later Jews to designate the visible symbol of God&#39;s
      presence in the tabernacle, and afterwards in Solomon&#39;s
      temple. When the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, he went
      before them &quot;in a pillar of a cloud.&quot; This was
      the symbol of his presence with his people. For references
      made to it during the wilderness wanderings, see Ex. 14:20;
      40:34-38; Lev. 9:23, 24; Num. 14:10; 16:19, 42.</a>

    <p>
      It is probable that after the entrance into Canaan this
      glory-cloud settled in the tabernacle upon the ark of the
      covenant in the most holy place. We have, however, no
      special reference to it till the consecration of the temple
      by Solomon, when it filled the whole house with its glory,
      so that the priests could not stand to minister (1 Kings
      8:10-13; 2 Chr. 5:13, 14; 7:1-3). Probably it remained in
      the first temple in the holy of holies as the symbol of
      Jehovah&#39;s presence so long as that temple stood. It
      afterwards disappeared. (See <a href=

      <a name="T0003332"><b>Sheep -</b> are of different
      varieties. Probably the flocks of Abraham and Isaac were of
      the wild species found still in the mountain regions of
      Persia and Kurdistan. After the Exodus, and as a result of
      intercourse with surrounding nations, other species were no
      doubt introduced into the herds of the people of Israel.
      They are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The care of a
      shepherd over his flock is referred to as illustrating
      God&#39;s care over his people (Ps. 23:1, 2; 74:1; 77:20;
      Isa. 40:11; 53:6; John 10:1-5, 7-16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The sheep of Palestine are longer in the head than
      ours, and have tails from 5 inches broad at the narrowest
      part to 15 inches at the widest, the weight being in
      proportion, and ranging generally from 10 to 14 lbs., but
      sometimes extending to 30 lbs. The tails are indeed huge
      masses of fat&quot; (Geikie&#39;s Holy Land, etc.). The
      tail was no doubt the &quot;rump&quot; so frequently
      referred to in the Levitical sacrifices (Ex. 29:22; Lev.
      3:9; 7:3; 9:19). Sheep-shearing was generally an occasion
      of great festivity (Gen. 31:19; 38:12, 13; 1 Sam. 25:4-8,
      36; 2 Sam. 13:23-28).

      enclosure for the protection of the sheep gathered within
      it (Num. 32:24; 1 Chr. 17:7; Ps. 50:9; 78:70). In John
      10:16 the Authorized Version renders by &quot;fold&quot;
      two distinct Greek words, aule and poimne, the latter of
      which properly means a &quot;flock,&quot; and is so
      rendered in the Revised Version. (See also Matt. 26:31;
      Luke 2:8; 1 Cor. 9:7.) (See <a href=

      <a name="T0003335"><b>Sheep-market -</b> occurs only in
      John 5:2 (marg., also R.V., &quot;sheep-gate&quot;). The

      whether the noun to be supplied should be &quot;gate&quot;

      <a name="T0003336"><b>Shekel -</b> weight, the common
      standard both of weight and value among the Hebrews. It is
      estimated at 220 English grains, or a little more than half
      an ounce avoirdupois. The &quot;shekel of the
      sanctuary&quot; (Ex. 30:13; Num. 3:47) was equal to twenty
      gerahs (Ezek. 45:12). There were shekels of gold (1 Chr.
      21:25), of silver (1 Sam. 9:8), of brass (17:5), and of
      iron (7). When it became a coined piece of money, the
      shekel of gold was equivalent to about 2 pound of our
      money. Six gold shekels, according to the later Jewish
      system, were equal in value to fifty silver ones.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The temple contribution, with which the public sacrifices
      were bought (Ex. 30:13; 2 Chr. 24:6), consisted of one
      common shekel, or a sanctuary half-shekel, equal to two
      Attic drachmas. The coin, a stater (q.v.), which Peter
      found in the fish&#39;s mouth paid this contribution for
      both him and Christ (Matt. 17:24, 27). A zuza, or quarter
      of a shekel, was given by Saul to Samuel (1 Sam. 9:8).

      12:10; 17:16). This word is used figuratively to represent
      the relation of rulers to their subjects and of God to his
      people (Ps. 23:1; 80:1; Isa. 40:11; 44:28; Jer. 25:34, 35;

      The duties of a shepherd in an unenclosed country like
      Palestine were very onerous. &quot;In early morning he led
      forth the flock from the fold, marching at its head to the
      spot where they were to be pastured. Here he watched them
      all day, taking care that none of the sheep strayed, and if
      any for a time eluded his watch and wandered away from the
      rest, seeking diligently till he found and brought it back.
      In those lands sheep require to be supplied regularly with
      water, and the shepherd for this purpose has to guide them
      either to some running stream or to wells dug in the
      wilderness and furnished with troughs. At night he brought
      the flock home to the fold, counting them as they passed
      under the rod at the door to assure himself that none were
      missing. Nor did his labours always end with sunset. Often
      he had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the
      attack of wild beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling
      thief (see 1 Sam. 17:34).&quot;, Deane&#39;s David.

      to be equivalent to Babel (Babylon), according to a secret
      (cabalistic) mode of writing among the Jews of unknown
      antiquity, which consisted in substituting the last letter
      of the Hebrew alphabet for the first, the last but one for
      the second, and so on. Thus the letters sh, sh, ch become
      b, b, l, i.e., Babel. This is supposed to be confirmed by a
      reference to Jer. 51:41, where Sheshach and Babylon are in
      parallel clauses. There seems to be no reason to doubt that
      Babylon is here intended by this name. (See Streane&#39;s

      This bread consisted of twelve loaves made of the finest

      of six each on a table in the holy place before the Lord.
      They were renewed every Sabbath (Lev. 24:5-9), and those
      that were removed to give place to the new ones were to be
      eaten by the priests only in the holy place (see 1 Sam.
      21:3-6; comp. Matt. 12:3, 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of the loaves represented the twelve tribes of
      Israel, and also the entire spiritual Israel, &quot;the
      true Israel;&quot; and the placing of them on the table
      symbolized the entire consecration of Israel to the Lord,
      and their acceptance of God as their God. The table for the
      bread was made of acacia wood, 3 feet long, 18 inches
      broad, and 2 feet 3 inches high. It was plated with pure
      gold. Two staves, plated with gold, passed through golden
      rings, were used for carrying it.

      from mixing largely with the Moabites, Ishmaelites, and

      tried to escape by the &quot;passages of the Jordan,&quot;
      the Gileadites seized the fords and would allow none to
      pass who could not pronounce &quot;shibboleth&quot; with a
      strong aspirate. This the fugitives were unable to do. They
      said &quot;sibboleth,&quot; as the word was pronounced by
      the tribes on the west, and thus they were detected (Judg.

    <p>
      Shields were usually &quot;anointed&quot; (Isa. 21:5), in
