      The word so rendered (A.V.) in Deut. 33:25, <i>
      min&#39;al</i>, &quot;a bar,&quot; is derived from a root
      meaning &quot;to bolt&quot; or &quot;shut fast,&quot; and
      hence a fastness or fortress. The verse has accordingly
      been rendered &quot;iron and brass shall be thy

      Shaalabbin (Josh. 19:42).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003413"><b>Shuhite -</b> a designation of Bildad

      &quot;Shunem:&quot; otherwise, the import of the word is
      uncertain (Cant. 6:13; R.V., &quot;Shulammite&quot;).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003415"><b>Shunammite -</b> a person of Shunem
      (1 Kings 1:3; 2 Kings 4:12). The Syr. and Arab. read
      &quot;Sulamite.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003416"><b>Shunem -</b> two resting-places, a
      little village in the tribe of Issachar, to the north of
      Jezreel and south of Mount Gilboa (Josh. 19:18), where the
      Philistines encamped when they came against Saul (1 Sam.
      28:4), and where Elisha was hospitably entertained by a
      rich woman of the place. On the sudden death of this
      woman&#39;s son she hastened to Carmel, 20 miles distant
      across the plain, to tell Elisha, and to bring him with her
      to Shunem. There, in the &quot;prophet&#39;s chamber,&quot;
      the dead child lay; and Elisha entering it, shut the door
      and prayed earnestly: and the boy was restored to life (2
      Kings 4:8-37). This woman afterwards retired during the
      famine to the low land of the Philistines; and on returning
      a few years afterwards, found her house and fields in the
      possession of a stranger. She appealed to the king at
      Samaria, and had them in a somewhat remarkable manner
      restored to her (comp. 2 Kings 8:1-6).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003417"><b>Shur -</b> an enclosure; a wall, a
      part, probably, of the Arabian desert, on the north-eastern
      border of Egypt, giving its name to a wilderness extending
      from Egypt toward Philistia (Gen. 16:7; 20:1; 25:18;
      Ex.15:22). The name was probably given to it from the wall
      (or shur) which the Egyptians built to defend their
      frontier on the north-east from the desert tribes. This
      wall or line of fortifications extended from Pelusium to
      Heliopolis.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003418"><b>Shushan -</b> a lily, the Susa of
      Greek and Roman writers, once the capital of Elam. It lay
      in the uplands of Susiana, on the east of the Tigris, about
      150 miles to the north of the head of the Persian Gulf. It
      is the modern Shush, on the northwest of Shuster. Once a
      magnificent city, it is now an immense mass of ruins. Here
      Daniel saw one of his visions (Dan. 8); and here also
      Nehemiah (Neh. 1) began his public life. Most of the events
      recorded in the Book of Esther took place here. Modern
      explorers have brought to light numerous relics, and the
      ground-plan of the splendid palace of Shushan, one of the
      residences of the great king, together with numerous
      specimens of ancient art, which illustrate the statements
      of Scripture regarding it (Dan. 8:2). The great hall of
      this palace (Esther 1) &quot;consisted of several
      magnificent groups of columns, together with a frontage of
      343 feet 9 inches, and a depth of 244 feet. These groups
      were arranged into a central phalanx of thirty-six columns
      (six rows of six each), flanked on the west, north, and
      east by an equal number, disposed in double rows of six
      each, and distant from them 64 feet 2 inches.&quot; The
      inscriptions on the ruins represent that the palace was
      founded by Darius and completed by Artaxerxes.</a>

      of David&#39;s heroes (1 Chr. 11:29), general of the eighth
      division of the army (27:11). He slew the giant Saph in the
      battle of Gob (2 Sam. 21:18; R.V., &quot;Sibbechai&quot;).
      Called also Mebunnai (23:27).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003421"><b>Sibmah -</b> coolness; fragrance, a
      town in Reuben, in the territory of Moab, on the east of
      Jordan (Josh. 13:19); called also Shebam and Shibmah (Num.
      32:3, 38). It was famous for its vines (Isa. 16:9; Jer.
      48:32). It has been identified with the ruin of Sumieh,
      where there are rock-cut wine-presses. This fact explains
      the words of the prophets referred to above. It was about 5
      miles east of Heshbon.</a>

      resembled that in modern use. The ears of corn were cut
      with it near the top of the straw. There was also a sickle
      used for warlike purposes, more correctly, however, called
      a pruning-hook (Deut. 16:9; Jer. 50:16, marg.,
      &quot;scythe;&quot; Joel 3:13; Mark 4:29).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003424"><b>Siddim, Vale of -</b> valley of the
      broad plains, &quot;which is the salt sea&quot; (Gen. 14:3,
      8, 10), between Engedi and the cities of the plain, at the
      south end of the Dead Sea. It was &quot;full of
      slime-pits&quot; (R.V., &quot;bitumen pits&quot;). Here
      Chedorlaomer and the confederate kings overthrew the kings
      of Sodom and the cities of the plain. God afterwards, on
      account of their wickedness, &quot;overthrew those cities,
      and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the
      cities;&quot; and the smoke of their destruction &quot;went
      up as the smoke of a furnace&quot; (19:24-28), and was
      visible from Mamre, where Abraham dwelt.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some, however, contend that the &quot;cities of the
      plain&quot; were somewhere at the north of the Dead Sea.

      <a name="T0003426"><b>Signet -</b> a seal used to attest
      documents (Dan. 6:8-10, 12). In 6:17, this word properly
      denotes a ring. The impression of a signet ring on fine
      clay has recently been discovered among the ruins at
      Nineveh. It bears the name and title of an Egyptian king.
      Two actual signet rings of ancient Egyptian monarchs
      (Cheops and Horus) have also been discovered.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When digging a shaft close to the south wall of the temple
      area, the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, at a
      depth of 12 feet below the surface, came upon a pavement of
      polished stones, formerly one of the streets of the city.
      Under this pavement they found a stratum of 16 feet of
      concrete, and among this concrete, 10 feet down, they found
      a signet stone bearing the inscription, in Old Hebrew
      characters, &quot;Haggai, son of Shebaniah.&quot; It has
      been asked, Might not this be the actual seal of Haggai the
      prophet? We know that he was in Jerusalem after the
      Captivity; and it is somewhat singular that he alone of all
      the minor prophets makes mention of a signet (Hag. 2:23).

      <a name="T0003427"><b>Sihon -</b> striking down. The whole
      country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the
      Jabbok, was possessed by the Amorites, whose king, Sihon,
      refused to permit the Israelites to pass through his
      territory, and put his army in array against them. The
      Israelites went forth against him to battle, and gained a
      complete victory. The Amorites were defeated; Sihon, his
      sons, and all his people were smitten with the sword, his
      walled towns were captured, and the entire country of the
      Amorites was taken possession of by the Israelites (Num.
      21:21-30; Deut. 2:24-37).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The country from the Jabbok to Hermon was at this time
      ruled by Og, the last of the Rephaim. He also tried to
      prevent the progress of the Israelites, but was utterly
      routed, and all his cities and territory fell into the
      hands of the Israelites (comp. Num. 21:33-35; Deut. 3:1-14;
      Ps. 135: 10-12; 136:17-22).
    </p>
    <p>
      These two victories gave the Israelites possession of the
      country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the foot
      of Hermon. The kingdom of Sihon embraced about 1,500 square
      miles, while that of Og was more than 3,000 square miles.

      black; dark the name given to the river Nile in Isa. 23:3;
      Jer. 2:18. In Josh. 13:3 it is probably &quot;the river of
      Egypt&quot;, i.e., the Wady el-Arish (1 Chr. 13:5), which
      flows &quot;before Egypt&quot;, i.e., in a north-easterly
      direction from Egypt, and enters the sea about 50 miles
      south-west of Gaza.</a>

      of the church at Jerusalem; also called Silvanus. He and
      Judas, surnamed Barsabas, were chosen by the church there
      to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their return to Antioch
      from the council of the apostles and elders (Acts 15:22),
      as bearers of the decree adopted by the council. He
      assisted Paul there in his evangelistic labours, and was
      also chosen by him to be his companion on his second
      missionary tour (Acts 16:19-24). He is referred to in the
      epistles under the name of Silvanus (2 Cor. 1:19; 1 Thess.
      1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1; 1 Pet. 5:12). There is no record of the

      Heb. meshi, (Ezek. 16:10, 13, rendered &quot;silk&quot;).
      In Gen. 41:42 (marg. A.V.), Prov. 31:22 (R.V., &quot;fine

      The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a
      subterranean channel springs from the &quot;Fountain of the

      several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance
      is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from
      north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes

      an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about
      19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew
      record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered
      by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the
      manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole
      length is said to be &quot;twelve hundred cubits;&quot; and
      the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the
      excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both
      ends, meeting in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time
      of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the
      reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in
      1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller
      dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this
      tunnel that Isaiah (8:6) probably refers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Siloam inscription above referred to was
      surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and
      broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by
      the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have
      been restored to their original place.

      <a name="T0003434"><b>Siloam, Tower of -</b> mentioned only
      Luke 13:4. The place here spoken of is the village now
      called Silwan, or Kefr Silwan, on the east of the valley of
      Kidron, and to the north-east of the pool. It stands on the
      west slope of the Mount of Olives.</a>

      As illustrative of the movement of small bands of
      Canaanites from place to place, and the intermingling of
      Canaanites and Israelites even in small towns in earlier
      times, M.C. Ganneau records the following curious fact:
      &quot;Among the inhabitants of the village (of Siloam)
      there are a hundred or so domiciled for the most part in
      the lower quarter, and forming a group apart from the rest,
      called Dhiabrye, i.e., men of Dhiban. It appears that at
      some remote period a colony from the capital of king Mesha
      (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed itself at the
      gates of Jerusalem at Silwan. The memory of this migration
      is still preserved; and I am assured by the people
      themselves that many of their number are installed in other
      villages round Jerusalem&quot; (quoted by Henderson,
      Palestine).

      of purposes, as may be judged from the frequent references
      to it in Scripture. It first appears in commerce in Gen.
      13:2; 23:15, 16. It was largely employed for making vessels
      for the sanctuary in the wilderness (Ex. 26:19; 27:17; Num.
      7:13, 19; 10:2). There is no record of its having been
      found in Syria or Palestine. It was brought in large
      quantities by foreign merchants from abroad, from Spain and
      India and other countries probably.</a>

      Levi in the terrible act of vengeance against Hamor and the
      Shechemites (34:25, 26). He was detained by Joseph in Egypt
      as a hostage (42:24). His father, when dying, pronounced a
      malediction against him (49:5-7). The words in the
      Authorized Version (49:6), &quot;they digged down a

      his dark complexion, a teacher of some distinction in the
      church of Antioch (Acts 13:1-3). It has been supposed that
      this was the Simon of Cyrene who bore Christ&#39;s cross.

      the other tribes. They decreased in the wilderness by about
      two-thirds (comp. Num. 1:23; 26:14). Moses pronounces no
      blessing on this tribe. It is passed by in silence (Deut.
      33).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This tribe received as their portion a part of the
      territory already allotted to Judah (Josh. 19:1-9). It lay
      in the south-west of the land, with Judah on the east and
      Dan on the north; but whether it was a compact territory or
      not cannot be determined. The subsequent notices of this
      tribe are but few (1 Chr. 4:24-43). Like Reuben on the east
      of Jordan, this tribe had little influence on the history
      of Israel.

      Simeon. (1.) One of the twelve apostles, called the
      Canaanite (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18). This word
      &quot;Canaanite&quot; does not mean a native of Canaan, but
      is derived from the Syriac word Kanean or Kaneniah, which
      was the name of a Jewish sect. The Revised Version has
      &quot;Cananaean;&quot; marg., &quot;or Zealot&quot; He is
      also called &quot;Zelotes&quot; (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13;
      R.V., &quot;the Zealot&quot;), because previous to his call

    <p>
      (6.) A Jew of Cyrene, in North Africa, then a province of
      Libya. A hundred thousand Jews from Palestine had been
      settled in this province by Ptolemy Soter (B.C. 323-285),
      where by this time they had greatly increased in number.
      They had a synagogue in Jerusalem for such of their number
      as went thither to the annual feasts. Simon was seized by
      the soldiers as the procession wended its way to the place
      of crucifixion as he was passing by, and the heavy cross
      which Christ from failing strength could no longer bear was
      laid on his shoulders. Perhaps they seized him because he
      showed sympathy with Jesus. He was the &quot;father of
      Alexander and Rufus&quot; (Matt. 27:32). Possibly this
      Simon may have been one of the &quot;men of Cyrene&quot;
      who preached the word to the Greeks (Acts 11:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) A sorcerer of great repute for his magical arts among
      the Samaritans (Acts 8:9-11). He afterwards became a
      professed convert to the faith under the preaching of
      Philip the deacon and evangelist (12, 13). His profession
      was, however, soon found to be hollow. His conduct called
      forth from Peter a stern rebuke (8:18-23). From this moment
      he disappears from the Church&#39;s history. The term
      &quot;Simony,&quot; as denoting the purchase for money of
      spiritual offices, is derived from him.

      <a name="T0003441"><b>Sin -</b> is &quot;any want of
      conformity unto or transgression of the law of God&quot; (1
      John 3:4; Rom. 4:15), in the inward state and habit of the
      soul, as well as in the outward conduct of the life,
      whether by omission or commission (Rom. 6:12-17; 7:5-24).
      It is &quot;not a mere violation of the law of our
      constitution, nor of the system of things, but an offence
      against a personal lawgiver and moral governor who
      vindicates his law with penalties. The soul that sins is
      always conscious that his sin is (1) intrinsically vile and
      polluting, and (2) that it justly deserves punishment, and
      calls down the righteous wrath of God. Hence sin carries
      with it two inalienable characters, (1) ill-desert, guilt
      (reatus); and (2) pollution (macula).&quot;, Hodge&#39;s
      Outlines.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral character of a man&#39;s actions is determined by
      the moral state of his heart. The disposition to sin, or
      the habit of the soul that leads to the sinful act, is
      itself also sin (Rom. 6:12-17; Gal. 5:17; James 1:14, 15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of sin is a mystery, and must for ever remain
      such to us. It is plain that for some reason God has
      permitted sin to enter this world, and that is all we know.
      His permitting it, however, in no way makes God the author
      of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam&#39;s sin (Gen. 3:1-6) consisted in his yielding to
      the assaults of temptation and eating the forbidden fruit.
      It involved in it, (1) the sin of unbelief, virtually
      making God a liar; and (2) the guilt of disobedience to a
      positive command. By this sin he became an apostate from
      God, a rebel in arms against his Creator. He lost the
      favour of God and communion with him; his whole nature
      became depraved, and he incurred the penalty involved in
      the covenant of works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Original sin. &quot;Our first parents being the root of all
      mankind, the guilt of their sin was imputed, and the same
      death in sin and corrupted nature were conveyed to all
      their posterity, descending from them by ordinary
      generation.&quot; Adam was constituted by God the federal
      head and representative of all his posterity, as he was
      also their natural head, and therefore when he fell they
      fell with him (Rom. 5:12-21; 1 Cor. 15:22-45). His
      probation was their probation, and his fall their fall.
      Because of Adam&#39;s first sin all his posterity came into
      the world in a state of sin and condemnation, i.e., (1) a
      state of moral corruption, and (2) of guilt, as having
      judicially imputed to them the guilt of Adam&#39;s first
      sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Original sin&quot; is frequently and properly used to
      denote only the moral corruption of their whole nature
      inherited by all men from Adam. This inherited moral
      corruption consists in, (1) the loss of original
      righteousness; and (2) the presence of a constant proneness
      to evil, which is the root and origin of all actual sin. It
      is called &quot;sin&quot; (Rom. 6:12, 14, 17; 7:5-17), the
      &quot;flesh&quot; (Gal. 5:17, 24), &quot;lust&quot; (James
      1:14, 15), the &quot;body of sin&quot; (Rom. 6:6),
      &quot;ignorance,&quot; &quot;blindness of heart,&quot;
      &quot;alienation from the life of God&quot; (Eph. 4:18,
      19). It influences and depraves the whole man, and its
      tendency is still downward to deeper and deeper corruption,
      there remaining no recuperative element in the soul. It is
      a total depravity, and it is also universally inherited by
      all the natural descendants of Adam (Rom. 3:10-23; 5:12-21;
      8:7). Pelagians deny original sin, and regard man as by
      nature morally and spiritually well; semi-Pelagians regard
      him as morally sick; Augustinians, or, as they are also
      called, Calvinists, regard man as described above,
      spiritually dead (Eph. 2:1; 1 John 3:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of original sin is proved, (1.) From the fact
      of the universal sinfulness of men. &quot;There is no man
      that sinneth not&quot; (1 Kings 8:46; Isa. 53:6; Ps. 130:3;
      Rom. 3:19, 22, 23; Gal. 3:22). (2.) From the total
      depravity of man. All men are declared to be destitute of
      any principle of spiritual life; man&#39;s apostasy from
      God is total and complete (Job 15:14-16; Gen. 6:5,6). (3.)
      From its early manifestation (Ps. 58:3; Prov. 22:15). (4.)
      It is proved also from the necessity, absolutely and
      universally, of regeneration (John 3:3; 2 Cor. 5:17). (5.)
      From the universality of death (Rom. 5:12-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Various kinds of sin are mentioned, (1.) &quot;Presumptuous
      sins,&quot; or as literally rendered, &quot;sins with an
      uplifted hand&quot;, i.e., defiant acts of sin, in contrast
      with &quot;errors&quot; or &quot;inadvertencies&quot; (Ps.
      19:13). (2.) &quot;Secret&quot;, i.e., hidden sins (19:12);
      sins which escape the notice of the soul. (3.) &quot;Sin
      against the Holy Ghost&quot; (q.v.), or a &quot;sin unto
      death&quot; (Matt. 12:31, 32; 1 John 5:16), which amounts
      to a wilful rejection of grace.

    <p>
      Sin, a city in Egypt, called by the Greeks Pelusium, which
      means, as does also the Hebrew name, &quot;clayey&quot; or
      &quot;muddy,&quot; so called from the abundance of clay
      found there. It is called by Ezekel (Ezek. 30:15) &quot;the
      strength of Egypt, &quot;thus denoting its importance as a
      fortified city. It has been identified with the modern
      Tineh, &quot;a miry place,&quot; where its ruins are to be
      found. Of its boasted magnificence only four red granite
      columns remain, and some few fragments of others.

      <a name="T0003442"><b>Sinai -</b> of Sin (the moon god),
      called also Horeb, the name of the mountain district which
      was reached by the Hebrews in the third month after the
      Exodus. Here they remained encamped for about a whole year.
      Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment,
      including all the windings of the route, was about 150
      miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together
      with the whole of Leviticus and Num. ch. 1-11, contain a
      record of all the transactions which occurred while they
      were here. From Rephidim (Ex. 17:8-13) the Israelites
      journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady
      esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, &quot;the desert of
      Sinai,&quot; about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and
      encamped there &quot;before the mountain.&quot; The part of
      the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the
      Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from
      this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history.
      Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, &quot;The plain
      itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like
      almost all others in the range, but presents a long
      retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and
      stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in
      front of the whole congregation, and visible against the
      sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain,
      is the very image of the &#39;mount that might be
      touched,&#39; and from which the voice of God might be
      heard far and wide over the plain below.&quot; This was the
      scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the
      law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the
      plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their
      encampment here the Israelites passed through a very
      memorable experience. An immense change passed over them.
      They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant
      engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present
      divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month
      of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and
      march forward according to a prescribed order. After three
      days they reach the &quot;wilderness of Paran,&quot; the
      &quot;et-Tih&quot;, i.e., &quot;the desert&quot;, and here
      they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of
      discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested
      his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and
      inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah
      (q.v.), Num. 11:1-3. The journey between Sinai and the
      southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at
      Kadesh was accomplished in about a year. (See MAP facing

      <a name="T0003443"><b>Sinaiticus codex -</b> usually
      designated by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is
      one of the most valuable of ancient MSS. of the Greek New
      Testament. On the occasion of a third visit to the convent
      of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, in 1859, it was
      discovered by Dr. Tischendorf. He had on a previous visit
      in 1844 obtained forty-three parchment leaves of the LXX.,
      which he deposited in the university library of Leipsic,
      under the title of the Codex Frederico-Augustanus, after
      his royal patron the king of Saxony. In the year referred
      to (1859) the emperor of Russia sent him to prosecute his
      search for MSS., which he was convinced were still to be
      found in the Sinai convent. The story of his finding the
      manuscript of the New Testament has all the interest of a
      romance. He reached the convent on 31st January; but his
      inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On the 4th February he
      had resolved to return home without having gained his
      object. &quot;On that day, when walking with the provisor
      of the convent, he spoke with much regret of his
      ill-success. Returning from their promenade, Tischendorf
      accompanied the monk to his room, and there had displayed
      to him what his companion called a copy of the LXX., which
      he, the ghostly brother, owned. The MS. was wrapped up in a
      piece of cloth, and on its being unrolled, to the surprise
      and delight of the critic the very document presented
      itself which he had given up all hope of seeing. His object
      had been to complete the fragmentary LXX. of 1844, which he
      had declared to be the most ancient of all Greek codices on
      vellum that are extant; but he found not only that, but a
      copy of the Greek New Testament attached, of the same age,
      and perfectly complete, not wanting a single page or
      paragraph.&quot; This precious fragment, after some
      negotiations, he obtained possession of, and conveyed it to
      the Emperor Alexander, who fully appreciated its
      importance, and caused it to be published as nearly as
      possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the
      ancient handwriting. The entire codex consists of 346 1/2
      folios. Of these 199 belong to the Old Testament and 147
      1/2 to the New, along with two ancient documents called the
      Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The books
      of the New Testament stand thus: the four Gospels, the
      epistles of Paul, the Acts of the Apostles, the Catholic
      Epistles, the Apocalypse of John. It is shown by
      Tischendorf that this codex was written in the fourth
      century, and is thus of about the same age as the Vatican
      codex; but while the latter wants the greater part of
      Matthew and sundry leaves here and there besides, the
      Sinaiticus is the only copy of the New Testament in uncial
      characters which is complete. Thus it is the oldest extant
      MS. copy of the New Testament. Both the Vatican and the
      Sinai codices were probably written in Egypt. (See <a href=

      the law of, is given in detail in Lev. 4-6:13; 9:7-11,
      22-24; 12:6-8; 15:2, 14, 25-30; 14:19, 31; Num. 6:10-14. On
      the day of Atonement it was made with special solemnity
      (Lev. 16:5, 11, 15). The blood was then carried into the
      holy of holies and sprinkled on the mercy-seat.
      Sin-offerings were also presented at the five annual
      festivals (Num. 28, 29), and on the occasion of the
      consecration of the priests (Ex. 29:10-14, 36). As each
      individual, even the most private member of the
      congregation, as well as the congregation at large, and the
      high priest, was obliged, on being convicted by his
      conscience of any particular sin, to come with a
      sin-offering, we see thus impressively disclosed the need
      in which every sinner stands of the salvation of Christ,
      and the necessity of making application to it as often as
      the guilt of sin renews itself upon his conscience. This
      resort of faith to the perfect sacrifice of Christ is the
      one way that lies open for the sinner&#39;s attainment of
      pardon and restoration to peace. And then in the sacrifice
      itself there is the reality of that incomparable worth and
      preciousness which were so significantly represented in the
      sin-offering by the sacredness of its blood and the
      hallowed destination of its flesh. With reference to this
      the blood of Christ is called emphatically &quot;the
      precious blood,&quot; and the blood that &quot;cleanseth
      from all sin&quot; (1 John 1:7).</a>

      several miles toward the promontory of Ras Mohammed, the
      southern extremity of the Sinitic Peninsula. While the
      Israelites rested here for some days they began to murmur
      on account of the want of nourishment, as they had by this
      time consumed all the corn they had brought with them out
      of Egypt. God heard their murmurings, and gave them

      it with such force through his temples that it entered into

      &quot;slaves&quot; is the rendering of a Greek word meaning
      &quot;bodies.&quot; The Hebrew and Greek words for slave
      are usually rendered simply &quot;servant,&quot;
      &quot;bondman,&quot; or &quot;bondservant.&quot; Slavery as
      it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel.
      That law did not originate but only regulated the already
      existing custom of slavery (Ex. 21:20, 21, 26, 27; Lev.
      25:44-46; Josh. 9:6-27). The gospel in its spirit and

      the snail is evaporated. &quot;We find,&quot; he says,
      &quot;in all parts of the Holy Land myriads of snail-shells

      range is almost always within view throughout the whole
      year. The word is frequently used figuratively by the
      sacred writers (Job 24:19; Ps. 51:7; 68:14; Isa. 1:18). It
      is mentioned only once in the historical books (2 Sam.
      23:20). It was &quot;carried to Tyre, Sidon, and Damascus
      as a luxury, and labourers sweltering in the hot
      harvest-fields used it for the purpose of cooling the water
      which they drank (Prov. 25:13; Jer. 18:14). No doubt Herod
      Antipas, at his feasts in Tiberias, enjoyed also from this
      very source the modern luxury of ice-water.&quot;</a>

      ashes of certain plants, particularly the salsola kali
      (saltwort), which abounds on the shores of the Dead Sea and
      of the Mediterranean. It does not appear that the Hebrews
      were acquainted with what is now called &quot;soap,&quot;
      which is a compound of alkaline carbonates with oleaginous
      matter. The word &quot;purely&quot; in Isa. 1:25 (R.V.,
      &quot;throughly;&quot; marg., &quot;as with lye&quot;) is
      lit. &quot;as with <i>bor</i>.&quot; This word means
      &quot;clearness,&quot; and hence also that which makes
      clear, or pure, alkali. &quot;The ancients made use of
      alkali mingled with oil, instead of soap (Job 9:30), and
      also in smelting metals, to make them melt and flow more

      a city in the plain or lowland of Judah, where the
      Philistines encamped when they invaded Judah after their
      defeat at Michmash. It lay on the northern side of the
      valley of Elah (Wady es-Sunt). It has been identified with
      the modern Khurbet Shuweikeh, about 14 miles south-west of
      Jerusalem. In this campaign Goliath was slain, and the
      Philistines were completely routed.</a>

      city in the vale of Siddim (Gen. 13:10; 14:1-16). The
      wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire
      from heaven, by which it was destroyed (18:16-33; 19:1-29;
      Deut. 23:17). This city and its awful destruction are
      frequently alluded to in Scripture (Deut. 29:23; 32:32;
      Isa. 1:9, 10; 3:9; 13:19; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:46-56; Zeph.
      2:9; Matt. 10:15; Rom. 9:29; 2 Pet. 2:6, etc.). No trace of
      it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered,
      so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site
      of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a
      range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called
      Jebel Usdum, &quot;the hill of Sodom.&quot; It has been
      concluded, from this and from other considerations, that
      the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the
      Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability,
      contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in

      first after their legal marriage (2 Sam. 12). He was
      probably born about B.C. 1035 (1 Chr. 22:5; 29:1). He
      succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood,
      probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to
      whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah,
      i.e., &quot;beloved of the Lord&quot; (2 Sam. 12:24, 25).
      He was the first king of Israel &quot;born in the
      purple.&quot; His father chose him as his successor,
      passing over the claims of his elder sons: &quot;Assuredly
      Solomon my son shall reign after me.&quot; His history is
      recorded in 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chr. 1-9. His elevation to
      the throne took place before his father&#39;s death, and
      was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in
      consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (1 Kings 1:5-40).
      During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy
      gained its highest splendour. This period has well been
      called the &quot;Augustan age&quot; of the Jewish annals.
      The first half of his reign was, however, by far the
      brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded
      by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his
      heathen intermarriages (1 Kings 11:1-8; 14:21, 31).</a>

    <p>
      Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son
      (1 Kings 2:1-9; 1 Chr. 22:7-16; 28). As soon as he had
      settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of
      his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with
      Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh (1 Kings
      3:1), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He
      surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external
      grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government
      prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of
      Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous

      HIRAM</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years before his death David was engaged in the
      active work of collecting materials (1 Chr. 29:6-9; 2 Chr.
      2:3-7) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent
      abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to
      build the house of God (1 Chr. 22:8); that honour was
      reserved to his son Solomon. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003600.html&amp;from=T0003610&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      TEMPLE</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the
      erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem
      and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of
      thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal
      palace on Ophel (1 Kings 7:1-12). It was 100 cubits long,
      50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by
      forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a
      forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the
      name of &quot;The House of the Forest of Lebanon.&quot; In
      front of this &quot;house&quot; was another building, which
      was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again
      was the &quot;Hall of Judgment,&quot; or Throne-room (1
      Kings 7:7; 10:18-20; 2 Chr. 9:17-19), &quot;the King&#39;s
      Gate,&quot; where he administered justice and gave audience
      to his people. This palace was a building of great
      magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as
      the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of
      Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of
      red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of
      securing a plentiful supply of water for the city (Eccl.
      2:4-6). He then built Millo (LXX., &quot;Acra&quot;) for
      the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts
      around it (1 Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27). He erected also many
      other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at
      various points where it was exposed to the assault of
      enemies (1 Kings 9:15-19; 2 Chr. 8:2-6). Among his great
      undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor
      (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as
      a military outpost.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial
      prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with
      Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India
      and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast
      stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations (1 Kings
      9:26-28; 10:11, 12; 2 Chr. 8:17, 18; 9:21). This was the
      &quot;golden age&quot; of Israel. The royal magnificence
      and splendour of Solomon&#39;s court were unrivalled. He
      had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an
      evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his
      sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved
      immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was
      &quot;thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore
      measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the
      pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks,
      and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl&quot; (1 Kings 4:22, 23).
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon&#39;s reign was not only a period of great material
      prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual
      activity. He was the leader of his people also in this
      uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. &quot;He
      spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
      thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar
      tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth
      out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and
      of creeping things, and of fishes&quot; (1 Kings 4:32, 33).
    </p>
    <p>
      His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came
      from far and near &quot;to hear the wisdom of
      Solomon.&quot; Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was
      &quot;the queen of the south&quot; (Matt. 12:42), the queen
      of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. &quot;Deep, indeed,
      must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which
      induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the
      immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the
      energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so
      long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook,
      and carried it out with safety.&quot; (1 Kings 10:1-13; 2
      Chr. 9:1-12.) She was filled with amazement by all she saw
      and heard: &quot;there was no more spirit in her.&quot;
      After an interchange of presents she returned to her native
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The
      bright day of Solomon&#39;s glory ended in clouds and
      darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a
      sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his
      polygamy and his great wealth. &quot;As he grew older he
      spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king
      living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all
      their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces
      and pleasure-houses which he had built (1 Kings 11:3),
      learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their
      heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in
      the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer
      the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But
      his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely
      formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true
      religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious
      excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a
      worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord
      which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of
      Gideon (Judg. 8:27), or the Danites (Judg. 18:30, 31), but
      was downright idolatrous.&quot; (1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings
      23:13.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies
      prevailed against him (1 Kings 11:14-22, 23-25, 26-40), and
      one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the
      end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years,
      and was buried in the city of David, and &quot;with him was
      buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel.&quot;
      &quot;He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son,
      to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The kingdom of Solomon,&quot; says Rawlinson,
      &quot;is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical
      history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has
      with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the
      midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn
      exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly
      raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and
      greatness. An empire is established which extends from the
      Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles;
      and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost
      immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a
      century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence,
      artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of
      dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed
      during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden
      collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the
      subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained
      being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife,
      oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate
      effort, re-commences.&quot;, Historical Illustrations.

      <a name="T0003474"><b>Solomon, Song of -</b> called also,
      after the Vulgate, the &quot;Canticles.&quot; It is the
      &quot;song of songs&quot; (1:1), as being the finest and
      most precious of its kind; the noblest song, &quot;das
      Hohelied,&quot; as Luther calls it. The Solomonic
      authorship of this book has been called in question, but
      evidences, both internal and external, fairly establish the
      traditional view that it is the product of Solomon&#39;s
      pen. It is an allegorical poem setting forth the mutual
      love of Christ and the Church, under the emblem of the
      bridegroom and the bride. (Compare Matt. 9:15; John 3:29;
      Eph. 5:23, 27, 29; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9; 22:17. Compare
      also Ps. 45; Isa. 54:4-6; 62:4, 5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1, 20; Ezek.
      16; Hos. 2:16, 19, 20.)</a>

      10:23; Acts 3:11; 5:12), a colonnade, or cloister probably,
      on the eastern side of the temple. It is not mentioned in
      connection with the first temple, but Josephus mentions a
      porch, so called, in Herod&#39;s temple (q.v.).</a>

      21:17; Deut. 32; Rev. 15:3), Deborah (Judg. 5), Hannah (1
      Sam. 2), David (2 Sam. 22, and Psalms), Mary (Luke
      1:46-55), Zacharias (Luke 1:68-79), the angels (Luke 2:13),
      Simeon (Luke 2:29), the redeemed (Rev. 5:9; 19), Solomon
      (see SOLOMON, SONGS OF &macr;T0003474).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003477"><b>Son of God -</b> The plural,
      &quot;sons of God,&quot; is used (Gen. 6:2, 4) to denote
      the pious descendants of Seth. In Job 1:6; 38:7 this name
      is applied to the angels. Hosea uses the phrase (1:10) to
      designate the gracious relation in which men stand to
      God.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament this phrase frequently denotes the
      relation into which we are brought to God by adoption (Rom.
      8:14, 19; 2 Cor. 6:18; Gal. 4:5, 6; Phil. 2:15; 1 John 3:1,
      2). It occurs thirty-seven times in the New Testament as
      the distinctive title of our Saviour. He does not bear this
      title in consequence of his miraculous birth, nor of his
      incarnation, his resurrection, and exaltation to the
      Father&#39;s right hand. This is a title of nature and not
      of office. The sonship of Christ denotes his equality with
      the Father. To call Christ the Son of God is to assert his
      true and proper divinity. The second Person of the Trinity,
      because of his eternal relation to the first Person, is the
      Son of God. He is the Son of God as to his divine nature,
      while as to his human nature he is the Son of David (Rom.
      1:3, 4. Comp. Gal. 4:4; John 1:1-14; 5:18-25; 10:30-38,
      which prove that Christ was the Son of God before his
      incarnation, and that his claim to this title is a claim of
      equality with God).
    </p>
    <p>
      When used with reference to creatures, whether men or
      angels, this word is always in the plural. In the singular
      it is always used of the second Person of the Trinity, with
      the single exception of Luke 3:38, where it is used of
      Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003478"><b>Son of man -</b> (1.) Denotes mankind
      generally, with special reference to their weakness and
      frailty (Job 25:6; Ps. 8:4; 144:3; 146:3; Isa. 51:12,
      etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) It is a title frequently given to the prophet Ezekiel,
      probably to remind him of his human weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In the New Testament it is used forty-three times as a
      distinctive title of the Saviour. In the Old Testament it
      is used only in Ps. 80:17 and Dan. 7:13 with this
      application. It denotes the true humanity of our Lord. He
      had a true body (Heb. 2:14; Luke 24:39) and a rational
      soul. He was perfect man.

      2:6 and Micah 5:12 (Heb. yonenim, i.e., &quot;diviners of
      the clouds&quot;) the word is used of the Chaldean diviners
      who studied the clouds. In Dan. 2:27; 5:7 the word is the
      rendering of the Chaldee gazrin, i.e., &quot;deciders&quot;
      or &quot;determiners&quot;, here applied to Chaldean
      astrologers, &quot;who, by casting nativities from the
      place of the stars at one&#39;s birth, and by various arts
      of computing and divining, foretold the fortunes and

      represent the spider, of which there are, it is said, about
      seven hundred species in Palestine.

      <a name="T0003493"><b>Spies -</b> When the Israelites
      reached Kadesh for the first time, and were encamped there,
      Moses selected twelve spies from among the chiefs of the
      divisions of the tribes, and sent them forth to spy the
      land of Canaan (Num. 13), and to bring back to him a report
      of its actual condition. They at once proceeded on their
      important errand, and went through the land as far north as
      the district round Lake Merom. After about six weeks&#39;
      absence they returned. Their report was very discouraging,
      and the people were greatly alarmed, and in a rebellious
      spirit proposed to elect a new leader and return to Egypt.
      Only two of the spies, Caleb and Joshua, showed themselves
      on this occasion stout-hearted and faithful. All their
      appeals and remonstrances were in vain. Moses announced
      that as a punishment for their rebellion they must now
      wander in the wilderness till a new generation should arise
      which would go up and posses the land. The spies had been
      forty days absent on their expedition, and for each day the
      Israelites were to be wanderers for a year in the desert.

      Two spies were sent by Joshua &quot;secretly&quot; i.e.,
      unknown to the people (Josh. 2:1), &quot;to view the land
      and Jericho&quot; after the death of Moses, and just before
      the tribes under his leadership were about to cross the
      Jordan. They learned from Rahab (q.v.), in whose house they
      found a hiding-place, that terror had fallen on all the
      inhabitants of the land because of the great things they
      had heard that Jehovah had done for them (Ex. 15:14-16;
      comp. 23:27; Deut. 2:25; 11:25). As the result of their
      mission they reported: &quot;Truly Jehovah hath delivered
      into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants
      of the country do faint because of us.&quot;

      <a name="T0003494"><b>Spikenard -</b> (Heb. nerd), a
      much-valued perfume (Cant. 1:12; 4:13, 14). It was
      &quot;very precious&quot;, i.e., very costly (Mark 14:3;
      John 12:3,5). It is the root of an Indian plant, the
      Nardostachys jatamansi, of the family of Valeriance,
      growing on the Himalaya mountains. It is distinguished by
      its having many hairy spikes shooting out from one root. It
      is called by the Arabs sunbul Hindi, &quot;the Indian
      spike.&quot; In the New Testament this word is the
      rendering of the Greek nardos pistike. The margin of the
      Revised Version in these passages has &quot;pistic
      nard,&quot; pistic being perhaps a local name. Some take it
      to mean genuine, and others liquid. The most probable
      opinion is that the word pistike designates the nard as
      genuine or faithfully prepared.</a>

      <a name="T0003495"><b>Spirit -</b> (Heb. ruah; Gr. pneuma),
      properly wind or breath. In 2 Thess. 2:8 it means
      &quot;breath,&quot; and in Eccl. 8:8 the vital principle in
      man. It also denotes the rational, immortal soul by which
      man is distinguished (Acts 7:59; 1 Cor. 5:5; 6:20; 7:34),
      and the soul in its separate state (Heb. 12:23), and hence
      also an apparition (Job 4:15; Luke 24:37, 39), an angel
      (Heb. 1:14), and a demon (Luke 4:36; 10:20). This word is
      used also metaphorically as denoting a tendency (Zech.
      12:10; Luke 13:11).</a>

    <p>
      In Rom. 1:4, 1 Tim. 3:16, 2 Cor. 3:17, 1 Pet. 3:18, it
      designates the divine nature.

      Josh. 10:40 (Heb. &#39;ashdoth) should rather be

      the undulating ground lying between the lowlands (the
      shephelah) and the central range of hills. </a>
