      <a name="T0003500"><b>Stachys -</b> spike; an ear of corn,
      a convert at Rome whom Paul salutes (Rom. 16:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003501"><b>Stacte -</b> (Heb. nataph), one of
      the components of the perfume which was offered on the
      golden altar (Ex. 30:34; R.V. marg.,
      &quot;opobalsamum&quot;). The Hebrew word is from a root
      meaning &quot;to distil,&quot; and it has been by some
      interpreted as distilled myrrh. Others regard it as the gum
      of the storax tree, or rather shrub, the Styrax officinale.
      &quot;The Syrians value this gum highly, and use it
      medicinally as an emulcent in pectoral complaints, and also
      in perfumery.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003502"><b>Stargazers -</b> (Isa. 47:13), those
      who pretend to tell what will occur by looking upon the
      stars. The Chaldean astrologers &quot;divined by the rising
      and setting, the motions, aspects, colour, degree of light,
      etc., of the stars.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003503"><b>Star, Morning -</b> a name
      figuratively given to Christ (Rev. 22:16; comp. 2 Pet.
      1:19). When Christ promises that he will give the
      &quot;morning star&quot; to his faithful ones, he
      &quot;promises that he will give to them himself, that he
      will give to them himself, that he will impart to them his
      own glory and a share in his own royal dominion; for the
      star is evermore the symbol of royalty (Matt. 2:2), being
      therefore linked with the sceptre (Num. 24:17). All the
      glory of the world shall end in being the glory of the
      Church.&quot; Trench&#39;s Comm.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003504"><b>Stars -</b> The eleven stars (Gen.
      37:9); the seven (Amos 5:8); wandering (Jude 1:13); seen in
      the east at the birth of Christ, probably some luminous
      meteors miraculously formed for this specific purpose
      (Matt. 2:2-10); stars worshipped (Deut. 4:19; 2 Kings
      17:16; 21:3; Jer. 19:13); spoken of symbolically (Num.
      24:17; Rev. 1:16, 20; 12:1). (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0003505"><b>Stater -</b> Greek word rendered
      &quot;piece of money&quot; (Matt. 17:27, A.V.; and
      &quot;shekel&quot; in R.V.). It was equal to two didrachmas
      (&quot;tribute money,&quot; 17:24), or four drachmas, and
      to about 2s. 6d. of our money. (See <a href=

      THEFT</a>.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003507"><b>Steel -</b> The &quot;bow of
      steel&quot; in (A.V.) 2 Sam. 22:35; Job 20:24; Ps. 18:34 is
      in the Revised Version &quot;bow of brass&quot; (Heb.
      kesheth-nehushah). In Jer. 15:12 the same word is used, and
      is also rendered in the Revised Version &quot;brass.&quot;
      But more correctly it is copper (q.v.), as brass in the
      ordinary sense of the word (an alloy of copper and zinc)
      was not known to the ancients.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003508"><b>Stephanas -</b> crown, a member of
      the church at Corinth, whose family were among those the
      apostle had baptized (1 Cor. 1:16; 16:15, 17). He has been
      supposed by some to have been the &quot;jailer of
      Philippi&quot; (comp. Acts 16:33). The First Epistle to the
      Corinthians was written from Philippi some six years after
      the jailer&#39;s conversion, and he was with the apostle
      there at that time.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003509"><b>Stephen -</b> one of the seven
      deacons, who became a preacher of the gospel. He was the
      first Christian martyr. His personal character and history
      are recorded in Acts 6. &quot;He fell asleep&quot; with a
      prayer for his persecutors on his lips (7:60). Devout men
      carried him to his grave (8:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus,
      that those who stoned him laid their clothes (comp. Deut.
      17:5-7) before they began their cruel work. The scene which
      Saul then witnessed and the words he heard appear to have
      made a deep and lasting impression on his mind (Acts 22:19,
      20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first
      apology for the universalism of the gospel as a message to
      the Gentiles as well as the Jews. It is the longest speech
      contained in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to
      it as a defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003510"><b>Stoics -</b> a sect of Greek
      philosophers at Athens, so called from the Greek word stoa
      i.e., a &quot;porch&quot; or &quot;portico,&quot; where
      they have been called &quot;the Pharisees of Greek
      paganism.&quot; The founder of the Stoics was Zeno, who
      flourished about B.C. 300. He taught his disciples that a
      man&#39;s happiness consisted in bringing himself into
      harmony with the course of the universe. They were trained
      to bear evils with indifference, and so to be independent
      of externals. Materialism, pantheism, fatalism, and pride
      were the leading features of this philosophy.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003511"><b>Stomacher -</b> (Isa. 3:24), an
      article of female attire, probably some sort of girdle
      around the breast.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003512"><b>Stone -</b> Stones were commonly used
      for buildings, also as memorials of important events (Gen.
      28:18; Josh. 24:26, 27; 1 Sam. 7:12, etc.). They were
      gathered out of cultivated fields (Isa. 5:2; comp. 2 Kings
      3:19). This word is also used figuratively of believers (1
      Pet. 2:4, 5), and of the Messiah (Ps. 118:22; Isa. 28:16;
      Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11, etc.). In Dan. 2:45 it refers also
      to the Messiah. He is there described as &quot;cut out of
      the mountain.&quot; (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003100.html&amp;from=T0003148&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      ROCK</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A &quot;heart of stone&quot; denotes great insensibility (1
      Sam. 25:37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Stones were set up to commemorate remarkable events, as by
      Jacob at Bethel (Gen. 28:18), at Padan-aram (35:4), and on
      the occasion of parting with Laban (31:45-47); by Joshua at
      the place on the banks of the Jordan where the people first
      &quot;lodged&quot; after crossing the river (Josh. 6:8),
      and also in &quot;the midst of Jordan,&quot; where he
      erected another set of twelve stones (4:1-9); and by Samuel
      at &quot;Ebenezer&quot; (1 Sam. 7:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003513"><b>Stones, Precious -</b> Frequently
      referred to (1 Kings 10:2; 2 Chr. 3:6; 9:10; Rev. 18:16;
      21:19). There are about twenty different names of such
      stones in the Bible. They are figuratively introduced to
      denote value, beauty, durability (Cant. 5:14; Isa 54:11,
      12; Lam. 4:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003514"><b>Stoning -</b> a form of punishment
      (Lev. 20:2; 24:14; Deut. 13:10; 17:5; 22:21) prescribed for
      certain offences. Of Achan (Josh. 7:25), Naboth (1 Kings
      21), Stephen (Acts 7:59), Paul (Acts 14:19; 2 Cor.
      11:25).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003515"><b>Stork -</b> Heb. hasidah, meaning
      &quot;kindness,&quot; indicating thus the character of the
      bird, which is noted for its affection for its young. It is
      in the list of birds forbidden to be eaten by the Levitical
      law (Lev. 11:19; Deut. 14:18). It is like the crane, but
      larger in size. Two species are found in Palestine, the
      white, which are dispersed in pairs over the whole country;
      and the black, which live in marshy places and in great
      flocks. They migrate to Palestine periodically (about the
      22nd of March). Jeremiah alludes to this (Jer. 8:7). At the
      appointed time they return with unerring sagacity to their
      old haunts, and re-occupy their old nests. &quot;There is a
      well-authenticated account of the devotion of a stork
      which, at the burning of the town of Delft, after repeated
      and unsuccessful attempts to carry off her young, chose
      rather to remain and perish with them than leave them to
      their fate. Well might the Romans call it the pia
      avis!&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Job 39:13 (A.V.), instead of the expression &quot;or
      wings and feathers unto the ostrich&quot; (marg., &quot;the
      feathers of the stork and ostrich&quot;), the Revised
      Version has &quot;are her pinions and feathers kindly&quot;
      (marg., instead of &quot;kindly,&quot; reads &quot;like the
      stork&#39;s&quot;). The object of this somewhat obscure
      verse seems to be to point out a contrast between the
      stork, as distinguished for her affection for her young,
      and the ostrich, as distinguished for her indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zechariah (5:9) alludes to the beauty and power of the
      stork&#39;s wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003516"><b>Strain at -</b> Simply a misprint for
      &quot;strain out&quot; (Matt. 23:24).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003517"><b>Stranger -</b> This word generally
      denotes a person from a foreign land residing in Palestine.
      Such persons enjoyed many privileges in common with the
      Jews, but still were separate from them. The relation of
      the Jews to strangers was regulated by special laws (Deut.
      23:3; 24:14-21; 25:5; 26:10-13). A special signification is
      also sometimes attached to this word. In Gen. 23:4 it
      denotes one resident in a foreign land; Ex. 23:9, one who
      is not a Jew; Num. 3:10, one who is not of the family of
      Aaron; Ps. 69:8, an alien or an unknown person. The Jews
      were allowed to purchase strangers as slaves (Lev. 25:44,
      45), and to take usury from them (Deut. 23:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003518"><b>Straw -</b> Used in brick-making (Ex.
      5:7-18). Used figuratively in Job 41:27; Isa. 11:7; 25:10;
      65:25.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003519"><b>Stream of Egypt -</b> (Isa. 27:12),
      the Wady el-&#39;Arish, called also &quot;the river of
      Egypt,&quot; R.V., &quot;brook of Egypt&quot; (Num. 34:5;
      Josh. 15:4; 2 Kings 24:7). It is the natural boundary of
      Egypt. Occasionally in winter, when heavy rains have fallen
      among the mountains inland, it becomes a turbulent rushing
      torrent. The present boundary between Egypt and Palestine
      is about midway between el-&#39;Arish and Gaza.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003520"><b>Street -</b> The street called
      &quot;Straight&quot; at Damascus (Acts 9:11) is &quot;a
      long broad street, running from east to west, about a mile
      in length, and forming the principal thoroughfare in the
      city.&quot; In Oriental towns streets are usually narrow
      and irregular and filthy (Ps. 18:42; Isa. 10:6). &quot;It
      is remarkable,&quot; says Porter, &quot;that all the
      important cities of Palestine and Syria Samaria, Caesarea,
      Gerasa, Bozrah, Damascus, Palmyra, had their &#39;straight
      streets&#39; running through the centre of the city, and
      lined with stately rows of columns. The most perfect now
      remaining are those of Palmyra and Gerasa, where long
      ranges of the columns still stand.&quot;, Through Samaria,
      etc.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003521"><b>Stripes -</b> as a punishment were
      not to exceed forty (Deut. 25:1-3), and hence arose the
      custom of limiting them to thirty-nine (2 Cor. 11:24). Paul
      claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen in regard to the
      infliction of stripes (Acts 16:37, 38; 22:25-29). Our Lord
      was beaten with stripes (Matt. 27:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003522"><b>Subscriptions -</b> The subscriptions
      to Paul&#39;s epistles are no part of the original. In
      their present form they are ascribed to Euthalius, a bishop
      of the fifth century. Some of them are obviously
      incorrect.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003523"><b>Suburbs -</b> the immediate vicinity
      of a city or town (Num. 35:3, 7; Ezek. 45:2). In 2 Kings
      23:11 the Hebrew word there used (parvarim) occurs nowhere
      else. The Revised Version renders it &quot;precincts.&quot;
      The singular form of this Hebrew word (parvar) is supposed
      by some to be the same as Parbar (q.v.), which occurs twice
      in 1 Chr. 26:18.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003524"><b>Succoth -</b> booths. (1.) The first
      encampment of the Israelites after leaving Ramesses (Ex.
      12:37); the civil name of Pithom (q.v.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A city on the east of Jordan, identified with Tell
      Dar&#39;ala, a high mound, a mass of debris, in the plain
      north of Jabbok and about one mile from it (Josh. 13:27).
      Here Jacob (Gen. 32:17, 30; 33:17), on his return from
      Padan-aram after his interview with Esau, built a house for
      himself and made booths for his cattle. The princes of this
      city churlishly refused to afford help to Gideon and his
      300 men when &quot;faint yet pursuing&quot; they followed
      one of the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great
      victory at Gilboa. After overtaking and routing this band
      at Karkor, Gideon on his return visited the rulers of the
      city with severe punishment. &quot;He took the elders of
      the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with
      them he taught the men of Succoth&quot; (Judg. 8:13-16). At
      this place were erected the foundries for casting the
      metal-work for the temple (1 Kings 7:46).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003525"><b>Succoth-benoth -</b> tents of
      daughters, supposed to be the name of a Babylonian deity,
      the goddess Zir-banit, the wife of Merodach, worshipped by
      the colonists in Samaria (2 Kings 17:30).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003526"><b>Sukkiims -</b> dwellers in tents,
      (Vulg. and LXX., &quot;troglodites;&quot; i.e.,
      cave-dwellers in the hills along the Red Sea).
      Shiskak&#39;s army, with which he marched against
      Jerusalem, was composed partly of this tribe (2 Chr.
      12:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003527"><b>Sun -</b> (Heb. shemesh), first
      mentioned along with the moon as the two great luminaries
      of heaven (Gen. 1:14-18). By their motions and influence
      they were intended to mark and divide times and seasons.
      The worship of the sun was one of the oldest forms of false
      religion (Job 31:26,27), and was common among the Egyptians
      and Chaldeans and other pagan nations. The Jews were warned
      against this form of idolatry (Deut. 4:19; 17:3; comp. 2
      Kings 23:11; Jer. 19:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003528"><b>Suph -</b> (Deut. 1:1, R.V.; marg.,
      &quot;some ancient versions have the Red Sea,&quot; as in
      the A.V.). Some identify it with Suphah (Num. 21:14, marg.,
      A.V.) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it
      with es-Sufah = Maaleh-acrabbim (Josh. 15:3), and others
      again with Zuph (1 Sam. 9:5). It is most probable, however,
      that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is
      to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam-suph, i.e.,
      the &quot;Red Sea.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003529"><b>Suphah -</b> (Num. 21:14, marg.; also

      a regular migrant, returning in myriads every spring, and
      so suddenly that while one day not a swift can be seen in
      the country, on the next they have overspread the whole

      for its swiftness of flight, its love of freedom, and the
      impossibility of retaining it in captivity. In Isa. 38:14
      and Jer. 8:7 the word thus rendered (&#39;augr) properly

      the most unclean and the most abhorred of all animals (Lev.

      Prov. 12:18). The word of God is likened also to a sword
      (Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17; Rev. 1:16). Gideon&#39;s watchword
      was, &quot;The sword of the Lord&quot; (Judg. 7:20).

      Luke 17:6. It is rendered by Luther &quot;mulberry
      tree&quot; (q.v.), which is most probably the correct
      rendering. It is found of two species, the black mulberry
      (Morus nigra) and the white mulberry (Mourea), which are
      common in Palestine. The silk-worm feeds on their leaves.
      The rearing of them is one of the chief industries of the
      peasantry of Lebanon and of other parts of the land. It is
      of the order of the fig-tree. Some contend, however, that
      this name denotes the sycamore-fig of Luke 19:4.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003541"><b>Sycamore -</b> more properly sycomore
      (Heb. shikmoth and shikmim, Gr. sycomoros), a tree which in
      its general character resembles the fig-tree, while its
      leaves resemble those of the mulberry; hence it is called
      the fig-mulberry (Ficus sycomorus). At Jericho, Zacchaeus
      climbed a sycomore-tree to see Jesus as he passed by (Luke
      19:4). This tree was easily destroyed by frost (Ps. 78:47),
      and therefore it is found mostly in the &quot;vale&quot; (1
      Kings 10:27; 2 Chr. 1:15: in both passages the R.V. has
      properly &quot;lowland&quot;), i.e., the &quot;low
      country,&quot; the shephelah, where the climate is mild.
      Amos (7:14) refers to its fruit, which is of an inferior
      character; so also probably Jeremiah (24:2). It is to be
      distinguished from our sycamore (the Acer pseudo-platanus),

      called Assouan, on the right bank of the Nile, notable for
      its quarries of beautiful red granite called

      <a name="T0003545"><b>Synagogue -</b> (Gr. sunagoge, i.e.,
      &quot;an assembly&quot;), found only once in the Authorized
      Version of Ps. 74:8, where the margin of Revised Version
      has &quot;places of assembly,&quot; which is probably
      correct; for while the origin of synagogues is unknown, it
      may well be supposed that buildings or tents for the
      accommodation of worshippers may have existed in the land
      from an early time, and thus the system of synagogues would
      be gradually developed.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some, however, are of opinion that it was specially during
      the Babylonian captivity that the system of synagogue
      worship, if not actually introduced, was at least
      reorganized on a systematic plan (Ezek. 8:1; 14:1). The
      exiles gathered together for the reading of the law and the
      prophets as they had opportunity, and after their return
      synagogues were established all over the land (Ezra 8:15;
      Neh. 8:2). In after years, when the Jews were dispersed
      abroad, wherever they went they erected synagogues and kept
      up the stated services of worship (Acts 9:20; 13:5; 17:1;
      17:17; 18:4). The form and internal arrangements of the
      synagogue would greatly depend on the wealth of the Jews
      who erected it, and on the place where it was built.
      &quot;Yet there are certain traditional pecularities which
      have doubtless united together by a common resemblance the
      Jewish synagogues of all ages and countries. The
      arrangements for the women&#39;s place in a separate
      gallery or behind a partition of lattice-work; the desk in
      the centre, where the reader, like Ezra in ancient days,
      from his &#39;pulpit of wood,&#39; may &#39;open the book
      in the sight of all of people and read in the book of the
      law of God distinctly, and give the sense, and cause them
      to understand the reading&#39; (Neh. 8:4, 8); the carefully
      closed ark on the side of the building nearest to
      Jerusalem, for the preservation of the rolls or manuscripts
      of the law; the seats all round the building, whence
      &#39;the eyes of all them that are in the synagogue&#39;
      may &#39;be fastened&#39; on him who speaks (Luke 4:20);
      the &#39;chief seats&#39; (Matt. 23:6) which were
      appropriated to the &#39;ruler&#39; or &#39;rulers&#39; of
      the synagogue, according as its organization may have been
      more or less complete;&quot;, these were features common to
      all the synagogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where perfected into a system, the services of the
      synagogue, which were at the same hours as those of the
      temple, consisted, (1) of prayer, which formed a kind of
      liturgy, there were in all eighteen prayers; (2) the
      reading of the Scriptures in certain definite portions; and
      (3) the exposition of the portions read. (See Luke 4:15,
      22; Acts 13:14.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The synagogue was also sometimes used as a court of
      judicature, in which the rulers presided (Matt. 10:17; Mark
      5:22; Luke 12:11; 21:12; Acts 13:15; 22:19); also as public
      schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The establishment of synagogues wherever the Jews were
      found in sufficient numbers helped greatly to keep alive
      Israel&#39;s hope of the coming of the Messiah, and to
      prepare the way for the spread of the gospel in other
      lands. The worship of the Christian Church was afterwards
      modelled after that of the synagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ and his disciples frequently taught in the
      synagogues (Matt. 13:54; Mark 6:2; John 18:20; Acts 13:5,
      15, 44; 14:1; 17:2-4, 10, 17; 18:4, 26; 19:8).

    <p>
      To be &quot;put out of the synagogue,&quot; a phrase used
      by John (9:22; 12:42; 16:2), means to be excommunicated.

      24:10; Deut. 23:4) Aram-naharain (=Syria of the two
      rivers), also Padan-aram (Gen. 25:20). Other portions of
      Syria were also known by separate names, as Aram-maahah (1
      Chr. 19:6), Aram-beth-rehob (2 Sam. 10:6), Aram-zobah (2
      Sam. 10:6, 8). All these separate little kingdoms
      afterwards became subject to Damascus. In the time of the
      Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia
      Minor.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;From the historic annals now accessible to us, the
      history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The
      first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was
      dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the
      merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty
      conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim
      dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks
      of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert.
      Second, this was followed by a short period of
      independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was
      growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the
      golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich
      cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and
      sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north
      the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies
      of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most
      interesting, period is that during which the kings of
      Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre,
      Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering
      armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at
      last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers
      of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed
      with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so
      clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets.&quot;, Boscawen.

      9:15); the &quot;tabernacle of witness&quot; (Num. 17:8);
      the &quot;house of the Lord&quot; (Deut. 23:18); the
      &quot;temple of the Lord&quot; (Josh. 6:24); a
      &quot;sanctuary&quot; (Ex. 25:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      A particular account of the materials which the people
      provided for the erection and of the building itself is
      recorded in Ex. 25-40. The execution of the plan
      mysteriously given to Moses was intrusted to Bezaleel and
      Aholiab, who were specially endowed with wisdom and
      artistic skill, probably gained in Egypt, for this purpose
      (Ex. 35:30-35). The people provided materials for the
      tabernacle so abundantly that Moses was under the necessity
      of restraining them (36:6). These stores, from which they
      so liberally contributed for this purpose, must have
      consisted in a great part of the gifts which the Egyptians
      so readily bestowed on them on the eve of the Exodus
      (12:35, 36).
    </p>
    <p>
      The tabernacle was a rectangular enclosure, in length about
      45 feet (i.e., reckoning a cubit at 18 inches) and in
      breadth and height about 15. Its two sides and its western
      end were made of boards of acacia wood, placed on end,
      resting in sockets of brass, the eastern end being left
      open (Ex. 26:22). This framework was covered with four
      coverings, the first of linen, in which figures of the
      symbolic cherubim were wrought with needlework in blue and
      purple and scarlet threads, and probably also with threads
      of gold (Ex. 26:1-6; 36:8-13). Above this was a second
      covering of twelve curtains of black goats&#39;-hair cloth,
      reaching down on the outside almost to the ground (Ex.
      26:7-11). The third covering was of rams&#39; skins dyed
      red, and the fourth was of badgers&#39; skins (Heb. tahash,
      i.e., the dugong, a species of seal), Ex. 25:5; 26:14;
      35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally it was divided by a veil into two chambers, the
      exterior of which was called the holy place, also &quot;the
      sanctuary&quot; (Heb. 9:2) and the &quot;first
      tabernacle&quot; (6); and the interior, the holy of holies,
      &quot;the holy place,&quot; &quot;the Holiest,&quot; the
      &quot;second tabernacle&quot; (Ex. 28:29; Heb. 9:3, 7). The
      veil separating these two chambers was a double curtain of
      the finest workmanship, which was never passed except by
      the high priest once a year, on the great Day of Atonement.
      The holy place was separated from the outer court which
      enclosed the tabernacle by a curtain, which hung over the
      six pillars which stood at the east end of the tabernacle,
      and by which it was entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order as well as the typical character of the services
      of the tabernacle are recorded in Heb. 9; 10:19-22.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holy of holies, a cube of 10 cubits, contained the
      &quot;ark of the testimony&quot;, i.e., the oblong chest
      containing the two tables of stone, the pot of manna, and
      Aaron&#39;s rod that budded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holy place was the western and larger chamber of the
      tabernacle. Here were placed the table for the shewbread,
      the golden candlestick, and the golden altar of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round about the tabernacle was a court, enclosed by
      curtains hung upon sixty pillars (Ex. 27:9-18). This court
      was 150 feet long and 75 feet broad. Within it were placed
      the altar of burnt offering, which measured 7 1/2 feet in
      length and breadth and 4 1/2 feet high, with horns at the
      four corners, and the laver of brass (Ex. 30:18), which
      stood between the altar and the tabernacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole tabernacle was completed in seven months. On the
      first day of the first month of the second year after the
      Exodus, it was formally set up, and the cloud of the divine
      presence descended on it (Ex. 39:22-43; 40:1-38). It cost
      29 talents 730 shekels of gold, 100 talents 1,775 shekels
      of silver, 70 talents 2,400 shekels of brass (Ex.
      38:24-31).
    </p>
    <p>
      The tabernacle was so constructed that it could easily be
      taken down and conveyed from place to place during the
      wanderings in the wilderness. The first encampment of the
      Israelites after crossing the Jordan was at Gilgal, and
      there the tabernacle remained for seven years (Josh. 4:19).
      It was afterwards removed to Shiloh (Josh. 18:1), where it
      remained during the time of the Judges, till the days of
      Eli, when the ark, having been carried out into the camp
      when the Israelites were at war with the Philistines, was
      taken by the enemy (1 Sam. 4), and was never afterwards
      restored to its place in the tabernacle. The old tabernacle
      erected by Moses in the wilderness was transferred to Nob
      (1 Sam. 21:1), and after the destruction of that city by
      Saul (22:9; 1 Chr. 16:39, 40), to Gibeon. It is mentioned
      for the last time in 1 Chr. 21:29. A new tabernacle was
      erected by David at Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:17; 1 Chr. 16:1),
      and the ark was brought from Perez-uzzah and deposited in
      it (2 Sam. 6:8-17; 2 Chr. 1:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The word thus rendered (&#39;ohel) in Ex. 33:7 denotes
      simply a tent, probably Moses&#39; own tent, for the
      tabernacle was not yet erected.

      <a name="T0003560"><b>Tabernacles, Feast of -</b> the third
      of the great annual festivals of the Jews (Lev. 23:33-43).
      It is also called the &quot;feast of ingathering&quot; (Ex.
      23:16; Deut. 16:13). It was celebrated immediately after
      the harvest, in the month Tisri, and the celebration lasted
      for eight days (Lev. 23:33-43). During that period the
      people left their homes and lived in booths formed of the
      branches of trees. The sacrifices offered at this time are
      mentioned in Num. 29:13-38. It was at the time of this
      feast that Solomon&#39;s temple was dedicated (1 Kings
      8:2). Mention is made of it after the return from the
      Captivity. This feast was designed (1) to be a memorial of
      the wilderness wanderings, when the people dwelt in booths
      (Lev. 23:43), and (2) to be a harvest thanksgiving (Neh.
      8:9-18). The Jews, at a later time, introduced two
      appendages to the original festival, viz., (1) that of
      drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, and pouring it upon
      the altar (John 7:2, 37), as a memorial of the water from
      the rock in Horeb; and (2) of lighting the lamps at night,
      a memorial of the pillar of fire by night during their
      wanderings.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The feast of Tabernacles, the harvest festival of the
      Jewish Church, was the most popular and important festival
      after the Captivity. At Jerusalem it was a gala day. It was
      to the autumn pilgrims, who arrived on the 14th (of the
      month Tisri, the feast beginning on the 15th) day, like
      entrance into a silvan city. Roofs and courtyards, streets
      and squares, roads and gardens, were green with boughs of
      citron and myrtle, palm and willow. The booths recalled the
      pilgrimage through the wilderness. The ingathering of
      fruits prophesied of the spiritual harvest.&quot;,

      <a name="T0003561"><b>Tabitha -</b> (in Greek called
      Dorcas), gazelle, a disciple at Joppa. She was
      distinguished for her alms-deeds and good works. Peter, who
      was sent for from Lydda on the occasion of her death,
      prayed over the dead body, and said, &quot;Tabitha,
      arise.&quot; And she opened her eyes and sat up; and Peter
      &quot;gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the
      saints and widows, he presented her alive&quot; (Acts
      9:36-43).</a>

      when at meals. This custom, along with the use of raised
      tables like ours, was introduced among the Jews after the
      Captivity. Before this they had, properly speaking, no
      table. That which served the purpose was a skin or piece of
      leather spread out on the carpeted floor. Sometimes a stool
      was placed in the middle of this skin. (See ABRAHAM&#39;S

      from the summit of it is said to be singularly extensive
      and grand. This is alluded to in Ps. 89:12; Jer. 46:18. It
      was here that Barak encamped before the battle with Sisera
      (q.v.) Judg. 4:6-14. There is an old tradition, which,

      evidently led the psalmist to associate it with Hermon, the

      (2.) The name of a place which first comes into notice in
      the days of Solomon. The question as to the locality of
      Tarshish has given rise to not a little discussion. Some
      think there was a Tarshish in the East, on the Indian
      coast, seeing that &quot;ships of Tarshish&quot; sailed
      from Eziongeber, on the Red Sea (1 Kings 9:26; 22:48; 2
      Chr. 9:21). Some, again, argue that Carthage was the place
      so named. There can be little doubt, however, that this is
      the name of a Phoenician port in Spain, between the two
      mouths of the Guadalquivir (the name given to the river by
      the Arabs, and meaning &quot;the great wady&quot; or
      water-course). It was founded by a Carthaginian colony, and
      was the farthest western harbour of Tyrian sailors. It was
      to this port Jonah&#39;s ship was about to sail from Joppa.
      It has well been styled &quot;the Peru of Tyrian
      adventure;&quot; it abounded in gold and silver mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that this name also is used without reference to
      any locality. &quot;Ships of Tarshish&quot; is an
      expression sometimes denoting simply ships intended for a
      long voyage (Isa. 23:1, 14), ships of a large size
      (sea-going ships), whatever might be the port to which they
      sailed. Solomon&#39;s ships were so styled (1 Kings 10:22;
      22:49).

      designed for the reception of travellers, as the name
      indicates. Here Paul, on his way to Rome, was met by a band
      of Roman Christians (Acts 28:15). The &quot;Tres Tabernae
      was the first mansio or mutatio, that is, halting-place for
      relays, from Rome, or the last on the way to the city. At
      this point three roads run into the Via Appia, that from
      Tusculum, that from Alba Longa, and that from Antium; so
      necessarily here would be a halting-place, which took its
      name from the three shops there, the general store, the
      blacksmith&#39;s, and the refreshment-house...Tres Tabernae
      is translated as Three Taverns, but it more correctly means

      faithfully observed for many generations (2 Chr. 24:6;
      Matt. 17:24).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when the people had kings to reign over them,
      they began, as Samuel had warned them (1 Sam. 8:10-18), to
      pay taxes for civil purposes (1 Kings 4:7; 9:15; 12:4).
      Such taxes, in increased amount, were afterwards paid to
      the foreign princes that ruled over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament the payment of taxes, imposed by
      lawful rulers, is enjoined as a duty (Rom. 13:1-7; 1 Pet.
      2:13, 14). Mention is made of the tax (telos) on
      merchandise and travellers (Matt. 17:25); the annual tax
      (phoros) on property (Luke 20:22; 23:2); the poll-tax
      (kensos, &quot;tribute,&quot; Matt. 17:25; 22:17; Mark
      12:14); and the temple-tax (&quot;tribute money&quot; = two
      drachmas = half shekel, Matt. 17:24-27; comp. Ex. 30:13).

      enrolment of them with a view to their taxation. The decree
      for the enrolment was the occasion of Joseph and Mary&#39;s
      going up to Bethlehem. It has been argued by some that
      Cyrenius (q.v.) was governor of Cilicia and Syria both at
      the time of our Lord&#39;s birth and some years afterwards.
      This decree for the taxing referred to the whole Roman
