      21). Believers are called &quot;the temple of God&quot; (1
      Cor. 3:16, 17). The Church is designated &quot;an holy
      temple in the Lord&quot; (Eph. 2:21). Heaven is also called
      a temple (Rev. 7:5). We read also of the heathen
      &quot;temple of the great goddess Diana&quot; (Acts
      19:27).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This word is generally used in Scripture of the sacred
      house erected on the summit of Mount Moriah for the worship
      of God. It is called &quot;the temple&quot; (1 Kings 6:17);
      &quot;the temple [R.V., &#39;house&#39;] of the Lord&quot;
      (2 Kings 11:10); &quot;thy holy temple&quot; (Ps. 79:1);

      <a name="T0003611"><b>Temple, Herod&#39;s -</b> The temple
      erected by the exiles on their return from Babylon had
      stood for about five hundred years, when Herod the Great
      became king of Judea. The building had suffered
      considerably from natural decay as well as from the
      assaults of hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining
      the favour of the Jews, proposed to rebuild it. This offer
      was accepted, and the work was begun (B.C. 18), and carried
      out at great labour and expense, and on a scale of
      surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was
      completed in ten years, but the erection of the outer
      courts and the embellishment of the whole were carried on
      during the entire period of our Lord&#39;s life on earth
      (John 2:16, 19-21), and the temple was completed only A.D.
      65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty
      years after our Lord&#39;s crucifixion, his prediction of
      its overthrow was accomplished (Luke 19: 41-44). The Roman
      legions took the city of Jerusalem by storm, and
      notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made to
      preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several
      places, and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was
      never rebuilt.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Several remains of Herod&#39;s stately temple have by
      recent explorations been brought to light. It had two
      courts, one intended for the Israelites only, and the
      other, a large outer court, called &quot;the court of the
      Gentiles,&quot; intended for the use of strangers of all
      nations. These two courts were separated by a low wall, as
      Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet high, with thirteen
      openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, at regular
      intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek an
      inscription to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain
      of death, to pass from the court of the Gentiles into that
      of the Jews. At the entrance to a graveyard at the
      north-western angle of the Haram wall, a stone was
      discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871, built into the wall,
      bearing the following inscription in Greek capitals:
      &quot;No stranger is to enter within the partition wall and
      enclosure around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught will be
      responsible to himself for his death, which will
      ensue.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that the stone thus discovered was
      one of those originally placed on the boundary wall which
      separated the Jews from the Gentiles, of which Josephus
      speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of importance to notice that the word rendered
      &quot;sanctuary&quot; in the inscription was used in a
      specific sense of the inner court, the court of the
      Israelites, and is the word rendered &quot;temple&quot; in
      John 2:15 and Acts 21:28, 29. When Paul speaks of the
      middle wall of partition (Eph. 2:14), he probably makes
      allusion to this dividing wall. Within this partition wall
      stood the temple proper, consisting of, (1) the court of
      the women, 8 feet higher than the outer court; (2) 10 feet
      higher than this court was the court of Israel; (3) the
      court of the priests, again 3 feet higher; and lastly (4)
      the temple floor, 8 feet above that; thus in all 29 feet
      above the level of the outer court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summit of Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood, is
      now occupied by the Haram esh-Sherif, i.e., &quot;the
      sacred enclosure.&quot; This enclosure is about 1,500 feet
      from north to south, with a breadth of about 1,000 feet,
      covering in all a space of about 35 acres. About the centre
      of the enclosure is a raised platform, 16 feet above the
      surrounding space, and paved with large stone slabs, on
      which stands the Mohammedan mosque called Kubbet es-Sahkra
      i.e., the &quot;Dome of the Rock,&quot; or the Mosque of
      Omar. This mosque covers the site of Solomon&#39;s temple.
      In the centre of the dome there is a bare, projecting rock,
      the highest part of Moriah (q.v.), measuring 60 feet by 40,
      standing 6 feet above the floor of the mosque, called the
      sahkra, i.e., &quot;rock.&quot; Over this rock the altar of
      burnt-offerings stood. It was the threshing-floor of
      Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position on this
      &quot;sacred enclosure&quot; which the temple occupied has
      not been yet definitely ascertained. Some affirm that
      Herod&#39;s temple covered the site of Solomon&#39;s temple
      and palace, and in addition enclosed a square of 300 feet
      at the south-western angle. The temple courts thus are
      supposed to have occupied the southern portion of the
      &quot;enclosure,&quot; forming in all a square of more than
      900 feet. It is argued by others that Herod&#39;s temple
      occupied a square of 600 feet at the south-west of the
      &quot;enclosure.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003612"><b>Temple, Solomon&#39;s -</b> Before
      his death David had &quot;with all his might&quot; provided
      materials in great abundance for the building of the temple
      on the summit of Mount Moriah (1 Chr. 22:14; 29:4; 2 Chr.
      3:1), on the east of the city, on the spot where Abraham
      had offered up Isaac (Gen. 22:1-14). In the beginning of
      his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire
      that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and
      prepared additional materials for the building. From
      subterranean quarries at Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks
      of stone for the foundations and walls of the temple. These
      stones were prepared for their places in the building under
      the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a
      compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of
      whatever else was needed for the work, particularly timber
      from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in great
      rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to
      Jerusalem (1 Kings 5). As the hill on which the temple was
      to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge
      wall of solid masonry of great height, in some places more
      than 200 feet high, was raised across the south of the
      hill, and a similar wall on the eastern side, and in the
      spaces between were erected many arches and pillars, thus
      raising up the general surface to the required level.
      Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the
      temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into
      which water was conveyed by channels from the
      &quot;pools&quot; near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns,
      the &quot;great sea,&quot; was capable of containing three
      millions of gallons. The overflow was led off by a conduit
      to the Kidron.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these preparatory undertakings a space of about
      three years was occupied; and now the process of the
      erection of the great building began, under the direction
      of skilled Phoenician builders and workmen, in the fourth
      year of Solomon&#39;s reign, 480 years after the Exodus (1
      Kings 6; 2 Chr. 3). Many thousands of labourers and skilled
      artisans were employed in the work. Stones prepared in the
      quarries underneath the city (1 Kings 5:17, 18) of huge
      dimension (see QUARRIES &macr;T0003032) were gradually
      placed on the massive walls, and closely fitted together
      without any mortar between, till the whole structure was
      completed. No sound of hammer or axe or any tool of iron
      was heard as the structure arose (6:7). &quot;Like some
      tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang.&quot; The building
      was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. The
      engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in their
      explorations around the temple area, discovered what is
      believed to have been the &quot;chief corner stone&quot; of
      the temple, &quot;the most interesting stone in the
      world.&quot; It lies at the bottom of the south-eastern
      angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14 feet long. It
      rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inches
      below the present surface. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002900.html&amp;from=T0002957&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      PINNACLE</a>.) In examining the walls the engineers were
      &quot;struck with admiration at the vastness of the blocks
      and the general excellence of the workmanship.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in the autumn of the eleventh year of his reign,
      seven and a half years after it had been begun, the temple
      was completed in all its architectural magnificence and
      beauty. For thirteen years there it stood, on the summit of
      Moriah, silent and unused. The reasons for this strange
      delay in its consecration are unknown. At the close of
      these thirteen years preparations for the dedication of the
      temple were made on a scale of the greatest magnificence.
      The ark was solemnly brought from the tent in which David
      had deposited it to the place prepared for it in the
      temple, and the glory-cloud, the symbol of the divine
      presence, filled the house. Then Solomon ascended a
      platform which had been erected for him, in the sight of
      all the people, and lifting up his hands to heaven poured
      out his heart to God in prayer (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6, 7).
      The feast of dedication, which lasted seven days, followed
      by the feast of tabernacles, marked a new era in the
      history of Israel. On the eighth day of the feast of
      tabernacles, Solomon dismissed the vast assemblage of the
      people, who returned to their homes filled with joy and
      gladness, &quot;Had Solomon done no other service beyond
      the building of the temple, he would still have influenced
      the religious life of his people down to the latest days.
      It was to them a perpetual reminder and visible symbol of
      God&#39;s presence and protection, a strong bulwark of all
      the sacred traditions of the law, a witness to duty, an
      impulse to historic study, an inspiration of sacred
      song.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The temple consisted of, (1.) The oracle or most holy place
      (1 Kings 6:19; 8:6), called also the &quot;inner
      house&quot; (6:27), and the &quot;holiest of all&quot;
      (Heb. 9:3). It was 20 cubits in length, breadth, and
      height. It was floored and wainscotted with cedar (1 Kings
      6:16), and its walls and floor were overlaid with gold
      (6:20, 21, 30). There was a two-leaved door between it and
      the holy place overlaid with gold (2 Chr. 4:22); also a
      veil of blue purple and crimson and fine linen (2 Chr.
      3:14; comp. Ex. 26:33). It had no windows (1 Kings 8:12).
      It was indeed the dwelling-place of God. (2.) The holy
      place (q.v.), 1 Kings 8:8-10, called also the &quot;greater
      house&quot; (2 Chr. 3:5) and the &quot;temple&quot; (1
      Kings 6:17). (3.) The porch or entrance before the temple
      on the east (1 Kings 6:3; 2 Chr. 3:4; 29:7). In the porch
      stood the two pillars Jachin and Boaz (1 Kings 7:21; 2
      Kings 11:14; 23:3). (4.) The chambers, which were built
      about the temple on the southern, western, and northern
      sides (1 Kings 6:5-10). These formed a part of the
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round about the building were, (1.) The court of the
      priests (2 Chr. 4:9), called the &quot;inner court&quot; (1
      Kings 6:36). It contained the altar of burnt-offering (2
      Chr. 15:8), the brazen sea (4:2-5, 10), and ten lavers (1
      Kings 7:38, 39). (2.) The great court, which surrounded the
      whole temple (2 Chr. 4:9). Here the people assembled to
      worship God (Jer. 19:14; 26:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      This temple erected by Solomon was many times pillaged
      during the course of its history, (1) 1 Kings 14:25, 26;
      (2) 2 Kings 14:14; (3) 2 Kings 16:8, 17, 18; (4) 2 Kings
      18:15, 16. At last it was pillaged and destroyed by
      Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 24:13; 2 Chr. 36:7). He burned the
      temple, and carried all its treasures with him to Babylon
      (2 Kings 25:9-17; 2 Chr. 36:19; Isa. 64:11). These sacred
      vessels were at length, at the close of the Captivity,
      restored to the Jews by Cyrus (Ezra 1:7-11).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003613"><b>Temple, the Second -</b> After the
      return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high
      priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made to
      reorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of
      pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, including children,
      having completed the long and dreary journey of some four
      months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were
      animated in all their proceeding by a strong religious
      impulse, and therefore one of their first cares was to
      restore their ancient worship by rebuilding the temple. On
      the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them
      a remarkable example of liberality by contributing
      personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about $6,000),
      besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasm
      poured their gifts into the sacred treasury (Ezra 2). First
      they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the
      exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then
      cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the
      site of the old temple; and in the second month of the
      second year (B.C. 535), amid great public excitement and
      rejoicing (Ps. 116; 117; 118), the foundations of the
      second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this
      great movement, although it was regarded with mingled
      feelings by the spectators (Hag. 2:3; Zech. 4:10). The
      Samaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work.
      Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all
      such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help.
      Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews.
      The Samaritans sought to &quot;frustrate their
      purpose&quot; (Ezra 4:5), and sent messengers to Ecbatana
      and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.
      Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having
      killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to
      the east, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses (B.C.
      529-522), on whose death the &quot;false Smerdis,&quot; an
      imposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight
      months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522).
      In the second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding
      the temple was resumed and carried forward to its
      completion (Ezra 5: 6-17; 6:1-15), under the stimulus of
      the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai
      and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring
      of B.C. 516, twenty years after the return from
      captivity.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This second temple had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim,
      the holy oil, the sacred fire, the tables of stone, the pot
      of manna, and Aaron&#39;s rod. As in the tabernacle, there
      was in it only one golden lamp for the holy place, one
      table of shewbread, and the incense altar, with golden
      censers, and many of the vessels of gold that had belonged
      to Solomon&#39;s temple that had been carried to Babylon
      but restored by Cyrus (Ezra 1:7-11).
    </p>
    <p>
      This second temple also differed from the first in that,
      while in the latter there were numerous &quot;trees planted
      in the courts of the Lord,&quot; there were none in the
      former. The second temple also had for the first time a
      space, being a part of the outer court, provided for
      proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah, although not
      subject to the laws of Judaism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temple, when completed, was consecrated amid great
      rejoicings on the part of all the people (Ezra 6:16),
      although there were not wanting outward evidences that the
      Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject
      to a foreign power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hag. 2:9 is rightly rendered in the Revised Version,
      &quot;The latter glory of this house shall be greater than
      the former,&quot; instead of, &quot;The glory of this
      latter house,&quot; etc., in the Authorized Version. The
      temple, during the different periods of its existence, is
      regarded as but one house, the one only house of God (comp.
      2:3). The glory here predicted is spiritual glory and not
      material splendour. &quot;Christ himself, present bodily in
      the temple on Mount Zion during his life on earth, present
      spiritually in the Church now, present in the holy city,
      the heavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling
      forth spiritual worship and devotion is the glory here
      predicted&quot; (Perowne).

      <a name="T0003614"><b>Temptation -</b> (1.) Trial; a being
      put to the test. Thus God &quot;tempted [Gen. 22: 1; R.V.,
      &#39;did prove&#39;] Abraham;&quot; and afflictions are
      said to tempt, i.e., to try, men (James 1:2, 12; comp.
      Deut. 8:2), putting their faith and patience to the test.
      (2.) Ordinarily, however, the word means solicitation to
      that which is evil, and hence Satan is called &quot;the
      tempter&quot; (Matt. 4:3). Our Lord was in this way tempted
      in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by
      a real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It
      was submitted to as an act of obedience on his part.
      &quot;Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore
      him a certain violence is implied in the words&quot; (Matt.
      4:1-11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of the temptation of our Lord is generally
      supposed to have been the mountain of Quarantania (q.v.),
      &quot;a high and precipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500
      feet above the plain west of Jordan, near Jericho.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Temptation is common to all (Dan. 12:10; Zech. 13:9; Ps.
      66:10; Luke 22:31, 40; Heb. 11:17; James 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:7;
      4:12). We read of the temptation of Joseph (Gen. 39), of
      David (2 Sam. 24; 1 Chr. 21), of Hezekiah (2 Chr. 32:31),
      of Daniel (Dan. 6), etc. So long as we are in this world we
      are exposed to temptations, and need ever to be on our
      watch against them.

      <a name="T0003615"><b>Tent -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;ohel (Gen.
      9:21, 27). This word is used also of a dwelling or
      habitation (1 Kings 8:66; Isa. 16:5; Jer. 4:20), and of the
      temple (Ezek. 41:1). When used of the tabernacle, as in 1
      Kings 1:39, it denotes the covering of goat&#39;s hair
      which was placed over the mishcan.</a>
    </p>
    <p>

      temple (Ps. 46:4; 84:2; 132:5), and of the tabernacle (Ex.
      25:9; 26:1; 40:9; Num. 1:50, 53; 10:11). When distinguished
      from &#39;ohel, it denotes the twelve interior curtains
      which lay upon the framework of the tabernacle (q.v.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. kubbah (Num. 25:8), a dome-like tent devoted to
      the impure worship of Baal-peor.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. succah (2 Sam. 11:11), a tent or booth made of
      green boughs or branches (see Gen. 33:17; Lev. 23:34, 42;
      Ps. 18:11; Jonah 4:5; Isa. 4:6; Neh. 8:15-17, where the
      word is variously rendered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jubal was &quot;the father of such as dwell in tents&quot;
      (Gen. 4:20). The patriarchs were &quot;dwellers in
      tents&quot; (Gen. 9:21, 27; 12:8; 13:12; 26:17); and during
      their wilderness wanderings all Israel dwelt in tents (Ex.
      16:16; Deut. 33:18; Josh. 7:24). Tents have always occupied
      a prominent place in Eastern life (1 Sam. 17:54; 2 Kings
      7:7; Ps. 120:5; Cant. 1:5). Paul the apostle&#39;s
      occupation was that of a tent-maker (Acts 18:3); i.e.,
      perhaps a maker of tent cloth.

      was required to bring a trespass, a sin, and a burnt
      offering, and to present a meal offering, a tenth deal or
      an omer of flour for each, with oil to make it into bread

      He had three sons, Haran, Nahor, and Abraham, and one
      daughter, Sarah. He settled in &quot;Ur of the
      Chaldees,&quot; where his son Haran died, leaving behind
      him his son Lot. Nahor settled at Haran, a place on the way
      to Ur. Terah afterwards migrated with Abraham (probably his
      youngest son) and Lot (his grandson), together with their
      families, from Ur, intending to go with them to Canaan; but
      he tarried at Haran, where he spent the remainder of his
      days, and died at the age of two hundred and five years
      (Gen. 11:24-32; Josh. 24:2). What a wonderful part the

      <a name="T0003618"><b>Teraphim -</b> givers of prosperity,
      idols in human shape, large or small, analogous to the
      images of ancestors which were revered by the Romans. In
      order to deceive the guards sent by Saul to seize David,
      Michal his wife prepared one of the household teraphim,
      putting on it the goat&#39;s-hair cap worn by sleepers and
      invalids, and laid it in a bed, covering it with a mantle.
      She pointed it out to the soldiers, and alleged that David
      was confined to his bed by a sudden illness (1 Sam.
      19:13-16). Thus she gained time for David&#39;s escape. It
      seems strange to read of teraphim, images of ancestors,
      preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of
      David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal
      from her father&#39;s house. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; says
      Bishop Wordsworth, &quot;Saul, forsaken by God and
      possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to teraphim (as
      he afterwards resorted to witchcraft); and God overruled
      evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of
      his own daughter) to be an instrument for David&#39;s
      escape.&quot;, Deane&#39;s David, p. 32. Josiah attempted
      to suppress this form of idolatry (2 Kings 23:24). The
      ephod and teraphim are mentioned together in Hos. 3:4. It
      has been supposed by some (Cheyne&#39;s Hosea) that the
      &quot;ephod&quot; here mentioned, and also in Judg.
      8:24-27, was not the part of the sacerdotal dress so called
      (Ex. 28:6-14), but an image of Jehovah overlaid with gold
      or silver (comp. Judg. 17, 18; 1 Sam. 21:9; 23:6, 9; 30:7,
      8), and is thus associated with the teraphim. (See <a href=

      were the servants of Jehovah, who ruled over their public

      The first epistle to the Thessalonians was the first of all
      Paul&#39;s epistles. It was in all probability written from
      Corinth, where he abode a &quot;long time&quot; (Acts
      18:11, 18), early in the period of his residence there,
      about the end of A.D. 52.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion of its being written was the return of
      Timotheus from Macedonia, bearing tidings from Thessalonica
      regarding the state of the church there (Acts 18:1-5; 1
      Thess. 3:6). While, on the whole, the report of Timothy was
      encouraging, it also showed that divers errors and
      misunderstandings regarding the tenor of Paul&#39;s
      teaching had crept in amongst them. He addresses them in
      this letter with the view of correcting these errors, and
      especially for the purpose of exhorting them to purity of
      life, reminding them that their sanctification was the
      great end desired by God regarding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subscription erroneously states that this epistle was
      written from Athens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably also
      written from Corinth, and not many months after the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion of the writing of this epistle was the arrival
      of tidings that the tenor of the first epistle had been
      misunderstood, especially with reference to the second
      advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea
      that Paul had taught that &quot;the day of Christ was at
      hand&quot;, that Christ&#39;s coming was just about to
      happen. This error is corrected (2:1-12), and the apostle
      prophetically announces what first must take place.
      &quot;The apostasy&quot; was first to arise. Various
      explanations of this expression have been given, but that
      which is most satisfactory refers it to the Church of Rome.

      <a name="T0003636"><b>Thessalonica -</b> a large and
      populous city on the Thermaic bay. It was the capital of
      one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled
      by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of
      Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her
      father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the
      day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his
      second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue
      here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of
      Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church (Acts
      17:1-4; 1 Thes. 1:9). The violence of the Jews drove him
      from the city, when he fled to Berea (Acts 17:5-10). The
      &quot;rulers of the city&quot; before whom the Jews
      &quot;drew Jason,&quot; with whom Paul and Silas lodged,
      are in the original called politarchai, an unusual word,
      which was found, however, inscribed on an arch in
      Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the accuracy of the
      historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent
      occasion (20:1-3). This city long retained its importance.
      It is the most important town of European Turkey, under the
      name of Saloniki, with a mixed population of about
      85,000.</a>

      to by Gamaliel in his speech before the council at
      Jerusalem (Acts 5:36). He headed an insurrection against
      the Roman authority. Beyond this nothing is known of
      him.</a>

      as a rapacious usurer, accumulating the wealth that
      belonged to others.</a>

      <a name="T0003639"><b>Thieves, The two -</b> (Luke 23:32,
      39-43), robbers, rather brigands, probably followers of
      Barabbas. Our Lord&#39;s cross was placed between those of
      the &quot;malefactors,&quot; to add to the ignominy of his
      position. According to tradition, Demas or Dismas was the
      name of the penitent thief hanging on the right, and Gestas
      of the impenitent on the left.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003640"><b>Thistle -</b> (1.) Heb. hoah (2 Kings
      14:9; Job 31:40). In Job 41:2 the Hebrew word is rendered
      &quot;thorn,&quot; but in the Revised Version
      &quot;hook.&quot; It is also rendered &quot;thorn&quot; in
      2 Chr. 33:11; Prov. 26:9; Cant. 2:2; &quot;brambles&quot;
      in Isa. 34:13. It is supposed to be a variety of the wild
      plum-tree, but by some it is regarded as the common
      thistle, of which there are many varieties in
      Palestine.</a>

    <p>
      (2.) Heb. dardar, meaning &quot;a plant growing
      luxuriantly&quot; (Gen. 3:18; Hos. 10:8); Gr. tribolos,
      &quot;a triple point&quot; (Matt. 7:16; Heb. 6:8,
      &quot;brier,&quot; R.V. &quot;thistle&quot;). This was
      probably the star-thistle, called by botanists Centaurea
      calcitropa, or &quot;caltrops,&quot; a weed common in
      corn-fields. (See <a href=

    <p>
      <a name="T0003641"><b>Thomas -</b> twin, one of the twelve
      (Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18, etc.). He was also called Didymus
      (John 11:16; 20:24), which is the Greek equivalent of the
      Hebrew name. All we know regarding him is recorded in the
      fourth Gospel (John 11:15, 16; 14:4, 5; 20:24, 25, 26-29).
      From the circumstance that in the lists of the apostles he
      is always mentioned along with Matthew, who was the son of
      Alphaeus (Mark 3:18), and that these two are always
      followed by James, who was also the son of Alphaeus, it has
      been supposed that these three, Matthew, Thomas, and James,
      were brothers.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003642"><b>Thorn -</b> (1.) Heb. hedek (Prov.
      15:19), rendered &quot;brier&quot; in Micah 7:4. Some
      thorny plant, of the Solanum family, suitable for hedges.
      This is probably the so-called &quot;apple of Sodom,&quot;
      which grows very abundantly in the Jordan valley. &quot;It
      is a shrubby plant, from 3 to 5 feet high, with very
      branching stems, thickly clad with spines, like those of
      the English brier, with leaves very large and woolly on the
      under side, and thorny on the midriff.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. kotz (Gen. 3:18; Hos. 10:8), rendered <i>
      akantha</i> by the LXX. In the New Testament this word <i>
      akantha</i> is also rendered &quot;thorns&quot; (Matt.
      7:16; 13:7; Heb. 6:8). The word seems to denote any thorny
      or prickly plant (Jer. 12:13). It has been identified with
      the Ononis spinosa by some.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Heb. na&#39;atzutz (Isa. 7:19; 55:13). This word has
      been interpreted as denoting the Zizyphus spina Christi, or
      the jujube-tree. It is supposed by some that the crown of
      thorns placed in wanton cruelty by the Roman soldiers on
      our Saviour&#39;s brow before his crucifixion was plaited
      of branches of this tree. It overruns a great part of the
      Jordan valley. It is sometimes called the lotus-tree.
      &quot;The thorns are long and sharp and recurved, and often
      create a festering wound.&quot; It often grows to a great
      size. (See CROWN OF <a href=

      THORNS</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Heb. atad (Ps. 58:9) is rendered in the LXX. and
      Vulgate by Rhamnus, or Lycium Europoeum, a thorny shrub,
      which is common all over Palestine. From its resemblance to
      the box it is frequently called the box-thorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003643"><b>Thorn in the flesh -</b> (2 Cor.
      12:7-10). Many interpretations have been given of this
      passage. (1.) Roman Catholic writers think that it denotes
      suggestions to impiety.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Luther, Calvin, and other Reformers interpret the
      expression as denoting temptation to unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Others suppose the expression refers to &quot;a pain
      in the ear or head,&quot; epileptic fits, or, in general,
      to some severe physical infirmity, which was a hindrance to
      the apostle in his work (comp. 1 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 10:10;
      11:30; Gal. 4:13, 14; 6:17). With a great amount of
      probability, it has been alleged that his malady was defect
      of sight, consequent on the dazzling light which shone
      around him at his conversion, acute opthalmia. This would
      account for the statements in Gal. 4:14; 2 Cor. 10:10; also
      Acts 23:5, and for his generally making use of the help of
      an amanuensis (comp. Rom. 16:22, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Another view which has been maintained is that this
      &quot;thorn&quot; consisted in an infirmity of temper, to
      which he occasionally gave way, and which interfered with
      his success (comp. Acts 15:39; 23:2-5). If we consider the
      fact, &quot;which the experience of God&#39;s saints in all
      ages has conclusively established, of the difficulty of
      subduing an infirmity of temper, as well as the pain,
      remorse, and humiliation such an infirmity is wont to cause
      to those who groan under it, we may be inclined to believe
      that not the least probable hypothesis concerning the
      &#39;thorn&#39; or &#39;stake&#39; in the flesh is that the
      loving heart of the apostle bewailed as his sorest trial
      the misfortune that, by impatience in word, he had often
      wounded those for whom he would willingly have given his
      life&quot; (Lias&#39;s Second Cor., Introd.).

      name for &quot;families&quot; or &quot;clans&quot; (see
      Num. 1:16; 10:4; Josh. 22:14, 21). Several

      threshold proper (1 Sam. 5:4,5; Ezek. 9:3; 10:4,18; 46:2;

      (2.) &#39;Asuppim, pl. (Neh. 12:25), rendered correctly
      &quot;storehouses&quot; in the Revised Version. In 1 Chr.
      26:15, 17 the Authorized Version retains the word as a
      proper name, while in the Revised Version it is translated
      &quot;storehouses.&quot;

    <p>
      <a name="T0003647"><b>Throne -</b> (Heb. kiss&#39;e), a
      royal chair or seat of dignity (Deut. 17:18; 2 Sam. 7:13;
      Ps. 45:6); an elevated seat with a canopy and hangings,
      which cover it. It denotes the seat of the high priest in 1
      Sam. 1:9; 4:13, and of a provincial governor in Neh. 3:7
      and Ps. 122:5. The throne of Solomon is described at length

      Deut. 33:8; Judg. 1:1; 20:18; 1 Sam. 14:3,18; 23:9; 2 Sam.
      21:1. What the &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; were cannot be
      determined with any certainty. All we certainly know is
      that they were a certain divinely-given means by which God
      imparted, through the high priest, direction and counsel to
      Israel when these were needed. The method by which this was
      done can be only a matter of mere conjecture. They were
      apparently material objects, quite distinct from the
      breastplate, but something added to it after all the stones
      had been set in it, something in addition to the
      breastplate and its jewels. They may have been, as some
      suppose, two small images, like the teraphim (comp. Judg.
      17:5; 18:14, 17, 20; Hos. 3:4), which were kept in the bag
      of the breastplate, by which, in some unknown way, the high
      priest could give forth his divinely imparted decision when
      consulted. They were probably lost at the destruction of
      the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. They were never seen after
      the return from captivity.</a>

      <a name="T0003649"><b>Thunder -</b> often referred to in
      Scripture (Job 40:9; Ps. 77:18; 104:7). James and John were
      called by our Lord &quot;sons of thunder&quot; (Mark 3:17).
      In Job 39:19, instead of &quot;thunder,&quot; as in the
      Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates
      (ra&#39;amah) by &quot;quivering main&quot; (marg.,
      &quot;shaking&quot;). Thunder accompanied the giving of the
      law at Sinai (Ex. 19:16). It was regarded as the voice of
      God (Job 37:2; Ps. 18:13; 81:7; comp. John 12:29). In
      answer to Samuel&#39;s prayer (1 Sam. 12:17, 18), God sent
      thunder, and &quot;all the people greatly feared,&quot; for
      at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were
      almost unknown in Palestine.</a>

      on the borders of Lydia and Mysia. Its modern name is
      Ak-hissar, i.e., &quot;white castle.&quot; Here was one of
      the seven churches (Rev. 1:11; 2:18-28). Lydia, the seller
      of purple, or rather of cloth dyed with this colour, was
      from this city (Acts 16:14). It was and still is famous for
      its dyeing. Among the ruins, inscriptions have been found
      relating to the guild of dyers in that city in ancient
      times.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003651"><b>Thyine wood -</b> mentioned only in
      Rev. 18:12 among the articles which would cease to be
      purchased when Babylon fell. It was called citrus, citron
      wood, by the Romans. It was the Callitris quadrivalvis of
      botanists, of the cone-bearing order of trees, and of the
      cypress tribe of this order. The name of this wood is
      derived from the Greek word <i>thuein</i>, &quot;to
      sacrifice,&quot; and it was so called because it was burnt
      in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance. The wood of
      this tree was reckoned very valuable, and was used for
      making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Like
      the cedars of Lebanon, it is disappearing from the forests
      of Palestine.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003652"><b>Tiberias -</b> a city, the modern
      Tubarich, on the western shore of the Sea of Tiberias. It
      is said to have been founded by Herod Antipas (A.D. 16), on
      the site of the ruins of an older city called Rakkath, and
      to have been thus named by him after the Emperor Tiberius.
      It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord
      (John 6:1,23; 21:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants perished by an
      earthquake. The population of the city is now about six
      thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. &quot;We do not
      read that our Lord ever entered this city. The reason of
      this is probably to be found in the fact that it was
      practically a heathen city, though standing upon Jewish
      soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of
      Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of
      Asia. There were in it a theatre for the performance of
      comedies, a forum, a stadium, a palace roofed with gold in
      imitation of those in Italy, statues of the Roman gods, and
      busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but to
      the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold
      himself aloof from such scenes as these&quot;
      (Manning&#39;s Those Holy Fields).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one
      of the chief residences of the Jews in Palestine. It was
      for more than three hundred years their metropolis. From
      about A.D. 150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and established
      rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the
      Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the
      beginning of the fifth century. To this same rabbinical
      school also we are indebted for the Masora, a &quot;body of
      traditions which transmitted the readings of the Hebrew
      text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the
      vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew.&quot; In its
      original form, and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is
      written without vowels; hence, when it ceased to be a
      spoken language, the importance of knowing what vowels to
      insert between the consonants. This is supplied by the
      Masora, and hence these vowels are called the
      &quot;Masoretic vowel-points.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003653"><b>Tiberias, Sea of -</b> called also
      the Sea of Galilee (q.v.) and of Gennesaret. In the Old
      Testament it is called the Sea of Chinnereth or Chinneroth.
      John (21:1) is the only evangelist who so designates this
      lake. His doing so incidentally confirms the opinion that
      he wrote after the other evangelists, and at a period
      subsequent to the taking of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). Tiberias
      had by this time become an important city, having been
      spared by the Romans, and made the capital of the province
      when Jerusalem was destroyed. It thus naturally gave its
      name to the lake.</a>

      on the throne, A.D. 14. He was noted for his vicious and
      infamous life. In the fifteenth year of his reign John the
      Baptist entered on his public ministry, and under him also
      our Lord taught and suffered. He died A.D. 37. He is
      frequently referred to simply as &quot;Caesar&quot; (Matt.

      He appears in the Assyrian records as gaining, in the fifth
      year of his reign (about B.C. 741), a victory over Azariah
      (= Uzziah in 2 Chr.26:1), king of Judah, whose achievements
      are described in 2 Chr. 26:6-15. He is first mentioned in
      Scripture, however, as gaining a victory over Pekah, king
      of Israel, and Rezin of Damascus, who were confederates. He
      put Rezin to death, and punished Pekah by taking a
      considerable portion of his kingdom, and carrying off (B.C.
      734) a vast number of its inhabitants into captivity (2
      Kings 15:29; 16:5-9; 1 Chr. 5:6, 26), the Reubenites, the
      Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh whom he settled in
      Gozan. In the Assyrian annals it is further related that,
      before he returned from Syria, he held a court at Damascus,
      and received submission and tribute from the neighbouring
      kings, among whom were Pekah of Samaria and
      &quot;Yahu-khazi [i.e., Ahaz], king of Judah&quot; (comp. 2

      disciple who was Paul&#39;s companion in many of his
      journeyings. His mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois,
      are mentioned as eminent for their piety (2 Tim. 1:5). We
      know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek (Acts
      16:1). He is first brought into notice at the time of
      Paul&#39;s second visit to Lystra (16:2), where he probably
      resided, and where it seems he was converted during
      Paul&#39;s first visit to that place (1 Tim. 1:2; 2 Tim.
      3:11). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his
      &quot;own son in the faith,&quot; arranged that he should
      become his companion (Acts 16:3), and took and circumcised
      him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was
      designated to the office of an evangelist (1 Tim. 4:14),
      and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia,
      and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea (Acts
      17:14). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by
      him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (17:15; 1
      Thess. 3:2). We next find him at Corinth (1 Thess. 1:1; 2
      Thess. 1:1) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few
      years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus
      (Acts 19:22), whence he is sent on a mission into
      Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia (20:4),
      where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a
      prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him (Phil. 1:1), where it
      appears he also suffered imprisonment (Heb. 13:23). During
      the apostle&#39;s second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy,
      asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring
      with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his
      cloak and parchments (2 Tim. 4:13). According to tradition,
      after the apostle&#39;s death he settled in Ephesus as his
      sphere of labour, and there found a martyr&#39;s grave.</a>

      in this epistle speaks of himself as having left Ephesus
      for Macedonia (1:3), and hence not Laodicea, as mentioned
      in the subscription; but probably Philippi, or some other
      city in that region, was the place where this epistle was
      written. During the interval between his first and second
      imprisonments he probably visited the scenes of his former
      labours in Greece and Asia, and then found his way into
      Macedonia, whence he wrote this letter to Timothy, whom he
      had left behind in Ephesus.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably written about A.D. 66 or 67.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epistle consists mainly, (1) of counsels to Timothy
      regarding the worship and organization of the Church, and
      the responsibilities resting on its several members; and
      (2) of exhortation to faithfulness in maintaining the truth
      amid surrounding errors.

      probably written a year or so after the first, and from
      Rome, where Paul was for a second time a prisoner, and was
      sent to Timothy by the hands of Tychicus. In it he entreats
      Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark
      with him (comp. Phil. 2:22). He was anticipating that
      &quot;the time of his departure was at hand&quot; (2 Tim.
      4:6), and he exhorts his &quot;son Timothy&quot; to all
      diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under
      persecution (1:6-15), and to a faithful discharge of all
      the duties of his office (4:1-5), with all the solemnity of

      is the general opinion that the Phoenicians of Tyre and
      Sidon obtained their supplies of tin from the British
      Isles. In Ezek. 27:12 it is said to have been brought from
      Tarshish, which was probably a commercial emporium supplied
      with commodities from other places. In Isa. 1:25 the word
      so rendered is generally understood of lead, the alloy with
      which the silver had become mixed (ver. 22). The fire of
      the Babylonish Captivity would be the means of purging out
      the idolatrous alloy that had corrupted the people.</a>

      on the western bank of the Euphrates,&quot; about 100 miles
      north-east of Tadmor. All the land traffic between the east
      and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an
      expedition against this city, and &quot;smote Tiphsah and
      all that were therein&quot; (2 Kings 15:16). This
      expedition implied a march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if
      by way of Tadmor, and about 400 if by way of Aleppo; and
      its success showed the strength of the Israelite kingdom,
      for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder,
      however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6
      miles west of Shechem.</a>

      head (Ezek. 24:17; R.V., &quot;headtire;&quot; 24:23). In

      Ethiopia (2 Kings 19:9; Isa. 37:9), which with Egypt now
      formed one nation. He was a great warrior, and but little
      is known of him. The Assyrian armies under Esarhaddon, and
      again under Assur-bani-pal, invaded Egypt and defeated

      removed to it from Shechem, which at first he made the
      capital of his kingdom. It remained the chief residence of
      the kings of Israel till Omri took Samaria (1 Kings 14:17;
      15:21; 16:6, 8, etc.). Here Zimri perished amid the flames

      Kings 16:18), and here Menahem smote Shallum (2 Kings
      15:14, 16). Solomon refers to its beauty (Cant. 6:4). It
      has been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11

      the word rendered &quot;inhabitants&quot; is in the
      original the same as that rendered &quot;Tishbite,&quot;
      hence that verse may be read as in the LXX., &quot;Elijah
      the Tishbite of Tishbi in Gilead.&quot; Some interpret this
      word as meaning &quot;stranger,&quot; and read the verse,
      &quot;Elijah the stranger from among the strangers in
      Gilead.&quot; This designation is probably given to the
      prophet as denoting that his birthplace was Tishbi, a place
      in Upper Galilee (mentioned in the apocryphal book of
      Tobit), from which for some reason he migrated into Gilead.
      Josephus, the Jewish historian (Ant. 8:13, 2), however,
      supposes that Tishbi was some place in the land of Gilead.
      It has been identified by some with el-Ishtib, a some place
      22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among the
      mountains of Gilead.</a>

      <a name="T0003681"><b>Tithe -</b> a tenth of the produce of
      the earth consecrated and set apart for special purposes.
      The dedication of a tenth to God was recognized as a duty
      before the time of Moses. Abraham paid tithes to
      Melchizedek (Gen. 14:20; Heb. 7:6); and Jacob vowed unto
      the Lord and said, &quot;Of all that thou shalt give me I
      will surely give the tenth unto thee.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Mosaic law on this subject is recorded in Lev.
      27:30-32. Subsequent legislation regulated the destination
      of the tithes (Num. 18:21-24, 26-28; Deut. 12:5, 6, 11, 17;
      14:22, 23). The paying of the tithes was an important part
      of the Jewish religious worship. In the days of Hezekiah
      one of the first results of the reformation of religion was
      the eagerness with which the people brought in their tithes
      (2 Chr. 31:5, 6). The neglect of this duty was sternly
      rebuked by the prophets (Amos 4:4; Mal. 3:8-10). It cannot
      be affirmed that the Old Testament law of tithes is binding
      on the Christian Church, nevertheless the principle of this
      law remains, and is incorporated in the gospel (1 Cor.
      9:13, 14); and if, as is the case, the motive that ought to
      prompt to liberality in the cause of religion and of the
      service of God be greater now than in Old Testament times,
      then Christians outght to go beyond the ancient Hebrew in
      consecrating both themselves and their substance to God.

    <p>
      Every Jew was required by the Levitical law to pay three
      tithes of his property (1) one tithe for the Levites; (2)
      one for the use of the temple and the great feasts; and (3)
      one for the poor of the land.

      and Barnabas at Antioch, and accompanied them to the
      council at Jerusalem (Gal. 2:1-3; Acts 15:2), although his
      name nowhere occurs in the Acts of the Apostles. He appears
      to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in
      ministering to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have
      him circumcised, inasmuch as in his case the cause of
      gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at a later
      period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was
      sent by Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the
      contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor
      saints at Jerusalem sent forward (2 Cor. 8:6; 12:18). He
      rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered
      him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (7:6-15).
      After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul&#39;s
      first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the
      organization of the church in Crete, where the apostle had
      left him for this purpose (Titus 1:5). The last notice of
      him is in 2 Tim. 4:10, where we find him with Paul at Rome
      during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into
      Dalmatia, no doubt on some important missionary errand. We
      have no record of his death. He is not mentioned in the
      Acts.</a>

      <a name="T0003684"><b>Titus, Epistle to -</b> was probably
      written about the same time as the first epistle to
      Timothy, with which it has many affinities. &quot;Both
      letters were addressed to persons left by the writer to
      preside in their respective churches during his absence.
      Both letters are principally occupied in describing the
      qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should
      appoint to offices in the church; and the ingredients of
      this description are in both letters nearly the same.
      Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same
      prevailing corruptions, and in particular against the same
      misdirection of their cares and studies. This affinity
      obtains not only in the subject of the letters, which from
      the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they
      were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but
      extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and
      expressions. The writer accosts his two friends with the
      same salutation, and passes on to the business of his
      letter by the same transition (comp. 1 Tim. 1:2, 3 with
      Titus 1:4, 5; 1 Tim.1:4 with Titus 1:13, 14; 3:9; 1 Tim.
      4:12 with Titus 2:7, 15).&quot;, Paley&#39;s Horae
      Paulinae.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The date of its composition may be concluded from the
      circumstance that it was written after Paul&#39;s visit to
      Crete (Titus 1:5). That visit could not be the one referred
      to in Acts 27:7, when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a
      prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years.
      We may warrantably suppose that after his release Paul
      sailed from Rome into Asia and took Crete by the way, and
      that there he left Titus &quot;to set in order the things
      that were wanting.&quot; Thence he went to Ephesus, where
      he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to Macedonia, where he
      wrote First Timothy, and thence to Nicopolis in Epirus,
      from which place he wrote to Titus, about A.D. 66 or 67.

      <a name="T0003697"><b>Tombs -</b> of the Hebrews were
      generally excavated in the solid rock, or were natural
      caves. Mention is made of such tombs in Judg. 8:32; 2 Sam.
      2:32; 2 Kings 9:28; 23:30. They were sometimes made in
      gardens (2 Kings 21:26; 23:16; Matt. 27:60). They are found
      in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the
      land. They were sometimes whitewashed (Matt. 23:27, 29).
      The body of Jesus was laid in Joseph&#39;s new rock-hewn
      tomb, in a garden near to Calvary. All evidence is in
      favour of the opinion that this tomb was somewhere near the
      Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be
      identified with the so-called &quot;holy sepulchre.&quot;
      The mouth of such rocky tombs was usually closed by a large
      stone (Heb. golal), which could only be removed by the
      united efforts of several men (Matt. 28:2; comp. John
      11:39). (See <a href=

      <a name="T0003699"><b>Tongues, Gift of -</b> granted on the
      day of Pentecost (Acts 2:4), in fulfilment of a promise
      Christ had made to his disciples (Mark 16:17). What this
      gift actually was has been a subject of much discussion.
      Some have argued that it was merely an outward sign of the
      presence of the Holy Spirit among the disciples, typifying
      his manifold gifts, and showing that salvation was to be
      extended to all nations. But the words of Luke (Acts 2:9)
      clearly show that the various peoples in Jerusalem at the
      time of Pentecost did really hear themselves addressed in
      their own special language with which they were naturally
      acquainted (comp. Joel 2:28, 29).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the gifts of the Spirit the apostle enumerates in 1
      Cor. 12:10-14:30, &quot;divers kinds of tongues&quot; and
      the &quot;interpretation of tongues.&quot; This
      &quot;gift&quot; was a different manifestation of the
      Spirit from that on Pentecost, although it resembled it in
      many particulars. Tongues were to be &quot;a sign to them
      that believe not.&quot;
