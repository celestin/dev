      regarding which retaliatory punishment was to be inflicted
      (Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21). &quot;Gnashing of
      teeth&quot; =rage, despair (Matt. 8:12; Acts 7:54);
      &quot;cleanness of teeth&quot; =famine (Amos 4:6);
      &quot;children&#39;s teeth set on edge&quot; =children
      suffering for the sins of their fathers (Ezek. 18:2).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003701"><b>Topaz -</b> Heb. pitdah (Ezek. 28:13;
      Rev. 21:20), a golden yellow or &quot;green&quot; stone
      brought from Cush or Ethiopia (Job 28:19). It was the
      second stone in the first row in the breastplate of the
      high priest, and had the name of Simeon inscribed on it
      (Ex. 28:17). It is probably the chrysolite of the
      moderns.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003702"><b>Tophel -</b> lime, a place in the
      wilderness of Sinai (Deut. 1:1), now identified with
      Tafyleh or Tufileh, on the west side of the Edomitish
      mountains.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003703"><b>Tophet -</b> =Topheth, from Heb. toph
      &quot;a drum,&quot; because the cries of children here
      sacrificed by the priests of Moloch were drowned by the
      noise of such an instrument; or from taph or toph, meaning
      &quot;to burn,&quot; and hence a place of burning, the name
      of a particular part in the valley of Hinnom. &quot;Fire
      being the most destructive of all elements, is chosen by
      the sacred writers to symbolize the agency by which God
      punishes or destroys the wicked. We are not to assume from
      prophetical figures that material fire is the precise agent
      to be used. It was not the agency employed in the
      destruction of Sennacherib, mentioned in Isa.
      30:33...Tophet properly begins where the Vale of Hinnom
      bends round to the east, having the cliffs of Zion on the
      north, and the Hill of Evil Counsel on the south. It
      terminates at Beer &#39;Ayub, where it joins the Valley of
      Jehoshaphat. The cliffs on the southern side especially
      abound in ancient tombs. Here the dead carcasses of beasts
      and every offal and abomination were cast, and left to be
      either devoured by that worm that never died or consumed by
      that fire that was never quenched.&quot; Thus Tophet came
      to represent the place of punishment. (See <a href=

      betrayal, when our Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane,
      Judas, &quot;having received a band of men and officers
      from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with
      lanterns and torches and weapons&quot; (John 18:1-3).
      Although it was the time of full moon, yet in the valley of
      the Kidron &quot;there fell great, deep shadows from the
      declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were
      there caverns and grottos, into which a fugitive might
      retreat; finally, there were probably a garden-house and
      tower, into whose gloom it might be necessary for a
      searcher to throw light around.&quot; Lange&#39;s
      Commentary. (Nahum 2:3, &quot;torches,&quot; Revised
      Version, &quot;steel,&quot; probably should be
      &quot;scythes&quot; for war-chariots.)</a>

      <a name="T0003705"><b>Torment -</b> Gr. basanos (Matt.
      4:24), the &quot;touch-stone&quot; of justice; hence
      inquisition by torture, and then any disease which racks
      and tortures the limbs.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003706"><b>Tortoise -</b> (Heb. tsabh). Ranked
      among the unclean animals (Lev. 11:29). Land tortoises are
      common in Syria. The LXX. renders the word by &quot;land
      crocodile.&quot; The word, however, more probably denotes a
      lizard, called by the modern Arabs <i>dhabb</i>.</a>

      <a name="T0003708"><b>Tower of the furnaces -</b> (Neh.
      3:11; 12:38), a tower at the north-western angle of the
      second wall of Jerusalem. It was probably so named from its
      contiguity to the &quot;bakers&#39; street&quot; (Jer.
      37:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003709"><b>Towers -</b> of Babel (Gen. 11:4),
      Edar (Gen. 35:21), Penuel (Judg. 8:9, 17), Shechem (9:46),
      David (Cant. 4:4), Lebanon (7:4), Syene (Ezek. 29:10),
      Hananeel (Zech. 14:10), Siloam (Luke 13:4). There were
      several towers in Jerusalem (2 Chr. 26:9; Ps. 48:12). They
      were erected for various purposes, as watch-towers in
      vineyard (Isa. 5:2; Matt. 21:33) and towers for
      defence.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003710"><b>Trachonitis -</b> a rugged region,
      corresponds to the Heb. Argob (q.v.), the Greek name of a
      region on the east of Jordan (Luke 3:1); one of the five
      Roman provinces into which that district was divided. It
      was in the tetrarchy of Philip, and is now called the
      Lejah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003711"><b>Tradition -</b> any kind of teaching,
      written or spoken, handed down from generation to
      generation. In Mark 7:3, 9, 13, Col. 2:8, this word refers
      to the arbitrary interpretations of the Jews. In 2 Thess.
      2:15; 3:6, it is used in a good sense. Peter (1 Pet. 1:18)
      uses this word with reference to the degenerate Judaism of
      the &quot;strangers scattered&quot; whom he addresses
      (comp. Acts 15:10; Matt. 15:2-6; Gal. 1:14).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003712"><b>Trance -</b> (Gr. ekstasis, from
      which the word &quot;ecstasy&quot; is derived) denotes the
      state of one who is &quot;out of himself.&quot; Such were
      the trances of Peter and Paul, Acts 10:10; 11:5; 22:17,
      ecstasies, &quot;a preternatural, absorbed state of mind
      preparing for the reception of the vision&quot;, (comp. 2
      Cor. 12:1-4). In Mark 5:42 and Luke 5:26 the Greek word is
      rendered &quot;astonishment,&quot; &quot;amazement&quot;
      (comp. Mark 16:8; Acts 3:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003713"><b>Transfiguration, the -</b> of our
      Lord on a &quot;high mountain apart,&quot; is described by
      each of the three evangelists (Matt. 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-8;
      Luke 9:28-36). The fullest account is given by Luke, who,
      no doubt, was informed by Peter, who was present on the
      occasion. What these evangelists record was an absolute
      historical reality, and not a mere vision. The concurrence
      between them in all the circumstances of the incident is
      exact. John seems to allude to it also (John 1:14). Forty
      years after the event Peter distinctly makes mention of it
      (2 Pet. 1:16-18). In describing the sanctification of
      believers, Paul also seems to allude to this majestic and
      glorious appearance of our Lord on the &quot;holy
      mount&quot; (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of the transfiguration was probably Mount Hermon
      (q.v.), and not Mount Tabor, as is commonly supposed.

      which the Israelites built for the Egyptians (Ex. 1:11).

      Judah were kept were so designated (1 Chr. 27:25).</a>

      <a name="T0003715"><b>Treasure houses -</b> the houses or
      magazines built for the safe keeping of treasure and
      valuable articles of any kind (Ezra 5:17; 7:20; Neh. 10:38;
      Dan. 1:2).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003716"><b>Treasury -</b> (Matt. 27:6; Mark
      12:41; John 8:20). It does not appear that there was a
      separate building so called. The name was given to the
      thirteen brazen chests, called &quot;trumpets,&quot; from
      the form of the opening into which the offerings of the
      temple worshippers were put. These stood in the outer
      &quot;court of the women.&quot; &quot;Nine chests were for
      the appointed money-tribute and for the sacrifice-tribute,
      i.e., money-gifts instead of the sacrifices; four chests
      for freewill-offerings for wood, incense, temple
      decoration, and burnt-offerings&quot; (Lightfoot&#39;s Hor.
      Heb.).</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003717"><b>Tree of life -</b> stood also in the
      midst of the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:9; 3:22). Some writers
      have advanced the opinion that this tree had some secret
      virtue, which was fitted to preserve life. Probably the
      lesson conveyed was that life was to be sought by man, not
      in himself or in his own power, but from without, from Him
      who is emphatically the Life (John 1:4; 14:6). Wisdom is
      compared to the tree of life (Prov. 3:18). The &quot;tree
      of life&quot; spoken of in the Book of Revelation (Rev.
      2:7; 22:2, 14) is an emblem of the joys of the celestial
      paradise.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003718"><b>Tree of the knowledge of good and evil -</b> stood in the midst of the garden of Eden, beside
      the tree of life (Gen. 2, 3). Adam and Eve were forbidden
      to take of the fruit which grew upon it. But they disobeyed
      the divine injunction, and so sin and death by sin entered
      our world and became the heritage of Adam&#39;s posterity.

      where sins were more private. (See <a href=

      of the Hebrews were the twelve collections of families
      which sprang from the sons of Jacob. In Matt. 24:30 the
      word has a wider significance. The tribes of Israel are
      referred to as types of the spiritual family of God (Rev.
      7). (See ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF &macr;T0001909; JUDAH, KINGDOM

      affiction of any kind (Deut. 4:30; Matt. 13:21; 2 Cor.
      7:4). In Rom. 2:9 &quot;tribulation and anguish&quot; are
      the penal sufferings that shall overtake the wicked. In
      Matt. 24:21, 29, the word denotes the calamities that were
      to attend the destruction of Jerusalem.</a>

      on his subjects (2 Sam. 20:24; 1 Kings 4:6; Rom. 13:6). In
      Matt. 17:24-27 the word denotes the temple rate (the
      &quot;didrachma,&quot; the &quot;half-shekel,&quot; as
      rendered by the R.V.) which was required to be paid for the
      support of the temple by every Jew above twenty years of
      age (Ex. 30:12; 2 Kings 12:4; 2 Chr. 24:6, 9). It was not a
      civil but a religious tax.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Matt. 22:17, Mark 12:14, Luke 20:22, the word may be
      interpreted as denoting the capitation tax which the Romans
      imposed on the Jewish people. It may, however, be
      legitimately regarded as denoting any tax whatever imposed
      by a foreign power on the people of Israel. The
      &quot;tribute money&quot; shown to our Lord (Matt. 22:19)
      was the denarius, bearing Caesar&#39;s superscription. It
      was the tax paid by every Jew to the Romans. (See <a href=

      Scripture, but used to express the doctrine of the unity of
      God as subsisting in three distinct Persons. This word is
      derived from the Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D.
      168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by
      Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The
      propositions involved in the doctrine are these: 1. That
      God is one, and that there is but one God (Deut. 6:4; 1
      Kings 8:60; Isa. 44:6; Mark 12:29, 32; John 10:30). 2. That
      the Father is a distinct divine Person (hypostasis,
      subsistentia, persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct
      from the Son and the Holy Spirit. 3. That Jesus Christ was
      truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the Father
      and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit is also a
      distinct divine Person.</a>

      Mysia, in the north-west of Asia Minor, named after ancient
      Troy, which was at some little distance from it (about 4
      miles) to the north. Here Paul, on his second missionary
      journey, saw the vision of a &quot;man of Macedonia,&quot;
      who appeared to him, saying, &quot;Come over, and help
      us&quot; (Acts 16:8-11). He visited this place also on
      other occasions, and on one of these visits he left his
      cloak and some books there (2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13). The
      ruins of Troas extend over many miles, the site being now

      Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had
      brought him with him into the temple, raised a tumult which
      resulted in Paul&#39;s imprisonment. (See TEMPLE,
      HEROD&#39;S &macr;T0003611.) In writing to Timothy, the
      apostle says, &quot;Trophimus have I left at Miletum

      giving signals of war. Some were also made of rams&#39;

      circumstances that the trumpets usually blown at the
      commencement of each month were on that occasion blown with
      unusual solemnity (Lev. 23:23-25; Num. 10:10; 29:1-6). It
      was one of the seven days of holy convocation. The special
      design of this feast, which is described in these verses,
      is not known.</a>

      Scripture. In Prov. 12:17, 19, it denotes that which is
      opposed to falsehood. In Isa. 59:14, 15, Jer. 7:28, it
      means fidelity or truthfulness. The doctrine of Christ is
      called &quot;the truth of the gospel&quot; (Gal. 2:5),
      &quot;the truth&quot; (2 Tim. 3:7; 4:4). Our Lord says of
      himself, &quot;I am the way, and the truth&quot; (John

    <p>
      (2.) A nation, probably descended from the son of Japheth.
      It is mentioned by Isaiah (66:19), along with Javan, and by
      Ezekiel (27:13), along with Meshech, among the traders with
      Tyre, also among the confederates of Gog (Ezek. 38:2, 3;
      39:1), and with Meshech among the nations which were to be
      destroyed (32:26). This nation was probably the Tiberini of
      the Greek historian Herodotus, a people of the Asiatic
      highland west of the Upper Euphrates, the southern range of
      the Caucasus, on the east of the Black Sea.

    <p>
      <a name="T0003733"><b>Turtle, Turtle-dove -</b> Its
      peculiar peaceful and gentle habit its often referred to in
      Scripture. A pair was offered in sacrifice by Mary at her
      purification (Luke 2:24). The pigeon and the turtle-dove
      were the only birds permitted to be offered in sacrifice
      (Lev. 1:14; 5:7; 14:22; 15:14, 29, etc.). The Latin name of
      this bird, <i>turtur</i>, is derived from its note, and is
      a repetition of the Hebrew name <i>tor</i>. Three species
      are found in Palestine, (1) the turtle-dove (Turtur
      auritus), (2) the collared turtle (T. risorius), and (3)
      the palm turtle (T. Senegalensis). But it is to the first
      of these species which the various passages of Scripture
      refer. It is a migratory bird (Jer. 8:7; Cant. 2:11, 12).
      &quot;Search the glades and valleys, even by sultry Jordan,
      at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be seen.
      Return in the second week of April, and clouds of doves are
      feeding on the clovers of the plain. They overspread the
      whole face of the land.&quot; &quot;Immediately on its
      arrival it pours forth from every garden, grove, and wooded
      hill its melancholy yet soothing ditty unceasingly from
      early dawn till sunset. It is from its plaintive and
      continuous note, doubtless, that David, pouring forth his
      heart&#39;s sorrow to God, compares himself to a
      turtle-dove&quot; (Ps. 74:19).</a>

      Christian, a &quot;faithful minister in the Lord&quot;
      (Eph. 6:21, 22), who, with Trophimus, accompanied Paul on a
      part of his journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem (Acts
      20:4). He is alluded to also in Col. 4:7, Titus 3:12, and 2
      Tim. 4:12 as having been with Paul at Rome, whence he sent
      him to Ephesus, probably for the purpose of building up and
      encouraging the church there.</a>

      <a name="T0003735"><b>Type -</b> occurs only once in
      Scripture (1 Cor. 10:11, A.V. marg.). The Greek word <i>
      tupos</i> is rendered &quot;print&quot; (John 20:25),
      &quot;figure&quot; (Acts 7:43; Rom. 5:14),
      &quot;fashion&quot; (Acts 7:44), &quot;manner&quot; (Acts
      23:25), &quot;form&quot; (Rom. 6:17), &quot;example&quot;

      Thess. 1:7; 2 Thess. 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12). It properly means a
      &quot;model&quot; or &quot;pattern&quot; or
      &quot;mould&quot; into which clay or wax was pressed, that
      it might take the figure or exact shape of the mould. The
      word &quot;type&quot; is generally used to denote a
      resemblance between something present and something future,
      which is called the &quot;antitype.&quot;</a>

      rhetorician, in whose &quot;school&quot; at Ephesus Paul
      disputed daily for the space of two years with those who
      came to him (Acts 19:9). Some have supposed that he was a
      Jew, and that his &quot;school&quot; was a private

    <p>
      <a name="T0003737"><b>Tyre -</b> a rock, now es-Sur; an
      ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line,
      north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest
      Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious
      history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into
      the warehouses of Tyre. &quot;Tyrian merchants were the
      first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters;
      and they founded their colonies on the coasts and
      neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the
      northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in
      Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond
      the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)&quot;
      (Driver&#39;s Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly
      alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the
      Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings (2
      Sam. 5:11; 1 Kings 5:1; 2 Chr. 2:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on
      the mainland, called &quot;Old Tyre,&quot; and the city,
      built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant
      from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was
      besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the
      Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by
      Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years,
      apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the
      power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven
      months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial
      importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in
      Matt. 11:21 and Acts 12:20. In A.D. 1291 it was taken by
      the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on
      account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its
      manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the
      inhabitants of that city.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Tyre and Sidon &quot;were crowded with glass-shops,
      dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning
      workmen not the least important class were those who were
      celebrated for the engraving of precious stones.&quot; (2
      Chr. 2:7,14).
    </p>
    <p>
      The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently
      denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction
      predicted (Isa. 23:1; Jer. 25:22; Ezek. 26; 28:1-19; Amos
      1:9, 10; Zech. 9:2-4).

      Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen,
      and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey
      spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there (Acts
      21:4). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his
      leaving them. They all, with their wives and children,
      accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the
      apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre.
      Thence he proceeded to Caesarea (Acts 21:5-8).

      &quot;It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and
      claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded
      about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was
      of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at
      Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean.
      It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by
      Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It
      is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and
      a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth
      century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered.&quot;

      <a name="T0003738"><b>Tyropoeon Valley -</b> (i.e.,
      &quot;Valley of the Cheesemongers&quot;), the name given by
      Josephus the historian to the valley or rugged ravine which
      in ancient times separated Mount Moriah from Mount Zion.
      This valley, now filled up with a vast accumulation of
      rubbish, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the
      most noted of which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the
      ordinary means of communication between the royal palace on
      Zion and the temple. A fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this
      bridge (called &quot;Robinson&#39;s Arch&quot;), where it
      projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by
      Robinson in 1839. This arch was destroyed by the Romans
      when Jerusalem was taken.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The western wall of the temple area rose up from the bottom
      of this valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a
      level with the area, and above this, and as a continuance
      of it, the wall of Solomon&#39;s cloister rose to the
      height of about 50 feet, &quot;so that this section of the
      wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of
      masonry scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in
      the world.&quot;

      a river of Susiana. It was probably the eastern branch of
      the Choasper (Kerkhan), which divided into two branches
      some 20 miles above the city of Susa. Hence Daniel (8:2,16)
      speaks of standing &quot;between the banks of Ulai&quot;,

      Isa. 34:7, R.V., &quot;wild oxen&quot;), and untamable (Job
      39:9). It was in reality a two-horned animal; but the exact
      reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful. Some
      have supposed it to be the buffalo; others, the white
      antelope, called by the Arabs rim. Most probably, however,
      the word denotes the Bos primigenius (&quot;primitive
      ox&quot;), which is now extinct all over the world. This
      was the auerochs of the Germans, and the urus described by
      Caesar (Gal. Bel., vi.28) as inhabiting the Hercynian
      forest. The word thus rendered has been found in an
      Assyrian inscription written over the wild ox or bison,
      which some also suppose to be the animal intended (comp.

      <a name="T0003747"><b>Ur -</b> light, or the moon city, a
      city &quot;of the Chaldees,&quot; the birthplace of Haran
      (Gen. 11:28,31), the largest city of Shinar or northern
      Chaldea, and the principal commercial centre of the country
      as well as the centre of political power. It stood near the
      mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is
      represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen)
      of el-Mugheir, i.e., &quot;the bitumined,&quot; or
      &quot;the town of bitumen,&quot; now 150 miles from the sea
      and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the
      point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from
      the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters
      of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the
      port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the
      dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of
      India, Ethiopia, and Egypt. It was abandoned about B.C.
      500, but long continued, like Erech, to be a great sacred
      cemetery city, as is evident from the number of tombs found
      there. (See <a href=
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0000000.html&amp;from=T0000054&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      ABRAHAM</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The oldest king of Ur known to us is Ur-Ba&#39;u (servant
      of the goddess Ba&#39;u), as Hommel reads the name, or
      Ur-Gur, as others read it. He lived some twenty-eight
      hundred years B.C., and took part in building the famous
      temple of the moon-god Sin in Ur itself. The illustration
      here given represents his cuneiform inscription, written in
      the Sumerian language, and stamped upon every brick of the
      temple in Ur. It reads: &quot;Ur-Ba&#39;u, king of Ur, who
      built the temple of the moon-god.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Ur was consecrated to the worship of Sin, the
      Babylonian moon-god. It shared this honour, however, with
      another city, and this city was Haran, or Harran. Harran
      was in Mesopotamia, and took its name from the highroad
      which led through it from the east to the west. The name is
      Babylonian, and bears witness to its having been founded by
      a Babylonian king. The same witness is still more
      decisively borne by the worship paid in it to the
      Babylonian moon-god and by its ancient temple of Sin.
      Indeed, the temple of the moon-god at Harran was perhaps
      even more famous in the Assyrian and Babylonian world than
      the temple of the moon-god at Ur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Between Ur and Harran there must, consequently, have
      been a close connection in early times, the record of which
      has not yet been recovered. It may be that Harran owed its
      foundation to a king of Ur; at any rate the two cities were
      bound together by the worship of the same deity, the
      closest and most enduring bond of union that existed in the
      ancient world. That Terah should have migrated from Ur to
      Harran, therefore, ceases to be extraordinary. If he left
      Ur at all, it was the most natural place to which to go. It
      was like passing from one court of a temple into another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Such a remarkable coincidence between the Biblical
      narrative and the evidence of archaeological research
      cannot be the result of chance. The narrative must be
      historical; no writer of late date, even if he were a
      Babylonian, could have invented a story so exactly in
      accordance with what we now know to have been the truth.
      For a story of the kind to have been the invention of
      Palestinian tradition is equally impossible. To the
      unprejudiced mind there is no escape from the conclusion
      that the history of the migration of Terah from Ur to
      Harran is founded on fact&quot; (Sayce).

      viewed as a great crime (Ps. 15:5; Prov. 28:8; Jer. 15:10).
      After the Return, and later, this law was much neglected

      Amaziah&#39;s sons, whom the people made king of Judah in
      his father&#39;s stead (2 Kings 14:21; 2 Chr. 26:1). His
      long reign of about fifty-two years was &quot;the most
      prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of
      Solomon.&quot; He was a vigorous and able ruler, and
      &quot;his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of
      Egypt&quot; (2 Chr. 26:8, 14). In the earlier part of his
      reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to
      Jehovah, and &quot;did that which was right in the sight of
      the Lord&quot; (2 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 26:4, 5); but toward
      the close of his long life &quot;his heart was lifted up to
      his destruction,&quot; and he wantonly invaded the
      priest&#39;s office (2 Chr. 26:16), and entering the
      sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar.
      Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring
      act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty
      priests he withstood him (2 Chr. 26:17), saying, &quot;It
      appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense.&quot;
      Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of
      offering incense (26:19-21), and he was driven from the
      temple and compelled to reside in &quot;a several
      house&quot; to the day of his death (2 Kings 15:5, 27; 2
      Chr. 26:3). He was buried in a separate grave &quot;in the
      field of the burial which belonged to the kings&quot; (2
      Kings 15:7; 2 Chr. 26:23). &quot;That lonely grave in the

      separated these two places. In it were two folding-doors,
      which are supposed to have been always open, the entrance
      being concealed by the veil which the high priest lifted
      when he entered into the sanctuary on the day of Atonement.

      PENTATEUCH</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The Targums. After the return from the Captivity, the
      Jews, no longer familiar with the old Hebrew, required that
      their Scriptures should be translated for them into the
      Chaldaic or Aramaic language and interpreted. These
      translations and paraphrases were at first oral, but they
      were afterwards reduced to writing, and thus targums, i.e.,
      &quot;versions&quot; or &quot;translations&quot;, have come
      down to us. The chief of these are, (1.) The Onkelos
      Targum, i.e., the targum of Akelas=Aquila, a targum so
      called to give it greater popularity by comparing it with
      the Greek translation of Aquila mentioned below. This
      targum originated about the second century after Christ.
      (2.) The targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel comes next to that
      of Onkelos in respect of age and value. It is more a
      paraphrase on the Prophets, however, than a translation.
      Both of these targums issued from the Jewish school which
      then flourished at Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Greek Versions. (1.) The oldest of these is the
      Septuagint, usually quoted as the LXX. The origin of this
      the most important of all the versions is involved in much
      obscurity. It derives its name from the popular notion that
      seventy-two translators were employed on it by the
      direction of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and that
      it was accomplished in seventy-two days, for the use of the
      Jews residing in that country. There is no historical
      warrant for this notion. It is, however, an established
      fact that this version was made at Alexandria; that it was
      begun about 280 B.C., and finished about 200 or 150 B.C.;
      that it was the work of a number of translators who
      differed greatly both in their knowledge of Hebrew and of
      Greek; and that from the earliest times it has borne the
      name of &quot;The Septuagint&quot;, i.e., The Seventy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;This version, with all its defects, must be of the
      greatest interest, (a) as preserving evidence for the text
      far more ancient than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts; (b) as
      the means by which the Greek Language was wedded to Hebrew
      thought; (c) as the source of the great majority of
      quotations from the Old Testament by writers of the New
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The New Testament manuscripts fall into two divisions,
      Uncials, written in Greek capitals, with no distinction at
      all between the different words, and very little even
      between the different lines; and Cursives, in small Greek
      letters, and with divisions of words and lines. The change
      between the two kinds of Greek writing took place about the
      tenth century. Only five manuscripts of the New Testament
      approaching to completeness are more ancient than this
      dividing date. The first, numbered A, is the Alexandrian
      manuscript. Though brought to this country by Cyril Lucar,
      patriarch of Constantinople, as a present to Charles I., it
      is believed that it was written, not in that capital, but
      in Alexandria; whence its title. It is now dated in the
      fifth century A.D. The second, known as B, is the Vatican
      manuscript. (See <a href=
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003700.html&amp;from=T0003766&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      VATICANUS</a>.) The Third, C, or the Ephraem manuscript,
      was so called because it was written over the writings of
      Ephraem, a Syrian theological author, a practice very
      common in the days when writing materials were scarce and
      dear. It is believed that it belongs to the fifth century,
      and perhaps a slightly earlier period of it than the
      manuscript A. The fourth, D, or the manuscript of Beza, was
      so called because it belonged to the reformer Beza, who
      found it in the monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons in 1562
      A.D. It is imperfect, and is dated in the sixth century.
      The fifth (called Aleph) is the Sinaitic manuscript. (See
      <a href=

    <p>
      3. The Syriac Versions. (See <a href=
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0003500.html&amp;from=T0003549&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      SYRIAC</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Latin Versions. A Latin version of the Scriptures,
      called the &quot;Old Latin,&quot; which originated in North
      Africa, was in common use in the time of Tertullian (A.D.
      150). Of this there appear to have been various copies or
      recensions made. That made in Italy, and called the Itala,
      was reckoned the most accurate. This translation of the Old
      Testament seems to have been made not from the original
      Hebrew but from the LXX.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version became greatly corrupted by repeated
      transcription, and to remedy the evil Jerome (A.D. 329-420)
      was requested by Damasus, the bishop of Rome, to undertake
      a complete revision of it. It met with opposition at first,
      but was at length, in the seventh century, recognized as
      the &quot;Vulgate&quot; version. It appeared in a printed
      from about A.D. 1455, the first book that ever issued from
      the press. The Council of Trent (1546) declared it
      &quot;authentic.&quot; It subsequently underwent various
      revisions, but that which was executed (1592) under the
      sanction of Pope Clement VIII. was adopted as the basis of
      all subsequent editions. It is regarded as the sacred
      original in the Roman Catholic Church. All modern European
      versions have been more or less influenced by the Vulgate.
      This version reads <i>ipsa_ instead of _ipse</i> in Gen.
      3:15, &quot;She shall bruise thy head.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There are several other ancient versions which are of
      importance for Biblical critics, but which we need not
      mention particularly, such as the Ethiopic, in the fourth
      century, from the LXX.; two Egyptian versions, about the
      fourth century, the Memphitic, circulated in Lower Egypt,
      and the Thebaic, designed for Upper Egypt, both from the
      Greek; the Gothic, written in the German language, but with
      the Greek alphabet, by Ulphilas (died A.D. 388), of which
      only fragments of the Old Testament remain; the Armenian,
      about A.D. 400; and the Slavonic, in the ninth century, for
      ancient Moravia. Other ancient versions, as the Arabic, the
      Persian, and the Anglo-Saxon, may be mentioned.

      6. The history of the English versions begins properly with
      Wyckliffe. Portions, however, of the Scriptures were
      rendered into Saxon (as the Gospel according to John, by
      Bede, A.D. 735), and also into English (by Orme, called the
      &quot;Ormulum,&quot; a portion of the Gospels and of the
      Acts in the form of a metrical paraphrase, toward the close
      of the seventh century), long before Wyckliffe; but it is
      to him that the honour belongs of having first rendered the
      whole Bible into English (A.D. 1380). This version was made
      from the Vulgate, and renders Gen. 3:15 after that Version,
      &quot;She shall trede thy head.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was followed by Tyndale&#39;s translation (1525-1531);
      Miles Coverdale&#39;s (1535-1553); Thomas Matthew&#39;s
      (1537), really, however, the work of John Rogers, the first
      martyr under the reign of Queen Mary. This was properly the
      first Authorized Version, Henry VIII. having ordered a copy
      of it to be got for every church. This took place in less
      than a year after Tyndale was martyred for the crime of
      translating the Scriptures. In 1539 Richard Taverner
      published a revised edition of Matthew&#39;s Bible. The
      Great Bible, so called from its great size, called also
      Cranmer&#39;s Bible, was published in 1539 and 1568. In the
      strict sense, the &quot;Great Bible&quot; is &quot;the only
      authorized version; for the Bishops&#39; Bible and the
      present Bible [the A.V.] never had the formal sanction of
      royal authority.&quot; Next in order was the Geneva version
      (1557-1560); the Bishops&#39; Bible (1568); the Rheims and
      Douai versions, under Roman Catholic auspices (1582, 1609);
      the Authorized Version (1611); and the Revised Version of
      the New Testament in 1880 and of the Old Testament in 1884.

      <a name="T0003769"><b>Villages -</b> (Judg. 5:7, 11). The
      Hebrew word thus rendered (perazon) means habitations in
      the open country, unwalled villages (Deut. 3:5; 1 Sam.
      6:18). Others, however, following the LXX. and the Vulgate
      versions, render the word &quot;rulers.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003770"><b>Vine -</b> one of the most important
      products of Palestine. The first mention of it is in the
      history of Noah (Gen. 9:20). It is afterwards frequently
      noticed both in the Old and New Testaments, and in the
      ruins of terraced vineyards there are evidences that it was
      extensively cultivated by the Jews. It was cultivated in
      Palestine before the Israelites took possession of it. The
      men sent out by Moses brought with them from the Valley of
      Eshcol a cluster of grapes so large that &quot;they bare it
      between two upon a staff&quot; (Num. 13: 23). The vineyards
      of En-gedi (Cant. 1:14), Heshbon, Sibmah, Jazer, Elealeh
      (Isa. 16:8-10; Jer. 48:32, 34), and Helbon (Ezek. 27:18),
      as well as of Eshcol, were celebrated.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church is compared to a vine (Ps. 80:8), and Christ
      says of himself, &quot;I am the vine&quot; (John 15:1). In
      one of his parables also (Matt. 21:33) our Lord compares
      his Church to a vineyard which &quot;a certain householder
      planted, and hedged round about,&quot; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hos. 10:1 is rendered in the Revised Version, &quot;Israel
      is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit,&quot;
      instead of &quot;Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth
      fruit unto himself,&quot; of the Authorized Version.

      <a name="T0003771"><b>Vinegar -</b> Heb. hometz, Gr. oxos,
      Fr. vin aigre; i.e., &quot;sour wine.&quot; The Hebrew word
      is rendered vinegar in Ps. 69:21, a prophecy fulfilled in
      the history of the crucifixion (Matt. 27:34). This was the
      common sour wine (posea) daily made use of by the Roman
      soldiers. They gave it to Christ, not in derision, but from
      compassion, to assuage his thirst. Prov. 10:26 shows that
      there was also a stronger vinegar, which was not fit for
      drinking. The comparison, &quot;vinegar upon nitre,&quot;
      probably means &quot;vinegar upon soda&quot; (as in the
      marg. of the R.V.), which then effervesces.</a>

      <a name="T0003772"><b>Vine of Sodom -</b> referred to only
      in Deut. 32:32. Among the many conjectures as to this tree,
      the most probable is that it is the &#39;osher of the
      Arabs, which abounds in the region of the Dead Sea. Its
      fruit are the so-called &quot;apples of Sodom,&quot; which,
      though beautiful to the eye, are exceedingly bitter to the
      taste. (See EN-GEDI &macr;T0001207.) The people of Israel
      are referred to here by Moses as being utterly corrupt,
      bringing forth only bitter fruit.</a>

      59:5, the Heb. word eph&#39;eh is thus rendered. The Hebrew
      word, however, probably denotes a species of poisonous
      serpents known by the Arabic name of &#39;el ephah.
      Tristram has identified it with the sand viper, a species
      of small size common in sandy regions, and frequently found
      under stones by the shores of the Dead Sea. It is rapid in
      its movements, and highly poisonous. In the New Testament
      <i>echidne</i> is used (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33) for any
      poisonous snake. The viper mentioned in Acts 28:3 was
      probably the vipera aspis, or the Mediterranean viper. (See

      (comp. Luke 1:31-35). The people of the land of Zidon are
      thus referred to by Isaiah (23:12), &quot;O thou oppressed
      virgin, daughter of Zidon;&quot; and of the people of

      desolate condition (Ps. 79:1, 4, 5). The stones in this
      part of the wall are of great size, and were placed, as is
      generally believed, in the position in which they are now
      found in the time of Solomon. &quot;The congregation at the
      wailing-place is one of the most solemn gatherings left to
      the Jewish Church, and as the writer gazed at the motley

      remnants of the chosen race should be heartlessly thrust
      outside the sacred enclosure of their fathers&#39; holy
      temple by men of an alien race and an alien creed. Many of

      strong (Num. 13:28; Deut. 3:5). Among the Jews walls were

      tribes were finally subdued. Except in the case of Jericho
      and Ai, the war did not become aggressive till after the
      death of Joshua. Till then the attack was always first made
      by the Canaanites. Now the measure of the iniquity of the
      Canaanites was full, and Israel was employed by God to
      sweep them away from off the face of the earth. In entering
      on this new stage of the war, the tribe of Judah, according
      to divine direction, took the lead.</a>

      In the days of Saul and David the people of Israel engaged
      in many wars with the nations around, and after the
      division of the kingdom into two they often warred with
      each other. They had to defend themselves also against the
      inroads of the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the
      Babylonians. The whole history of Israel from first to last
      presents but few periods of peace.

      regarded as a great sin, a sin equal to the breach of any
      of the ten commandments. Moses had commanded washings oft,
      but always for some definite cause; but the Jews multiplied
      the legal observance till they formed a large body of
      precepts. To such precepts about ceremonial washing Mark
      here refers. (See <a href=

      of the approach of an enemy (2 Sam. 18:24-27; 2 Kings
      9:17-20; Isa. 21:5-9). They were sometimes placed for this

      first-fruits, a sheaf of barley, offered at the feast of
      Pentecost (Lev. 23:17-20), and wheat-bread, the
      first-fruits of the second harvest, offered at the Passover
      (10-14), were wave-offerings.</a>

      <a name="T0003796"><b>Wax -</b> Made by melting the combs
      of bees. Mentioned (Ps. 22:14; 68:2; 97:5; Micah 1:4) in
      illustration.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003797"><b>Wean -</b> Among the Hebrews children
      (whom it was customary for the mothers to nurse, Ex. 2:7-9;
      1 Sam. 1:23; Cant. 8:1) were not generally weaned till they
      were three or four years old.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003798"><b>Weasel -</b> (Heb. holedh),
      enumerated among unclean animals (Lev. 11:29). Some think
      that this Hebrew word rather denotes the mole (Spalax
      typhlus) common in Palestine. There is no sufficient
      reason, however, to depart from the usual translation. The
      weasel tribe are common also in Palestine.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003799"><b>Weaving, weavers -</b> Weaving was an
      art practised in very early times (Ex. 35:35). The
      Egyptians were specially skilled in it (Isa. 19:9; Ezek.
      27:7), and some have regarded them as its inventors.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wilderness, the Hebrews practised it (Ex. 26:1, 8;
      28:4, 39; Lev. 13:47). It is referred to in subsequent
      times as specially the women&#39;s work (2 Kings 23:7;
      Prov. 31:13, 24). No mention of the loom is found in
      Scripture, but we read of the &quot;shuttle&quot; (Job
      7:6), &quot;the pin&quot; of the beam (Judg. 16:14),
      &quot;the web&quot; (13, 14), and &quot;the beam&quot; (1
      Sam. 17:7; 2 Sam. 21:19). The rendering, &quot;with pining
      sickness,&quot; in Isa. 38:12 (A.V.) should be, as in the
      Revised Version, &quot;from the loom,&quot; or, as in the
      margin, &quot;from the thrum.&quot; We read also of the
      &quot;warp&quot; and &quot;woof&quot; (Lev. 13:48, 49,
      51-53, 58, 59), but the Revised Version margin has, instead
      of &quot;warp,&quot; &quot;woven or knitted stuff.&quot;
