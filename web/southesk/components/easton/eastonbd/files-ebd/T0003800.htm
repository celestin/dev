      <a name="T0003800"><b>Week -</b> From the beginning, time
      was divided into weeks, each consisting of six days of
      working and one of rest (Gen. 2:2, 3; 7:10; 8:10, 12;
      29:28). The references to this division of days becomes
      afterwards more frequent (Ex. 34:22; Lev. 12:5; Num. 28:26;
      Deut. 16:16; 2 Chr. 8:13; Jer. 5:24; Dan. 9:24-27; 10:2,
      3). It has been found to exist among almost all
      nations.</a>

      PENTECOST</a>.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003802"><b>Weights -</b> Reduced to English
      troy-weight, the Hebrew weights were: (1.) The gerah (Lev.
      27:25; Num. 3:47), a Hebrew word, meaning a grain or
      kernel, and hence a small weight. It was the twentieth part
      of a shekel, and equal to 12 grains.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Bekah (Ex. 38:26), meaning &quot;a half&quot; i.e.,
      &quot;half a shekel,&quot; equal to 5 pennyweight.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) Shekel, &quot;a weight,&quot; only in the Old
      Testament, and frequently in its original form (Gen. 23:15,
      16; Ex. 21:32; 30:13, 15; 38:24-29, etc.). It was equal to
      10 pennyweight.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Ma&#39;neh, &quot;a part&quot; or &quot;portion&quot;
      (Ezek. 45:12), equal to 60 shekels, i.e., to 2 lbs. 6 oz.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Talent of silver (2 Kings 5:22), equal to 3,000
      shekels, i.e., 125 lbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6.) Talent of gold (Ex. 25:39), double the preceding,
      i.e., 250 lbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003803"><b>Well -</b> (Heb. beer), to be
      distinguished from a fountain (Heb. &#39;ain). A
      &quot;beer&quot; was a deep shaft, bored far under the
      rocky surface by the art of man, which contained water
      which percolated through the strata in its sides. Such
      wells were those of Jacob and Beersheba, etc. (see Gen.
      21:19, 25, 30, 31; 24:11; 26:15, 18-25, 32, etc.). In the
      Pentateuch this word beer, so rendered, occurs twenty-five
      times.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003804"><b>Westward -</b> sea-ward, i.e., toward
      the Mediterranean (Deut. 3:27).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003805"><b>Whale -</b> The Hebrew word <i>
      tan</i> (plural, tannin) is so rendered in Job 7:12 (A.V.;
      but R.V., &quot;sea-monster&quot;). It is rendered by
      &quot;dragons&quot; in Deut. 32:33; Ps. 91:13; Jer. 51:34;
      Ps. 74:13 (marg., &quot;whales;&quot; and marg. of R.V.,
      &quot;sea-monsters&quot;); Isa. 27:1; and
      &quot;serpent&quot; in Ex. 7:9 (R.V. marg., &quot;any large
      reptile,&quot; and so in ver. 10, 12). The words of Job
      (7:12), uttered in bitter irony, where he asks, &quot;Am I
      a sea or a whale?&quot; simply mean, &quot;Have I a wild,
      untamable nature, like the waves of the sea, which must be
      confined and held within bounds, that they cannot
      pass?&quot; &quot;The serpent of the sea, which was but the
      wild, stormy sea itself, wound itself around the land, and
      threatened to swallow it up...Job inquires if he must be
      watched and plagued like this monster, lest he throw the
      world into disorder&quot; (Davidson&#39;s Job).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The whale tribe are included under the general Hebrew name
      <i>tannin</i> (Gen. 1:21; Lam. 4:3). &quot;Even the
      sea-monsters [tanninim] draw out the breast.&quot; The
      whale brings forth its young alive, and suckles them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be noticed of the story of Jonah&#39;s being
      &quot;three days and three nights in the whale&#39;s
      belly,&quot; as recorded in Matt. 12:40, that here the Gr.
      ketos means properly any kind of sea-monster of the shark
      or the whale tribe, and that in the book of Jonah (1:17) it
      is only said that &quot;a great fish&quot; was prepared to
      swallow Jonah. This fish may have been, therefore, some
      great shark. The white shark is known to frequent the
      Mediterranean Sea, and is sometimes found 30 feet in
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003806"><b>Wheat -</b> one of the earliest
      cultivated grains. It bore the Hebrew name <i>hittah</i>,
      and was extensively cultivated in Palestine. There are
      various species of wheat. That which Pharaoh saw in his
      dream was the Triticum compositum, which bears several ears
      upon one stalk (Gen. 41:5). The &quot;fat of the kidneys of
      wheat&quot; (Deut. 32:14), and the &quot;finest of the
      wheat&quot; (Ps. 81:16; 147:14), denote the best of the
      kind. It was exported from Palestine in great quantities (1
      Kings 5:11; Ezek. 27:17; Acts 12:20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Parched grains of wheat were used for food in Palestine
      (Ruth 2:14; 1 Sam. 17:17; 2 Sam. 17:28). The disciples,
      under the sanction of the Mosaic law (Deut. 23:25), plucked
      ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands, ate the
      grain unroasted (Matt. 12:1; Mark 2:23; Luke 6:1). Before
      any of the wheat-harvest, however, could be eaten, the
      first-fruits had to be presented before the Lord (Lev.
      23:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003807"><b>Wheel -</b> (Heb. galgal; rendered
      &quot;wheel&quot; in Ps. 83:13, and &quot;a rolling
      thing&quot; in Isa. 17:13; R.V. in both, &quot;whirling
      dust&quot;). This word has been supposed to mean the wild
      artichoke, which assumes the form of a globe, and in autumn
      breaks away from its roots, and is rolled about by the wind
      in some places in great numbers.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003808"><b>White -</b> a symbol of purity (2
      Chr. 5:12; Ps. 51:7; Isa. 1:18; Rev. 3:18; 7:14). Our Lord,
      at his transfiguration, appeared in raiment &quot;white as
      the light&quot; (Matt. 17:2, etc.).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003809"><b>Widows -</b> to be treated with
      kindness (Ex. 22:22; Deut. 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24:17, 19-21;
      26:12; 27:19, etc.). In the New Testament the same tender
      regard for them is inculcated (Acts 6:1-6; 1 Tim. 5:3-16)
      and exhibited.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003810"><b>Wife -</b> The ordinance of marriage
      was sanctioned in Paradise (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:4-6).
      Monogamy was the original law under which man lived, but
      polygamy early commenced (Gen. 4:19), and continued to
      prevail all down through Jewish history. The law of Moses
      regulated but did not prohibit polygamy. A man might have a
      plurality of wives, but a wife could have only one husband.
      A wife&#39;s legal rights (Ex. 21:10) and her duties (Prov.
      31:10-31; 1 Tim. 5:14) are specified. She could be divorced
      in special cases (Deut. 22:13-21), but could not divorce
      her husband. Divorce was restricted by our Lord to the
      single case of adultery (Matt. 19:3-9). The duties of
      husbands and wives in their relations to each other are
      distinctly set forth in the New Testament (1 Cor. 7:2-5;
      Eph. 5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003811"><b>Wilderness -</b> (1.) Heb. midhbar,
      denoting not a barren desert but a district or region
      suitable for pasturing sheep and cattle (Ps. 65:12; Isa.
      42:11; Jer. 23:10; Joel 1:19; 2:22); an uncultivated place.
      This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba (Gen.
      21:14), on the southern border of Palestine; the wilderness
      of the Red Sea (Ex. 13:18); of Shur (15:22), a portion of
      the Sinaitic peninsula; of Sin (17:1), Sinai (Lev. 7:38),
      Moab (Deut. 2:8), Judah (Judg. 1:16), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi
      (1 Sam. 23:14, 24; 24:1), Jeruel and Tekoa (2 Chr. 20:16,
      20), Kadesh (Ps. 29:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The wilderness of the sea&quot; (Isa. 21:1).
      Principal Douglas, referring to this expression, says:
      &quot;A mysterious name, which must be meant to describe
      Babylon (see especially ver. 9), perhaps because it became
      the place of discipline to God&#39;s people, as the
      wilderness of the Red Sea had been (comp. Ezek. 20:35).
      Otherwise it is in contrast with the symbolic title in Isa.
      22:1. Jerusalem is the &quot;valley of vision,&quot; rich
      in spiritual husbandry; whereas Babylon, the rival centre
      of influence, is spiritually barren and as restless as the
      sea (comp. 57:20).&quot; A Short Analysis of the O.T.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Jeshimon, a desert waste (Deut. 32:10; Ps. 68:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) &#39;Arabah, the name given to the valley from the
      Dead Sea to the eastern branch of the Red Sea. In Deut.
      1:1; 2:8, it is rendered &quot;plain&quot; (R.V.,
      &quot;Arabah&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Tziyyah, a &quot;dry place&quot; (Ps. 78:17; 105:41).
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) Tohu, a &quot;desolate&quot; place, a place
      &quot;waste&quot; or &quot;unoccupied&quot; (Deut. 32:10;
      Job 12:24; comp. Gen. 1:2, &quot;without form&quot;). The
      wilderness region in the Sinaitic peninsula through which
      for forty years the Hebrews wandered is generally styled
      &quot;the wilderness of the wanderings.&quot; This entire
      region is in the form of a triangle, having its base toward
      the north and its apex toward the south. Its extent from
      north to south is about 250 miles, and at its widest point
      it is about 150 miles broad. Throughout this vast region of
      some 1,500 square miles there is not a single river. The
      northern part of this triangular peninsula is properly the
      &quot;wilderness of the wanderings&quot; (et-Tih). The
      western portion of it is called the &quot;wilderness of
      Shur&quot; (Ex. 15:22), and the eastern the
      &quot;wilderness of Paran.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;wilderness of Judea&quot; (Matt. 3:1) is a wild,
      barren region, lying between the Dead Sea and the Hebron
      Mountains. It is the &quot;Jeshimon&quot; mentioned in 1
      Sam. 23:19.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003812"><b>Willows -</b> (1.) Heb. &#39;arabim
      (Lev. 23:40; Job 40:22; Isa. 15:7; 44:3, 4; Ps. 137:1, 2).
      This was supposed to be the weeping willow, called by
      Linnaeus Salix Babylonica, from the reference in Ps. 137.
      This tree is frequently found &quot;on the coast,
      overhanging wells and pools. There is a conspicuous tree of
      this species over a pond in the plain of Acre, and others
      on the Phoenician plain.&quot; There are several species of
      the salix in Palestine, but it is not indigenous to
      Babylonia, nor was it cultivated there. Some are of opinion
      that the tree intended is the tamarisk or poplar.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Heb. tzaphtzaphah (Ezek. 17:5), called by the Arabs
      the safsaf, the general name for the willow. This may be
      the Salix AEgyptica of naturalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tristram thinks that by the &quot;willow by the
      water-courses,&quot; the Nerium oleander, the rose-bay
      oleander, is meant. He says, &quot;It fringes the Upper
      Jordan, dipping its wavy crown of red into the spray in the
      rapids under Hermon, and is nutured by the oozy marshes in
      the Lower Jordan nearly as far as to Jericho...On the
      Arnon, on the Jabbok, and the Yarmuk it forms a continuous
      fringe. In many of the streams of Moab it forms a complete
      screen, which the sun&#39;s rays can never penetrate to
      evaporate the precious moisture. The wild boar lies safely
      ensconced under its impervious cover.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003813"><b>Wimple -</b> Isa. 3:22, (R.V.,
      &quot;shawls&quot;), a wrap or veil. The same Hebrew word
      is rendered &quot;vail&quot; (R.V., &quot;mantle&quot;) in
      Ruth 3:15.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003814"><b>Window -</b> properly only an opening
      in a house for the admission of light and air, covered with
      lattice-work, which might be opened or closed (2 Kings 1:2;
      Acts 20:9). The spies in Jericho and Paul at Damascus were
      let down from the windows of houses abutting on the town
      wall (Josh. 2:15; 2 Cor. 11:33). The clouds are
      metaphorically called the &quot;windows of heaven&quot;
      (Gen. 7:11; Mal. 3:10). The word thus rendered in Isa.
      54:12 ought rather to be rendered &quot;battlements&quot;
      (LXX., &quot;bulwarks;&quot; R.V., &quot;pinnacles&quot;),
      or as Gesenius renders it, &quot;notched battlements, i.e.,
      suns or rays of the sun&quot;= having a radiated appearance
      like the sun.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003815"><b>Winds -</b> blowing from the four
      quarters of heaven (Jer. 49:36; Ezek. 37:9; Dan. 8:8; Zech.
      2:6). The east wind was parching (Ezek. 17:10; 19:12), and
      is sometimes mentioned as simply denoting a strong wind
      (Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8). This wind prevails in Palestine
      from February to June, as the west wind (Luke 12:54) does
      from November to February. The south was a hot wind (Job
      37:17; Luke 12:55). It swept over the Arabian peninsula.
      The rush of invaders is figuratively spoken of as a
      whirlwind (Isa. 21:1); a commotion among the nations of the
      world as a striving of the four winds (Dan. 7:2). The winds
      are subject to the divine power (Ps. 18:10; 135:7).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003816"><b>Wine -</b> The common Hebrew word for
      wine is <i>yayin</i>, from a root meaning &quot;to boil
      up,&quot; &quot;to be in a ferment.&quot; Others derive it
      from a root meaning &quot;to tread out,&quot; and hence the
      juice of the grape trodden out. The Greek word for wine is
      <i>oinos_, and the Latin _vinun</i>. But besides this
      common Hebrew word, there are several others which are thus
      rendered.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (1.) Ashishah (2 Sam. 6:19; 1 Chr. 16:3; Cant. 2:5; Hos.
      3:1), which, however, rather denotes a solid cake of
      pressed grapes, or, as in the Revised Version, a cake of
      raisins.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) &#39;Asis, &quot;sweet wine,&quot; or &quot;new
      wine,&quot; the product of the same year (Cant. 8:2; Isa.
      49:26; Joel 1:5; 3:18; Amos 9:13), from a root meaning
      &quot;to tread,&quot; hence juice trodden out or pressed
      out, thus referring to the method by which the juice is
      obtained. The power of intoxication is ascribed to it.
    </p>

      VINEGAR</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) Hemer, Deut. 32:14 (rendered &quot;blood of the
      grape&quot;) Isa. 27:2 (&quot;red wine&quot;), Ezra 6:9;
      7:22; Dan. 5:1, 2, 4. This word conveys the idea of
      &quot;foaming,&quot; as in the process of fermentation, or
      when poured out. It is derived from the root <i>hamar</i>,
      meaning &quot;to boil up,&quot; and also &quot;to be
      red,&quot; from the idea of boiling or becoming inflamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5.) &#39;Enabh, a grape (Deut. 32:14). The last clause of
      this verse should be rendered as in the Revised Version,
      &quot;and of the blood of the grape [&#39;enabh] thou
      drankest wine [hemer].&quot; In Hos. 3:1 the phrase in
      Authorized Version, &quot;flagons of wine,&quot; is in the
      Revised Version correctly &quot;cakes of raisins.&quot;
      (Comp. Gen. 49:11; Num. 6:3; Deut. 23:24, etc., where this
      Hebrew word is rendered in the plural &quot;grapes.&quot;)

    <p>
      (6.) Mesekh, properly a mixture of wine and water with
      spices that increase its stimulating properties (Isa.
      5:22). Ps. 75:8, &quot;The wine [yayin] is red; it is full
      of mixture [mesekh];&quot; Prov. 23:30, &quot;mixed
      wine;&quot; Isa. 65:11, &quot;drink offering&quot; (R.V.,
      &quot;mingled wine&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      (7.) Tirosh, properly &quot;must,&quot; translated
      &quot;wine&quot; (Deut. 28:51); &quot;new wine&quot; (Prov.
      3:10); &quot;sweet wine&quot; (Micah 6:15; R.V.,
      &quot;vintage&quot;). This Hebrew word has been traced to a
      root meaning &quot;to take possession of&quot; and hence it
      is supposed that tirosh is so designated because in
      intoxicating it takes possession of the brain. Among the
      blessings promised to Esau (Gen. 27:28) mention is made of
      &quot;plenty of corn and tirosh.&quot; Palestine is called
      &quot;a land of corn and tirosh&quot; (Deut. 33:28; comp.
      Isa. 36:17). See also Deut. 28:51; 2 Chr. 32:28; Joel 2:19;
      Hos. 4:11, (&quot;wine [yayin] and new wine [tirosh] take
      away the heart&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      (8.) Sobhe (root meaning &quot;to drink to excess,&quot;
      &quot;to suck up,&quot; &quot;absorb&quot;), found only in
      Isa. 1:22, Hos. 4:18 (&quot;their drink;&quot; Gesen. and
      marg. of R.V., &quot;their carouse&quot;), and Nah. 1:10
      (&quot;drunken as drunkards;&quot; lit., &quot;soaked
      according to their drink;&quot; R.V., &quot;drenched, as it
      were, in their drink&quot;, i.e., according to their
      sobhe).
    </p>
    <p>
      (9.) Shekar, &quot;strong drink,&quot; any intoxicating
      liquor; from a root meaning &quot;to drink deeply,&quot;
      &quot;to be drunken&quot;, a generic term applied to all
      fermented liquors, however obtained. Num. 28:7,
      &quot;strong wine&quot; (R.V., &quot;strong drink&quot;).
      It is sometimes distinguished from wine, c.g., Lev. 10:9,
      &quot;Do not drink wine [yayin] nor strong drink
      [shekar];&quot; Num. 6:3; Judg. 13:4, 7; Isa. 28:7 (in all
      these places rendered &quot;strong drink&quot;). Translated
      &quot;strong drink&quot; also in Isa. 5:11; 24:9; 29:9;
      56:12; Prov. 20:1; 31:6; Micah 2:11.
    </p>
    <p>
      (10.) Yekebh (Deut. 16:13, but in R.V. correctly
      &quot;wine-press&quot;), a vat into which the new wine
      flowed from the press. Joel 2:24, &quot;their vats;&quot;
      3:13, &quot;the fats;&quot; Prov. 3:10, &quot;Thy presses
      shall burst out with new wine [tirosh];&quot; Hag. 2:16;
      Jer. 48:33, &quot;wine-presses;&quot; 2 Kings 6:27; Job.
      24:11.
    </p>
    <p>
      (11.) Shemarim (only in plural), &quot;lees&quot; or
      &quot;dregs&quot; of wine. In Isa. 25:6 it is rendered
      &quot;wines on the lees&quot;, i.e., wine that has been
      kept on the lees, and therefore old wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      (12.) Mesek, &quot;a mixture,&quot; mixed or spiced wine,
      not diluted with water, but mixed with drugs and spices to
      increase its strength, or, as some think, mingled with the
      lees by being shaken (Ps. 75:8; Prov. 23:30).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Acts 2:13 the word <i>gleukos</i>, rendered &quot;new
      wine,&quot; denotes properly &quot;sweet wine.&quot; It
      must have been intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to wine the Hebrews also made use of what they
      called <i>debash</i>, which was obtained by boiling down
      must to one-half or one-third of its original bulk. In Gen.
      43:11 this word is rendered &quot;honey.&quot; It was a
      kind of syrup, and is called by the Arabs at the present
      day dibs. This word occurs in the phrase &quot;a land
      flowing with milk and honey&quot; (debash), Ex. 3:8, 17;
      13:5; 33:3; Lev. 20:24; Num. 13: 27. (See <a href=

    <p>
      Our Lord miraculously supplied wine at the marriage feast
      in Cana of Galilee (John 2:1-11). The Rechabites were
      forbidden the use of wine (Jer. 35). The Nazarites also
      were to abstain from its use during the period of their vow
      (Num. 6:1-4); and those who were dedicated as Nazarites
      from their birth were perpetually to abstain from it (Judg.
      13:4, 5; Luke 1:15; 7:33). The priests, too, were forbidden
      the use of wine and strong drink when engaged in their
      sacred functions (Lev. 10:1, 9-11). &quot;Wine is little
      used now in the East, from the fact that Mohammedans are
      not allowed to taste it, and very few of other creeds touch
      it. When it is drunk, water is generally mixed with it, and
      this was the custom in the days of Christ also. The people
      indeed are everywhere very sober in hot climates; a drunken
      person, in fact, is never seen&quot;, (Geikie&#39;s Life of
      Christ). The sin of drunkenness, however, must have been
      not uncommon in the olden times, for it is mentioned either
      metaphorically or literally more than seventy times in the
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drink-offering of wine was presented with the daily
      sacrifice (Ex. 29:40, 41), and also with the offering of
      the first-fruits (Lev. 23:13), and with various other
      sacrifices (Num. 15:5, 7, 10). Wine was used at the
      celebration of the Passover. And when the Lord&#39;s Supper
      was instituted, the wine and the unleavened bread then on
      the paschal table were by our Lord set apart as memorials
      of his body and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several emphatic warnings are given in the New Testament
      against excess in the use of wine (Luke 21:34; Rom. 13:13;
      Eph. 5:18; 1 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003817"><b>Winefat -</b> (Mark 12:1). The
      original word (hypolenion) so rendered occurs only here in
      the New Testament. It properly denotes the trough or lake
      (lacus), as it was called by the Romans, into which the
      juice of the grapes ran from the trough above it. It is
      here used, however, of the whole apparatus. In the parallel
      passage in Matt. 21:33 the Greek word <i>lenos</i> is used.
      This properly denotes the upper one of the two vats. (See
      WINE-PRESS &macr;T0003818.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003818"><b>Wine-press -</b> Consisted of two
      vats or receptacles, (1) a trough (Heb. gath, Gr. lenos)
      into which the grapes were thrown and where they were
      trodden upon and bruised (Isa. 16:10; Lam. 1:15; Joel
      3:13); and (2) a trough or vat (Heb. yekebh, Gr.
      hypolenion) into which the juice ran from the trough above,
      the gath (Neh. 13:15; Job 24:11; Isa. 63:2, 3; Hag. 2:16;
      Joel 2:24). Wine-presses are found in almost every part of
      Palestine. They are &quot;the only sure relics we have of
      the old days of Israel before the Captivity. Between Hebron
      and Beersheba they are found on all the hill slopes; they
      abound in southern Judea; they are no less common in the
      many valleys of Carmel; and they are numerous in
      Galilee.&quot; The &quot;treading of the wine-press&quot;
      is emblematic of divine judgment (Isa. 63:2; Lam. 1:15;
      Rev. 14:19, 20).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003819"><b>Winnow -</b> Corn was winnowed, (1.)
      By being thrown up by a shovel against the wind. As a rule
      this was done in the evening or during the night, when the
      west wind from the sea was blowing, which was a moderate
      breeze and fitted for the purpose. The north wind was too
      strong, and the east wind came in gusts. (2.) By the use of
      a fan or van, by which the chaff was blown away (Ruth 3:2;
      Isa. 30:24; Jer. 4:11, 12; Matt. 3:12).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003820"><b>Wise men -</b> mentioned in Dan. 2:12
      included three classes, (1) astrologers, (2) Chaldeans, and
      (3) soothsayers. The word in the original (hakamim)
      probably means &quot;medicine men. In Chaldea medicine was
      only a branch of magic. The &quot;wise men&quot; of Matt.
      2:7, who came from the East to Jerusalem, were magi from
      Persia or Arabia.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003821"><b>Wise, wisdom -</b> a moral rather
      than an intellectual quality. To be &quot;foolish&quot; is
      to be godless (Ps. 14:1; comp. Judg. 19:23; 2 Sam. 13:13).
      True wisdom is a gift from God to those who ask it (Job
      28:12-28; Prov. 3:13-18; Rom. 1:22; 16:27; 1 Cor. 1:17-21;
      2:6-8; James 1:5). &quot;Wisdom&quot; in Prov. 1:20; 8:1;
      9:1-5 may be regarded not as a mere personification of the
      attribute of wisdom, but as a divine person, &quot;Christ
      the power of God and the wisdom of God&quot; (1 Cor. 1:24).
      In Matt. 11:19 it is the personified principle of wisdom
      that is meant.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003822"><b>Witch -</b> Occurs only in Ex. 22:18,
      as the rendering of <i>mekhashshepheh</i>, the feminine
      form of the word, meaning &quot;enchantress&quot; (R.V.,
      &quot;sorceress&quot;), and in Deut. 18:10, as the
      rendering of <i>mekhashshepheth</i>, the masculine form of
      the word, meaning &quot;enchanter.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003823"><b>Witchcraft -</b> (1 Sam. 15:23; 2
      Kings 9:22; 2 Chr. 33:6; Micah 5:12; Nahum 3:4; Gal. 5:20).
      In the popular sense of the word no mention is made either
      of witches or of witchcraft in Scripture.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;witch of En-dor&quot; (1 Sam. 28) was a
      necromancer, i.e., one who feigned to hold converse with
      the dead. The damsel with &quot;a spirit of
      divination&quot; (Acts 16:16) was possessed by an evil
      spirit, or, as the words are literally rendered,
      &quot;having a spirit, a pithon.&quot; The reference is to
      the heathen god Apollo, who was regarded as the god of
      prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003824"><b>Witness -</b> More than one witness
      was required in criminal cases (Deut. 17:6; 19:15). They
      were the first to execute the sentence on the condemned
      (Deut. 13:9; 17:7; 1 Kings 21:13; Matt. 27:1; Acts 7:57,
      58). False witnesses were liable to punishment (Deut.
      19:16-21). It was also an offence to refuse to bear witness
      (Lev. 5:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003825"><b>Witness of the Spirit -</b> (Rom.
      8:16), the consciousness of the gracious operation of the
      Spirit on the mind, &quot;a certitude of the Spirit&#39;s
      presence and work continually asserted within us&quot;,
      manifested &quot;in his comforting us, his stirring us up
      to prayer, his reproof of our sins, his drawing us to works
      of love, to bear testimony before the world,&quot; etc.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003826"><b>Wizard -</b> a pretender to
      supernatural knowledge and power, &quot;a knowing
      one,&quot; as the original Hebrew word signifies. Such an
      one was forbidden on pain of death to practise his
      deceptions (Lev. 19:31; 20:6, 27; 1 Sam. 28:3; Isa. 8:19;
      19:3).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003827"><b>Wolf -</b> Heb. zeeb, frequently
      referred to in Scripture as an emblem of treachery and
      cruelty. Jacob&#39;s prophecy, &quot;Benjamin shall ravin
      as a wolf&quot; (Gen. 49:27), represents the warlike
      character of that tribe (see Judg. 19-21). Isaiah
      represents the peace of Messiah&#39;s kingdom by the words,
      &quot;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb&quot; (Isa.
      11:6). The habits of the wolf are described in Jer. 5:6;
      Hab. 1:8; Zeph. 3:3; Ezek. 22:27; Matt. 7:15; 10:16; Acts
      20:29. Wolves are still sometimes found in Palestine, and
      are the dread of shepherds, as of old.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003828"><b>Woman -</b> was &quot;taken out of
      man&quot; (Gen. 2:23), and therefore the man has the
      preeminence. &quot;The head of the woman is the man;&quot;
      but yet honour is to be shown to the wife, &quot;as unto
      the weaker vessel&quot; (1 Cor. 11:3, 8, 9; 1 Pet. 3:7).
      Several women are mentioned in Scripture as having been
      endowed with prophetic gifts, as Miriam (Ex. 15:20),
      Deborah (Judg. 4:4, 5), Huldah (2 Kings 22:14), Noadiah
      (Neh. 6:14), Anna (Luke 2:36, 37), and the daughters of
      Philip the evangelist (Acts 21:8, 9). Women are forbidden
      to teach publicly (1 Cor. 14:34, 35; 1 Tim. 2:11, 12).
      Among the Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the
      meals for the household (Gen. 18:6; 2 Sam. 13:8), to attend
      to the work of spinning (Ex. 35:26; Prov. 31:19), and
      making clothes (1 Sam. 2:19; Prov. 31:21), to bring water
      from the well (Gen. 24:15; 1 Sam. 9:11), and to care for
      the flocks (Gen. 29:6; Ex. 2:16).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &quot;woman,&quot; as used in Matt. 15:28, John
      2:4 and 20:13, 15, implies tenderness and courtesy and not
      disrespect. Only where revelation is known has woman her
      due place of honour assigned to her.

      13:31). It would seem that in the time of Nehemiah
      arrangements were made, probably on account of the
      comparative scarcity of wood, by which certain districts
      were required, as chosen by lot, to furnish wood to keep
      the altar fire perpetually burning (Lev. 6:13).</a>

      <a name="T0003831"><b>Wool -</b> one of the first material
      used for making woven cloth (Lev. 13:47, 48, 52, 59;
      19:19). The first-fruit of wool was to be offered to the
      priests (Deut. 18:4). The law prohibiting the wearing of a
      garment &quot;of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen
      together&quot; (Deut. 22:11) may, like some other laws of a
      similar character, have been intended to express
      symbolically the separateness and simplicity of God&#39;s
      covenant people. The wool of Damascus, famous for its
      whiteness, was of great repute in the Tyrian market (Ezek.
      27:18).</a>

      <a name="T0003832"><b>Word of God -</b> (Heb. 4:12, etc.).
      The Bible so called because the writers of its several
      books were God&#39;s organs in communicating his will to
      men. It is his &quot;word,&quot; because he speaks to us in
      its sacred pages. Whatever the inspired writers here
      declare to be true and binding upon us, God declares to be

      the revealer of God. His office is to make God known.
      &quot;No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten
      Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
      him&quot; (John 1:18). This title designates the divine
      nature of Christ. As the Word, he &quot;was in the
      beginning&quot; and &quot;became flesh.&quot; &quot;The
      Word was with God &quot; and &quot;was God,&quot; and was

      <a name="T0003835"><b>Works, Good -</b> The old objection
      against the doctrine of salvation by grace, that it does
      away with the necessity of good works, and lowers the sense
      of their importance (Rom. 6), although it has been answered
      a thousand times, is still alleged by many. They say if men
      are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If
      the most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very
      chief of sinners, then good works are of no moment. And
      more than this, if the grace of God is most clearly
      displayed in the salvation of the vilest of men, then the
      worse men are the better.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The objection has no validity. The gospel of salvation by
      grace shows that good works are necessary. It is true,
      unchangeably true, that without holiness no man shall see
      the Lord. &quot;Neither adulterers, nor thieves, nor
      covetous, nor drunkards&quot; shall inherit the kingdom of
      God.

    <p>
      Works are &quot;good&quot; only when, (1) they spring from
      the principle of love to God. The moral character of an act
      is determined by the moral principle that prompts it. Faith
      and love in the heart are the essential elements of all
      true obedience. Hence good works only spring from a
      believing heart, can only be wrought by one reconciled to
      God (Eph. 2:10; James 2:18:22). (2.) Good works have the
      glory of God as their object; and (3) they have the
      revealed will of God as their only rule (Deut. 12:32; Rev.
      22:18, 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Good works are an expression of gratitude in the
      believer&#39;s heart (John 14:15, 23; Gal. 5:6). They are
      the fruits of the Spirit (Titus 2:10-12), and thus spring
      from grace, which they illustrate and strengthen in the
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good works of the most sincere believers are all imperfect,
      yet like their persons they are accepted through the
      mediation of Jesus Christ (Col. 3:17), and so are rewarded;
      they have no merit intrinsically, but are rewarded wholly
      of grace.

      <a name="T0003836"><b>Worm -</b> (1.) Heb. sas (Isa. 51:8),
      denotes the caterpillar of the clothes-moth.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The manna bred worms (tola&#39;im), but on the Sabbath
      there was not any worm (rimmah) therein (Ex. 16:20, 24).
      Here these words refer to caterpillars or larvae, which
      feed on corrupting matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two Hebrew words appear to be interchangeable (Job
      25:6; Isa. 14:11). Tola&#39;im in some places denotes the
      caterpillar (Deut. 28:39; Jonah 4:7), and rimmah, the
      larvae, as bred from putridity (Job 17:14; 21:26; 24:20).
      In Micah 7:17, where it is said, &quot;They shall move out
      of their holes like worms,&quot; perhaps serpents or
      &quot;creeping things,&quot; or as in the Revised Version,
      &quot;crawling things,&quot; are meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word is used figuratively in Job 25:6; Ps. 22:6; Isa.
      41:14; Mark 9:44, 46, 48; Isa. 66:24.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003837"><b>Wormwood -</b> Heb. la&#39;anah, the
      Artemisia absinthium of botanists. It is noted for its
      intense bitterness (Deut. 29:18; Prov. 5:4; Jer. 9:15; Amos
      5:7). It is a type of bitterness, affliction, remorse,
      punitive suffering. In Amos 6:12 this Hebrew word is
      rendered &quot;hemlock&quot; (R.V., &quot;wormwood&quot;).
      In the symbolical language of the Apocalypse (Rev. 8:10,
      11) a star is represented as falling on the waters of the
      earth, causing the third part of the water to turn
      wormwood.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The name by which the Greeks designated it, absinthion,
      means &quot;undrinkable.&quot; The absinthe of France is
      distilled from a species of this plant. The
      &quot;southernwood&quot; or &quot;old man,&quot; cultivated
      in cottage gardens on account of its fragrance, is another
      species of it.

      which it is sinful (idolatry) to render to any created
      being (Ex. 34:14; Isa. 2:8). Such worship was refused by
      Peter (Acts 10:25,26) and by an angel (Rev. 22:8,9).</a>

      <a name="T0003841"><b>Writing -</b> The art of writing must
      have been known in the time of the early Pharaohs. Moses is
      commanded &quot;to write for a memorial in a book&quot;
      (Ex. 17:14) a record of the attack of Amalek. Frequent
      mention is afterwards made of writing (28:11, 21, 29, 36;
      31:18; 32:15, 16; 34:1, 28; 39:6, 14, 30). The origin of
      this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that
      in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books
      of Moses are the most ancient extant writings, although
      there are written monuments as old as about B.C. 2000. The
      words expressive of &quot;writing,&quot; &quot;book,&quot;
      and &quot;ink,&quot; are common to all the branches or
      dialects of the Semitic language, and hence it has been
      concluded that this art must have been known to the
      earliest Semites before they separated into their various
      tribes, and nations, and families.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The Old Testament and the discoveries of Oriental
      archaeology alike tell us that the age of the Exodus was
      throughout the world of Western Asia an age of literature
      and books, of readers and writers, and that the cities of
      Palestine were stored with the contemporaneous records of
      past events inscribed on imperishable clay. They further
      tell us that the kinsfolk and neighbours of the Israelites
      were already acquainted with alphabetic writing, that the
      wanderers in the desert and the tribes of Edom were in
      contact with the cultured scribes and traders of Ma&#39;in
      [Southern Arabia], and that the &#39;house of bondage&#39;
      from which Israel had escaped was a land where the art of
      writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods,
      but also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful.&quot;,
      Sayce. (See DEBIR &macr;T0000995; <a href=

      The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; was a collection of
      prayers and formulae, by the use of which the souls of the
      dead were supposed to attain to rest and peace in the next
      world. It was composed at various periods from the earliest
      time to the Persian conquest. It affords an interesting
      glimpse into the religious life and system of belief among
      the ancient Egyptians. We learn from it that they believed
      in the existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of
      the soul, judgement after death, and the resurrection of
      the body. It shows, too, a high state of literary activity
      in Egypt in the time of Moses. It refers to extensive
      libraries then existing. That of Ramessium, in Thebes,
      e.g., built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Hebrews entered Canaan it is evident that the art
      of writing was known to the original inhabitants, as
      appears, e.g., from the name of the city Debir having been
      at first Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the &quot;city of the
      book,&quot; or the &quot;book town&quot; (Josh. 10:38;
      15:15; Judg. 1:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first mention of letter-writing is in the time of David
      (2 Sam. 11:14, 15). Letters are afterwards frequently
      spoken of (1 Kings 21:8, 9, 11; 2 Kings 10:1, 3, 6, 7;
      19:14; 2 Chr. 21:12-15; 30:1, 6-9, etc.).

    <p>
      <a name="T0003842"><b>Yarn -</b> Found only in 1 Kings
      10:28, 2 Chr. 1:16. The Heb. word mikveh, i.e., &quot;a
      stringing together,&quot; so rendered, rather signifies a
      host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized
      Version has: &quot;And Solomon had horses brought out of
      Egypt, and linen yarn: the king&#39;s merchants received
      the linen yarn at a price;&quot; but the Revised Version
      correctly renders: &quot;And the horses which Solomon had
      were brought out of Egypt; the king&#39;s merchants
      received them in droves, each drove at a price.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003843"><b>Year -</b> Heb. shanah, meaning
      &quot;repetition&quot; or &quot;revolution&quot; (Gen.
      1:14; 5:3). Among the ancient Egyptians the year consisted
      of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added
      to make it a complete revolution of the earth round the
      sun. The Jews reckoned the year in two ways, (1) according
      to a sacred calendar, in which the year began about the
      time of the vernal equinox, with the month Abib; and (2)
      according to a civil calendar, in which the year began
      about the time of the autumnal equinox, with the month
      Nisan. The month Tisri is now the beginning of the Jewish
      year.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003844"><b>Yeshebi -</b> the Hebrew word
      rendered &quot;inhabitants&quot; in Josh. 17:7, but
      probably rather the name of the village Yeshepheh, probably
      Yassuf, 8 miles south of Shechem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003845"><b>Yoke -</b> (1.) Fitted on the neck of
      oxen for the purpose of binding to them the traces by which
      they might draw the plough, etc. (Num. 19:2; Deut. 21:3).
      It was a curved piece of wood called <i>&#39;ol</i>.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) In Jer. 27:2; 28:10, 12 the word in the Authorized
      Version rendered &quot;yoke&quot; is <i>motah</i>, which
      properly means a &quot;staff,&quot; or as in the Revised
      Version, &quot;bar.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of
      severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection (Lev. 26:13; 1
      Kings 12:4; Isa. 47:6; Lam. 1:14; 3:27). In the New
      Testament the word &quot;yoke&quot; is also used to denote
      servitude (Matt. 11:29, 30; Acts 15:10; Gal. 5:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) In 1 Sam. 11:7, 1 Kings 19:21, Job 1:3 the word thus
      translated is <i>tzemed</i>, which signifies a pair, two
      oxen yoked or coupled together, and hence in 1 Sam. 14:14
      it represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough
      in a day, like the Latin <i>jugum</i>. In Isa. 5:10 this
      word in the plural is translated &quot;acres.&quot;
    </p>

      <a name="T0003846"><b>Yoke-fellow -</b> (Phil. 4:3), one of
      the apostle&#39;s fellow-labourers. Some have conjectured
      that Epaphroditus is meant. Wyckliffe renders the phrase
      &quot;the german felowe&quot;, i.e., &quot;thee, germane
      [=genuine] comrade.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003847"><b>Zaanaim -</b> wanderings; the
      unloading of tents, so called probably from the fact of
      nomads in tents encamping amid the cities and villages of
      that region, a place in the north-west of Lake Merom, near
      Kedesh, in Naphtali. Here Sisera was slain by Jael,
      &quot;the wife of Heber the Kenite,&quot; who had pitched
      his tent in the &quot;plain [R.V., &#39;as far as the
      oak&#39;] of Zaanaim&quot; (Judg. 4:11).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been, however, suggested by some that, following the
      LXX. and the Talmud, the letter b, which in Hebrew means
      &quot;in,&quot; should be taken as a part of the word
      following, and the phrase would then be &quot;unto the oak
      of Bitzanaim,&quot; a place which has been identified with
      the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and
      Mount Tabor.

      before the multitude who were thronging about Christ as he
      passed through Jericho on his way to Jerusalem, and climbed
      up a sycamore tree that he might be able to see him. When
      our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican
      among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to
      make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide
      at his house. This led to the remarkable interview recorded
      by the evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten
      pounds (Luke 19:12-27). At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a

      &quot;families&quot; of the priests returned from the Exile
      (Ezra 2:36-39); but they were then re-distributed under the
      old designations. The priests served at the temple twice
      each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias&#39;s
      time had come for this service. During this period his home
      would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on
      the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was
      one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the
      temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who
      should have this great honour, an honour which no priest
      could enjoy more than once during his lifetime.</a>

    <p>
      While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense
      in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel
      Gabriel that his wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly
      family, now stricken in years, would give birth to a son
      who was to be called John, and that he would be the
      forerunner of the long-expected Messiah (Luke 1:12-17). As
      a punishment for his refusing to believe this message, he
      was struck dumb and &quot;not able to speak until the day
      that these things should be performed&quot; (20). Nine
      months passed away, and Elisabeth&#39;s child was born, and
      when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a
      &quot;writing tablet,&quot; &quot;His name is John,&quot;
      his mouth was opened, and he praised God (60-79). The child
      (John the Baptist), thus &quot;born out of due time,&quot;
      &quot;waxed strong in spirit&quot; (1:80).

      high priest in the time of David (2 Sam. 20:25) and Solomon
      (1 Kings 4:4). He is first mentioned as coming to take part
      with David at Hebron (1 Chr. 12:27, 28). He was probably on
      this account made ruler over the Aaronites (27:17). Zadok
      and Abiathar acted as high priests on several important
      occasions (1 Chr. 15:11; 2 Sam. 15:24-29, 35, 36); but when
      Adonijah endeavoured to secure the throne, Abiathar went
      with him, and therefore Solomon &quot;thrust him out from
      being high priest,&quot; and Zadok, remaining faithful to
      David, became high priest alone (1 Kings 2:27, 35; 1 Chr.
      29:22). In him the line of Phinehas resumed the dignity,
      and held it till the fall of Jerusalem. He was succeeded in
      his sacred office by his son Azariah (1 Kings 4:2; comp. 1
      Chr. 6:3-9).</a>

      Ammonites, &quot;who called them Zamzummims.&quot; They
      belonged to the Rephaim, and inhabited the country
      afterwards occupied by the Ammonites. It has been
      conjectured that they might be Ham-zuzims, i.e., Zuzims
      dwelling in Ham, a place apparently to the south of

      explained. Some think it means &quot;creator,&quot; or
      &quot;preserver of life.&quot; Brugsch interprets it as
      &quot;governor of the district of the place of life&quot;,
      i.e., of Goshen, the chief city of which was Pithom,
      &quot;the place of life.&quot; Others explain it as meaning

      Zaretan,&quot; probably near Succoth, at the mouth of the
      Jabbok, some 30 miles up the river from where the people
      were encamped. There the water &quot;stood and rose upon an
      heap.&quot; Thus the whole space of 30 miles of the

      grace, it must be grounded on right principles and directed
      to right ends (Gal. 4:18). It is sometimes ascribed to God

      and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan
      with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at
      Karkor, probably in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The

      Mark 15:40). He seems to have been a man of some position
      in Capernaum, for he had two boats (Luke 5:4) and

      informed his master of the intention of the people of
      Shechem to transfer their allegiance to the Hivite tribe of
      Hamor. This led to Abimelech&#39;s destroying the city,

      took little interest in public affairs. It responded,
      however, readily to the summons of Gideon (6:35), and
      afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron (1 Chr.
      12:33, 40). Along with the other northern tribes, Zebulun
      was carried away into the land of Assyria by
      Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings 15:29).</a>

    <p>
      In Deborah&#39;s song the words, &quot;Out of Zebulun they

      been rendered in the R.V., &quot;They that handle the
      marshal&#39;s staff.&quot; This is a questionable
      rendering. &quot;The word <i>sopher</i> (&#39;scribe&#39;
      or &#39;writer&#39;) defines the word <i>shebhet</i>
      (&#39;rod&#39; or &#39;pen&#39;) with which it is
      conjoined. The &#39;rod of the scribe&#39; on the Assyrian
      monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of
      which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus
      inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was
      the associate and assistant of the
      &#39;lawgivers.&#39;&quot; (Sayce).

      <a name="T0003892"><b>Zechariah -</b> Jehovah is renowned
      or remembered. (1.) A prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the
      twelve minor prophets. Like Ezekiel, he was of priestly
      extraction. He describes himself (1:1) as &quot;the son of
      Berechiah.&quot; In Ezra 5:1 and 6:14 he is called
      &quot;the son of Iddo,&quot; who was properly his
      grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second
      year of Darius (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the
      return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary
      with Haggai (Ezra 5:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His book consists of two distinct parts, (1) chapters 1 to
      8, inclusive, and (2) 9 to the end. It begins with a
      preface (1:1-6), which recalls the nation&#39;s past
      history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to
      the present generation. Then follows a series of eight
      visions (1:7-6:8), succeeding one another in one night,
      which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel,
      intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and
      stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the
      crowning of Joshua (6:9-15), describes how the kingdoms of
      the world become the kingdom of God&#39;s Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer
      to the question whether the days of mourning for the
      destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an
      encouraging address to the people, assuring them of
      God&#39;s presence and blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second part of the book (ch. 9-14) bears no date. It is
      probable that a considerable interval separates it from the
      first part. It consists of two burdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first burden (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course
      of God&#39;s providential dealings with his people down to
      the time of the Advent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second burden (ch. 12-14) points out the glories that
      await Israel in &quot;the latter day&quot;, the final
      conflict and triumph of God&#39;s kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son or grandson of Jehoiada, the high priest in
      the times of Ahaziah and Joash. After the death of Jehoiada
      he boldly condemned both the king and the people for their
      rebellion against God (2 Chr. 24:20), which so stirred up
      their resentment against him that at the king&#39;s
      commandment they stoned him with stones, and he died
      &quot;in the court of the house of the Lord&quot; (24:21).
      Christ alludes to this deed of murder in Matt. 23:35, Luke
      11:51. (See ZACHARIAS &macr;T0003862 [2].)
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A prophet, who had &quot;understanding in the seeing
      of God,&quot; in the time of Uzziah, who was much indebted
      to him for his wise counsel (2 Chr. 26:5).
    </p>

      Besides these, there is a large number of persons mentioned
      in Scripture bearing this name of whom nothing is known.

      <a name="T0003893"><b>Zedad -</b> side; sloping place, a
      town in the north of Palestine, near Hamath (Num. 34:8;
      Ezek. 47:15). It has been identified with the ruins of
      Sudud, between Emesa (Hums) and Baalbec, but that is
      uncertain.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003894"><b>Zedekiah -</b> righteousness of
      Jehovah. (1.) The last king of Judah. He was the third son
      of Josiah, and his mother&#39;s name was Hamutal, the
      daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the
      brother of Jehoahaz (2 Kings 23:31; 24:17, 18). His
      original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed
      him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed
      his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his
      counsellor, yet &quot;he did evil in the sight of the
      Lord&quot; (2 Kings 24:19, 20; Jer. 52:2, 3). He ascended
      the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was
      at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the
      strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the
      example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon,
      and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt.
      This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, &quot;with all his
      host&quot; (2 King 25:1), against Jerusalem. During this
      siege, which lasted about eighteen months, &quot;every
      worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of
      God&#39;s fury to the dregs&quot; (2 Kings 25:3; Lam. 4:4,
      5, 10). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah
      and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive
      and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children
      put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded
      with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon
      (2 Kings 25:1-7; 2 Chr. 36:12; Jer. 32:4,5; 34:2, 3;
      39:1-7; 52:4-11; Ezek. 12:12), where he remained a
      prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry
      out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the
      ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen
      were permitted to remain in the land (Jer. 52:16).
      Gedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled
      over Judah (2 Kings 25:22, 24; jer. 40:1, 2, 5, 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son of Chenaanah, a false prophet in the days of
      Ahab (1 Kings 22:11, 24; 2 Chr. 18:10, 23).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) The son of Hananiah, a prince of Judah in the days of
      Jehoiakim (Jer. 36:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003895"><b>Zeeb -</b> the wolf, one of the two
      leaders of the great Midianite host which invaded Israel
      and was utterly routed by Gideon. The division of that
      host, which attempted to escape across the Jordan, under
      Oreb and Zeeb, was overtaken by the Ephraimites, who, in a
      great battle, completely vanquished them, their leaders
      being taken and slain (Judg. 7:25; Ps. 83:11; Isa.
      10:26).</a>

      <a name="T0003896"><b>Zelah -</b> slope; side, a town in
      Benjamin, where Saul and his son Jonathan were buried (2
      Sam. 21:14). It was probably Saul&#39;s birthplace.</a>

    <p>
      <a name="T0003897"><b>Zelek -</b> cleft, an Ammonite; one
      of David&#39;s valiant men (2 Sam. 23:37).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003898"><b>Zelophehad -</b> first-born, of the
      tribe of Manasseh, and of the family of Gilead; died in the
      wilderness. Having left no sons, his daughters, concerned
      lest their father&#39;s name should be &quot;done away from
      among his family,&quot; made an appeal to Moses, who, by
      divine direction, appointed it as &quot;a statute of
      judgment&quot; in Israel that daughters should inherit
      their father&#39;s portion when no sons were left (Num.
      27:1-11). But that the possession of Zelophehad might not
      pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to which he
      belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters
      should not marry any one out of their father&#39;s tribe;
      and this afterwards became a general law (Num. 36).</a>
