      <a name="T0003900"><b>Zemaraim -</b> (1.) A town of
      Benjamin (Josh. 18:22); now the ruin, rather two ruins,
      es-Sumrah, 4 miles north of Jericho.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A mount in the highlands of Ephraim, to the north of
      Jerusalem (2 Chr. 13:4-20). Here the armies of Abijah and
      Jeroboam engaged in a bloody battle, which issued in the
      total defeat of the king of Israel, who never
      &quot;recovered strength again,&quot; and soon after died.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003901"><b>Zemarite -</b> the designation of one
      of the Phoenician tribes (Gen. 10:18) who inhabited the
      town of Sumra, at the western base of the Lebanon range. In
      the Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400) Zemar, or Zumur, was one of
      the most important of the Phoenician cities, but it
      afterwards almost disappears from history.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003902"><b>Zemira -</b> vine-dresser, a
      Benjamite; one of the sons of Becher (1 Chr. 7:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003903"><b>Zenas -</b> a disciple called
      &quot;the lawyer,&quot; whom Paul wished Titus to bring

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003904"><b>Zephaniah -</b> Jehovah has
      concealed, or Jehovah of darkness. (1.) The son of Cushi,
      and great-grandson of Hezekiah, and the ninth in the order
      of the minor prophets. He prophesied in the days of Josiah,
      king of Judah (B.C. 641-610), and was contemporary with
      Jeremiah, with whom he had much in common. The book of his
      prophecies consists of:</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) An introduction (1:1-6), announcing the judgment of the
      world, and the judgment upon Israel, because of their
      transgressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The description of the judgment (1:7-18).
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) An exhortation to seek God while there is still time
      (2:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The announcement of judgment on the heathen (2:4-15).
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) The hopeless misery of Jerusalem (3:1-7).
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) The promise of salvation (3:8-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) The son of Maaseiah, the &quot;second priest&quot; in
      the reign of Zedekiah, often mentioned in Jeremiah as
      having been sent from the king to inquire (Jer. 21:1)
      regarding the coming woes which he had denounced, and to
      entreat the prophet&#39;s intercession that the judgment
      threatened might be averted (Jer. 29:25, 26, 29; 37:3;
      52:24). He, along with some other captive Jews, was put to
      death by the king of Babylon &quot;at Riblah in the land of
      Hamath&quot; (2 Kings 25:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A Kohathite ancestor of the prophet Samuel (1 Chr.
      6:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4.) The father of Josiah, the priest who dwelt in
      Jerusalem when Darius issued the decree that the temple
      should be rebuilt (Zech. 6:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003905"><b>Zephath -</b> beacon; watch-tower, a
      Canaanite town; called also Hormah (q.v.), Judg. 1:17. It
      has been identified with the pass of es-Sufah, but with
      greater probability with S&#39;beita.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003906"><b>Zephathah -</b> a valley in the west
      of Judah, near Mareshah; the scene of Asa&#39;s conflict
      with Zerah the Ethiopian (2 Chr. 14:9-13). Identified with
      the Wady Safieh.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003907"><b>Zerah -</b> sunrise. (1.) An
      &quot;Ethiopian,&quot; probably Osorkon II., the successor
      of Shishak on the throne of Egypt. With an enormous army,
      the largest we read of in Scripture, he invaded the kingdom
      of Judah in the days of Asa (2 Chr. 14:9-15). He reached
      Zephathah, and there encountered the army of Asa. This is
      the only instance &quot;in all the annals of Judah of a
      victorious encounter in the field with a first-class
      heathen power in full force.&quot; The Egyptian host was
      utterly routed, and the Hebrews gathered &quot;exceeding
      much spoil.&quot; Three hundred years elapsed before
      another Egyptian army, that of Necho (B.C. 609), came up
      against Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A son of Tamar (Gen. 38:30); called also Zara (Matt.
      1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3.) A Gershonite Levite (1 Chr. 6:21, 41).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003908"><b>Zered -</b> =Zared, luxuriance;
      willow bush, a brook or valley communicating with the Dead
      Sea near its southern extremity (Num. 21:12; Deut. 2:14).
      It is called the &quot;brook of the willows&quot; (Isa.
      15:7) and the &quot;river of the wilderness&quot; (Amos
      6:14). It has been identified with the Wady el-Aksy.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003909"><b>Zereda -</b> the fortress, a city on
      the north of Mount Ephraim; the birthplace of Jeroboam (1
      Kings 11:26). It is probably the same as Zaretan (Josh.
      3:16), Zererath (Judg. 7:22), Zartanah (1 Kings 4:12), or
      the following.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003910"><b>Zeredathah -</b> a place in the plain
      of Jordan; the same as Zarthan (2 Chr. 4:17; 1 Kings 7:46).
      Here Solomon erected the foundries in which Hiram made the
      great castings of bronze for the temple.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003911"><b>Zererath -</b> (Judg. 7:22), perhaps
      identical with Zereda or Zeredathah. Some identify it with
      Zahrah, a place about 3 miles west of Beth-shean.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003912"><b>Zeresh -</b> star of Venus, the wife
      of Haman, whom she instigated to prepare a gallows for
      Mordecai (Esther 5:10).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003913"><b>Zeruah -</b> stricken, mother of
      Jeroboam, the first king of the ten tribes (1 Kings
      11:26).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003914"><b>Zerubbabel -</b> the seed of Babylon,
      the son of Salathiel or Shealtiel (Hag. 1:1; Zorobabel,
      Matt. 1:12); called also the son of Pedaiah (1 Chr.
      3:17-19), i.e., according to a frequent usage of the word
      &quot;son;&quot; the grandson or the nephew of Salathiel.
      He is also known by the Persian name of Sheshbazzar (Ezra
      1:8, 11). In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, he
      led the first band of Jews, numbering 42,360 (Ezra 2:64),
      exclusive of a large number of servants, who returned from
      captivity at the close of the seventy years. In the second
      year after the Return, he erected an altar and laid the
      foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which had
      been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (3:8-13; ch. 4-6). All
      through the work he occupied a prominent place, inasmuch as
      he was a descendant of the royal line of David.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003915"><b>Zeruiah -</b> stricken of the Lord,
      David&#39;s sister, and the mother of Abishai, Joab, and
      Asahel (1 Chr. 2:16), who were the three leading heroes of
      David&#39;s army, and being his nephews, they were admitted
      to the closest companionship with him.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003916"><b>Zetham -</b> olive planter, a Levite
      (1 Chr. 23:8).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003917"><b>Zethan -</b> a Benjamite (1 Chr.
      7:10).</a>

      5:13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003919"><b>Ziba -</b> post; statue, &quot;a
      servant of the house of Saul&quot; (2 Sam. 9:2), who
      informed David that Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan, was
      alive. He afterwards dealt treacherously toward
      Mephibosheth, whom he slanderously misrepresented to
      David.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003920"><b>Zibeon -</b> robber; or dyed. (1.) A
      Hivite (Gen. 36:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) A Horite, and son of Seir (Gen. 36:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003921"><b>Zibia -</b> gazelle, a Benjamite (1
      Chr. 8:9).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003922"><b>Zibiah -</b> the mother of King Joash
      (2 Kings 12:1; 2 Chr. 24:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003923"><b>Zichri -</b> remembered; illustrious.
      (1.) A Benjamite chief (1 Chr. 8:19).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Another of the same tribe (1 Chr. 8:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003924"><b>Ziddim -</b> sides, a town of
      Naphtali (Josh. 19:35), has been identified with
      Kefr-Hattin, the &quot;village of the Hittites,&quot; about
      5 miles west of Tiberias.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003925"><b>Zidkijah -</b> the Lord is righteous,
      one who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah (Neh. 10:1).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003926"><b>Zidon -</b> a fishery, a town on the
      Mediterranean coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It
      received its name from the &quot;first-born&quot; of
      Canaan, the grandson of Noah (Gen. 10:15, 19). It was the
      first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine,
      and from its extensive commercial relations became a
      &quot;great&quot; city (Josh. 11:8; 19:28). It was the
      mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of
      Asher, but was never subdued (Judg. 1:31). The Zidonians
      long oppressed Israel (Judg. 10:12). From the time of David
      its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its &quot;virgin
      daughter&quot; (Isa. 23:12), rose to its place of
      pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance
      with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous
      worship found a place in the land of Israel (1 Kings 11:1,
      33). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as
      well as for its commerce (1 Kings 5:6; 1 Chr. 22:4; Ezek.
      27:8). It is frequently referred to by the prophets (Isa.
      23:2, 4, 12; Jer. 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezek. 27:8; 28:21, 22;
      32:30; Joel 3:4). Our Lord visited the &quot;coasts&quot;
      of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), Matt. 15:21; Mark 7:24;
      Luke 4:26; and from this region many came forth to hear him
      preaching (Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17). From Sidon, at which the
      ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for
      Rome (Acts 27:3, 4).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains
      of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the
      sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician
      inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a &quot;king
      of the Sidonians,&quot; probably in the third century B.C.,
      and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, &quot;the
      goddess of the Sidonians.&quot; In this inscription Baal is
      mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003927"><b>Zif -</b> brightness; splendour;
      i.e., &quot;the flower month,&quot; mentioned only in 1
      Kings 6:1, 37, as the &quot;second month.&quot; It was
      called Iyar by the later Jews. (See <a href= 
      "http://www.biblehelps.bizland.com/pager.cgi?file=e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0002500.html&amp;from=T0002592&amp;up=e/easton/ebd/ebd.html">
      MONTH</a>.)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003928"><b>Ziha -</b> drought. (1.) The name of
      a family of Nethinim (Ezra 2:43; Neh. 7:46). (2.) A ruler
      among the Nethinim (Neh. 11:21).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003929"><b>Ziklag -</b> a town in the Negeb, or
      south country of Judah (Josh. 15:31), in the possession of
      the Philistines when David fled to Gath from Ziph with all
      his followers. Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his
      place of residence. There he dwelt for over a year and four
      months. From this time it pertained to the kings of Judah
      (1 Sam. 27:6). During his absence with his army to join the
      Philistine expedition against the Israelites (29:11), it
      was destroyed by the Amalekites (30:1, 2), whom David,
      however, pursued and utterly routed, returning all the
      captives (1 Sam. 30:26-31). Two days after his return from
      this expedition, David received tidings of the disastrous
      battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul (2 Sam. 1:1-16).
      He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his
      two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It
      has been identified with &#39;Asluj, a heap of ruins south
      of Beersheba. Conder, however, identifies it with Khirbet
      Zuheilikah, ruins found on three hills half a mile apart,
      some seventeen miles north-west of Beersheba, on the
      confines of Philistia, Judah, and Amalek.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003930"><b>Zillah -</b> shadow, one of the wives
      of Lamech, of the line of Cain, and mother of Tubal-cain
      (Gen. 4:19, 22).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003931"><b>Zilpah -</b> drooping, Leah&#39;s
      handmaid, and the mother of Gad and Asher (Gen.
      30:9-13).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003932"><b>Zilthai -</b> shadow (i.e.,
      protection) of Jehovah. (1.) A Benjamite (1 Chr. 8:20).
      (2.) One of the captains of the tribe of Manasseh who
      joined David at Ziklag (1 Chr. 12:20).</a>

      (3.) The father of Joah (2 Chr. 29:12).

    <p>
      <a name="T0003934"><b>Zimran -</b> vine-dressers;
      celebrated, one of the sons of Abraham by Keturah (Gen.
      25:2).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003935"><b>Zimri -</b> praise-worthy. (1.) A son
      of Salu, slain by Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, because of
      his wickedness in bringing a Midianitish woman into his
      tent (Num. 25:6-15).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (2.) Murdered Elah at Tirzah, and succeeded him on the
      throne of Israel (1 Kings 16:8-10). He reigned only seven
      days, for Omri, whom the army elected as king, laid siege
      to Tirzah, whereupon Zimri set fire to the palace and
      perished amid its ruins (11-20). Omri succeeded to the
      throne only after four years of fierce war with Tibni,
      another claimant to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="T0003936"><b>Zin -</b> a low palm-tree, the
      south-eastern corner of the desert et-Tih, the wilderness

      <a name="T0003938"><b>Zion -</b> sunny; height, one of the
      eminences on which Jerusalem was built. It was surrounded
      on all sides, except the north, by deep valleys, that of
      the Tyropoeon (q.v.) separating it from Moriah (q.v.),
      which it surpasses in height by 105 feet. It was the
      south-eastern hill of Jerusalem.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When David took it from the Jebusites (Josh. 15:63; 2 Sam.
      5:7) he built on it a citadel and a palace, and it became
      &quot;the city of David&quot; (1 Kings 8:1; 2 Kings 19:21,
      31; 1 Chr. 11:5). In the later books of the Old Testament
      this name was sometimes used (Ps. 87:2; 149:2; Isa. 33:14;
      Joel 2:1) to denote Jerusalem in general, and sometimes
      God&#39;s chosen Israel (Ps. 51:18; 87:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament (see SION &macr;T0003448) it is used
      sometimes to denote the Church of God (Heb. 12:22), and
      sometimes the heavenly city (Rev. 14:1).

      &quot;stronghold,&quot; the modern San). A city on the
      Tanitic branch of the Nile, called by the Greeks Tanis. It
      was built seven years after Hebron in Palestine (Num.
      13:22). This great and important city was the capital of
      the Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, who ruled Egypt for more
      than 500 years. It was the frontier town of Goshen. Here
      Pharaoh was holding his court at the time of his various
      interviews with Moses and Aaron. &quot;No trace of Zoan
      exists; Tanis was built over it, and city after city has
      been built over the ruins of that&quot; (Harper, Bible and
      Modern Discovery). Extensive mounds of ruins, the wreck of
      the ancient city, now mark its site (Isa. 19:11, 13; 30:4;
      Ezek. 30:14). &quot;The whole constitutes one of the
      grandest and oldest ruins in the world.&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This city was also called &quot;the Field of Zoan&quot;
      (Ps. 78:12, 43) and &quot;the Town of Rameses&quot; (q.v.),
      because the oppressor rebuilt and embellished it, probably
      by the forced labour of the Hebrews, and made it his
      northern capital.

      originally called Bela (14:2, 8). It is referred to by the
      prophets Isaiah (15:5) and Jeremiah (48:34). Its ruins are
      still seen at the opening of the ravine of Kerak, the
      Kir-Moab referred to in 2 Kings 3, the modern Tell

      rocky plateau near the centre of the village of Siloam, and
      near the fountain of En-rogel, to which the women of the
      village resort for water (1 Kings 1:5-9). Here Adonijah
      (q.v.) feasted all the royal princess except Solomon and
      the men who took part with him in his effort to succeed to
      the throne. While they were assembled here Solomon was
      proclaimed king, through the intervention of Nathan. On
      hearing this, adonijah fled and took refuge in the
      sanctuary (1 Kings 1:49-53). He was afterwards
      pardoned.</a>

      the crest of a hill overlooking the valley of Sorek, and
