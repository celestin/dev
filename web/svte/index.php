<p>Stour Valley Technical Services has moved on, and is a progression from Stour Valley Timber Engineering,
in as much as a greater range of services are available to a wider spectrum of companies within the construction industry.
Ownership of the <span class="tfe">Timber Frame Engineering</span><font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> software has been resumed.</p>

<p><b>Consultancy services</b> include:
<ul>
<li>Structural engineering services to domestic & commercial clients</li>
<li>Specialist timber frame engineering experience using software, <span class="tfe">Timber Frame Engineering</span><font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font></li>
<li>Light gauge steel frame experience</li>
<li>Draughting services</li>
<li>Domestic Building Regulation applications</li>
<li>Project management</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Site engineering services</b> include:
<ul>
<li>Topographical and level surveys: - detailed land surveys, with levels, for small to medium size plots.</li>
<li>Setting out: - for contractors and companies who do not require a full time site engineer.  We can provide a service to suit your requirements whereby we set out and provide levels for foundations, brickwork, drain runs and kerb lines etc.</li>
<li>Grid of levels. To accurately determine cut & fill quantities or extent of reduced level dig.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b><span class="tfe">Timber Frame Engineering</span><font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> software</b>
<ul>
<li>We provide specialist design software for purchase by other engineers in the timber frame industry. The software, <span class="tfe">Timber Frame Engineering</span><font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>, is easy to use and produces a consistent quality format output - every time, which is easy to read. It uses BS 5268 Parts 2 & 6.1 as its foundation and other relevant British Standards are utilised as required. A new version based on EC5 is currently in the process of being written. This release will be driven by demand for the software; so if you are interested please drop send an email to us so that we can see who is queuing up to be first off the mark with EC5.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The <b>EUROCODES</b> (BS EN 1990 - BS EN 1999) are now available for use for the
design of structures in all materials, and <b>BS EN 1995 for timber structures</b> is the one
that is of interest to all those designing in timber. Eurocode 0 series
(Basis of structural design) and Eurocode 1 series (Actions on structures)
will also be required. In addition to the BS EN codes themselves there are
also the National Application Documents, which provide additional guidance
applicable to each country; or ‘Member State’ in the language of the Eurocode.
We are now in the 2 year period of coexistence and the current date published
for withdrawal of the current National codes is March 2010. We are in the process of
creating a new version of the software to comply with the Eurocodes, and the current
release date is expected to be January 2009, subject to all documentation being
available from BSI.</p>

<h1>Coming soon...</h1>

<h2>Energy assessment services: Non-Domestic (Commercial) Energy Assessor Level 4 (DipNDEA)</h2>

<p>From 1st October 2008 Government started legally requiring all commercial properties being sold,
let or built and all homes being rented to have Energy Assessments.
All larger public buildings also now require Assessments, which must be renewed every year,
and homes for sale have required them since August 2007. Government brought in these new 'green'
environmental laws, which are permanent, to comply with the EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
Buildings being modified and resulting in the addition or removal of parts of the building and also buildings
having Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems installed or modified may also require an EPC.</p>

<p>In order to provide this service we are undergoing formal training to secure a qualification known as
<b>Non-Domestic (Commercial) Energy Assessor Level 4 (DipNDEA)</b> - for carrying out Energy Assessments
for large commercial properties. We expect to start offering this service from March 2009.
Updates will be posted, but please call me if  you would like to discuss this particular service and
maybe make an appointment to carry out pre-report assessment of you property.</p>

<p><i>Please note that this web site is regularly updated and further additional information will
be added in due course. Last updated: <b><? echo strftime("%B %Y"); ?></b></i>.</p>
