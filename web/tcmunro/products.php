                  Robinson greenhouses are top of the range products, giving true
                  Quality and Value for money. The aluminium framework (which
                  can be powder coated green) is very robust and strong. 4mm toughened
                  glass is supplied with every greenhouse and is supported on
                  substantial cushioning. The glass is held in evenly with a unique
                  capping system. Clips of any kind are NOT used. More growing
                  space is provided due to extra width, length and height compared
                  to other manufactures. Seeing is believing! Doors open to ground
                  level &ndash; no extra base required or to step over! Automatic
                  roof vents, gutter and rwp&rsquo;s all supplied as standard.
                  Dwarf wall models and bespoke buildings can be built to suit
                  particular sites. Robinsons customers are SATISFIED customers!<br></td>

                  This is a very good &lsquo;budget&rsquo; greenhouse, which can
                  be supplied in horticultural or toughened glass or Polycarbonate
                  and in aluminium or green finish. Standard sizes or High Eaves
                  models are available in most models. The base provided is NOT
                  steel but aluminium to match the framework. The glass is held
                  in by stainless steel flat clips, not &lsquo;W&rsquo; clips
                  which can make a difference. Automatic vent openers can be supplied.</td>

                  with a higher specification frame than most others. Horticultural

                  base supplied allowing doors to open almost to ground level.
                  Although clips are used to retain glass they are very strong
                  and do not blow out easily. A wide variety of lean-to&rsquo;s
                  are available as well as Octagonal and Hexagonal models. Narrow
                  4ft wide sizes to fit tight spaces are very useful. </td>
